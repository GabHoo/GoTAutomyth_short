Everything was quiet as the peace of Margaery Tyrell threatened one day Robert Baratheon.

On the first day of spring in Torrhen's square, Margaery met Tyrell Alerie and forged an alliance. Margaery Tyrell and Alerie Tyrell were almost in Karhold at night, when they realized that Robert Baratheon was after them, but the two friends were ready and the battle started. Margaery Tyrell used invisibility forcing the enemy to retreat. After the victory, peace was no longer under threat and Margaery and Alerie celebrated Tyrell at White Harbor by organizing a concert.",

Everything was quiet when Margaery Tyrell threatened the treasure of Petyr Baelish on a day’s end. Petyr Baelish was initially afraid, but with the help of Robert Arryn got stronger and learned invisibility. On the way to Winterfell at the first day of spring, Petyr Baelish met Lysa Arryn and they immediately became friends. After traveling through the whole kingdom Petyr Baelish finally found Margaery Tyrell in the Dreadfort. A bloody battle began but Petyr Baelish got the better of Margaery Tyrell thanks to invisibility powers.

During a long training session at The Twins at Christmas, Robert met Baratheon Gendry and immediately gathered around and decided to travel together. Robert Baratheon finally faced Cersei Lannister in Saltpans at night and the alliance scared off Cersei Lannister with the help of Gendry and thanks to the learned power of mind control. So he managed to salvage the treasure and celebrated with Gendry by playing a game in Seagard.",

"story": "Long ago Petyr Baelish, Lord of the House Tyrell was known as a bureaucrat very good. Petyr Baelish had an happy and peaceful life when Tyrion Lannister threatened the castle of Petyr Baelish. Petyr Baelish was initially scared, but with Lysa Arryn, he got stronger and learned military strategy. At Deepwood Motte in the first day of Spring, Petyr met Baelish Robert Arryn and formed an alliance. Petyr Baelish confronted Tyrion Lannister at the Autumnal Equinox in Karhold and his alliance with the help of Robert Arryn and thanks to the learned power of military strategy sabotaged Tyrion Lannister. This is how Petyr managed to save the castle and celebrated in Karhold with Robert Arryn by having a feast.",
