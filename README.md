# Story-Generator
Application to automatically generates Game Of Thrones spin-off stories based on Knowledge Graphs.

Stroy structure is inspired from the Hero Journey (https://skift.com/2016/10/28/the-heros-journey-a-human-framework-for-building-modern-travel-brands/)

To generate a stroy, run the Mega_generator.py file. 
Script takes three possible heuristics ["community", "relation","random"], which represent three way of picking instances of the main charachters from a Game Of Thrones ontology.
