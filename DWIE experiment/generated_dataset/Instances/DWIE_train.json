"story": "Multi-lingual in the World Wide Web Professional translators and interpreters beware! There\u2019s a new product out at CeBIT this year and it\u2019s set to make your job obsolete - or at least the more mundane portion of business correspondence. Imagine sitting in an office in Berlin, Paris or New York, typing an e-mail to an international colleague and getting a reply - all in one language. Sure, it\u2019s no problem if everyone speaks the same language. But what happens when three different languages are involved? You get a translator, right? Or you spend a little more time flipping through an English-German-French dictionary. Too expensive, too time consuming? Well, there\u2019s always the option of learning a foreign language. In the global business community, bilungualism is not a bad investment. But for those of you who didn\u2019t memorize the German irregular verbs in school and who still can\u2019t be bothered to remember the gender of French nouns, there\u2019s a technical solution: the Personal Translator by Linguatec. No, it\u2019s not a mini headset that automatically interprets your every thought - at least not yet. Linguatec is one of the leading innovators in the market for language recognition software, and it\u2019s unique Personal Translator (PT) program is getting better and more accurate every year. So far there are two language versions, German-English and German-French. Designed as a complete software package for easy installment on a normal PC or computer network, PT is ideal for the office environment. It\u2019s compatible with any system from Windows to Apple, and can be applied to any type of common text program including e-mails. With just a click of the mouse, the user can call on the extensive language database to translate any given text. And a link up through the user\u2019s browser connects to the e-Translation Server for translation in the internet. The PT can also be downloaded for cellular phones and Palmpilots for mobile translations - great for vacationing in foreign countries. The next step is the linguachat - an online service for automatic translation of texts in chat groups. Gone are the days of stumbling around for the correct English or German word, with Linguatec\u2019s browser function, users can simply chat away regardless of the language. Business of words Although there are several different international companies producing translation software, Linguatec offers the most comprehensive word and phrase databanks. It is also the only translation software that reads and analyses not only single sentences, but entire contexts to produce more accurate meaning. Whereas other companies such as the American Smartlink or Babelfish offer several different languages, Linguatec offers only three: German, English and French. This enables the company to concentrate on quality rather than quantity, an important factor in serious translation services, said a Linguatec spokesperson. This year\u2019s new and revised edition of the Personal Translator contains 620,000 words and 35,000 common idiomatic phrases. This enables the PT to recognize double meanings and colloquial speech patterns. In addition, users can expand their word base with specialty dictionaries from areas like banking, medicine and technology. The German company started out ten years ago producing German-English translation software on the basis of IBM technology. Originally the product was slow and required a lot of thorough editing after a text was translated by the system. Now it\u2019s being used by international companies like Siemens and Deutsche Bank. Even professional translators, who are generally skeptical of electronic translation software, are beginning to recognize the quality of the system, said a Linguatec spokesperson at CeBIT. \"When they have a long translation, they often let the PT run over the text once as a rough draft, before they fine tune it.\" Some translators and linguists are so impressed by the software, that they\u2019ve quit their regular jobs and have begun working for Linguatec developing more accurate translation technology.",

"story": "German Know-How For China's Energy Sector Energy is becoming a scarce resource in China and Beijing is looking for alternatives. On Friday, Germany's foreign minister inaugurated one of the largest German-Chinese joint ventures for solar energy there. The facility in Jinan is being billed as the largest solar collector plant in the world. The site in this eastern Chinese city, run by a Sino-German joint venture, produces solar collectors to heat water. It is a market that promises massive electricity savings in a country struggling with a potential shortfall this year of 30 million kilowatts. \"China has recognized the urgent ecological issues that go along with strong economic growth and the increasing need for energy,\" German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer told German business representatives at the inauguration ceremony. \"I am especially happy that China has made decisive steps towards using renewable energy and the development of a more environmentally-friendly energy sector,\" he added. Solar power instead of chocolate The joint venture is owned by the German vacuum tube solar collector manufacturer Paradigma, Karlsbad, and Chinese glass tubing producer Linuo in Jinan. Paradigma's major shareholder is Alfred Ritter, better-known for his chocolate company Ritter Sport. \"With this joint venture, we are following a strategy to go where the markets are,\" Ritter said. \"In China, we're producing for the Asian market, in Germany, for the European market.\" Germany sees the Shangdong Linuo Paradigma plant as the largest new venture in a virtually untapped market. \"There are extraordinary opportunities here not only for large corporations, but also for mid-sized and small German companies,\" said Fischer, who is currently touring Asia with a German business delegation. China's energy resources are running out China, the world's largest solar energy market, is facing its worst energy crisis since the 1980s. It has been set off by the rapid development of power-hungry industries such as automobiles, iron and steel, as well as rapid urbanization and a rise in living standards. Energy production relative to buying power is four times more expensive in China than in other industrialized nations. At the same time, it is drastically depleting its coal deposits and oil imports are soaring. The symptoms of the shortages are visible throughout China. In order to feed Beijing's growing energy needs, frequent blackouts occur across the country. Many companies have begun working at night and on weekends to avoid high-use periods and more than 6,000 companies in Beijing have ordered one-week paid vacations this summer to save energy.",

"story": "Trash crisis forces Lebanon's environmental awakening With Lebanon's garbage crisis in its second year, regular citizens are taking the problem of the ever-growing piles of trash into their own hands. This shift in consciousness represents a new reality for the government. When Kassem Kazak had the idea to start a recycling company with a friend in Lebanon, he didn't expect the extent to which his initiative would strike a nerve. Recycle Beirut, which Kazak launched at the end of 2014, was meant to provide an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional waste disposal, as well as create job opportunities for Syrian refugees in Lebanon. No one at Recycle Beirut had any experience in waste management; Kazak himself is an IT engineer. \"We became friends with the people who collect the trash at night,\" Kazak said. \"They showed us how waste management in Lebanon works.\" The team at Recycle Beirut quickly realized that the concept of recycling was little-known in Lebanon, and that recycling plants simply didn't exist in the country. \"There is not much sorting from the source, because there are not many efforts to collect the recycled trash. And this is where the problem lies,\" Kazak said. Here's where Recycle Beirut stepped in. Since early 2015, trucks from the company have driven through the streets of the Lebanese capital, collecting recycled waste from private households. The waste is collected in a warehouse and eventually brought to the individual waste processing plants. Kazak soon realized that, in addition to the logistical hurdles, their main challenge was to introduce recycling culture to Lebanon. Events in the summer of 2015, when trash began piling up on the streets, played a major part. Grassroots campaign Up until 2015, waste disposal was mainly taken care of by a private company, Sukleen. Collected waste was briefly processed, if at all, then dumped in a landfill near the city of Naameh, south of Beirut. Sukleen kept using the site near Naameh even after capacity was reached. When protesting residents managed to close the landfill in July 2015, Sukleen - in the absence of an alternative plan - simply stopped collecting garbage, and trash began piling up in the streets of Lebanon. A month later, the You Stink! grassroots movement brought more than 200,000 people to the streets to demand that the government come up with an economical and ecological plan to dispose of the waste. More than a year later, the government still hasn't found a solution. But this inaction has spurred citizens to act, and Recycle Beirut has consequently seen its business grow. Today, the company employs 17 Syrian refugees and sends out three trucks every day to pick up 2 to 3 tons of pre-sorted waste. This new focus on recycling is also reflected in the number of households who have signed up with Recycle Beirut, which has risen from a dozen to more than 1,100. Consciousness shift Journalist Kareem Chehayeb, who has actively participated in the garbage protests, has noticed increased awareness among the Lebanese population when it comes to environmental issues. This has been especially visible in the reactions from politicians. \"For the first time, we see politicians from both sides becoming active and discussing their solutions in the media,\" said Chehayeb. Another sign of the consciousness shift has been reflected in the business world. \"Every company brags about how green they are,\" he told DW. \"True or not, it shows that there is a demand.\" This new awareness is also reflected in the many environmental movements and nongovernmental organizations that have emerged in the course of the protests, especially at the universities. Chehayeb, however, is critical of this development. \"This commitment is nice, but a lot of NGOs do what the state should be doing,\" he pointed out. \"My concern is if more NGOs become active, they will do the job that the government should be doing. \"We pay taxes for it, and the taxes shouldn't channeled away from that. The government has a responsibility.\" Financial incentives bring about change Environmental engineer Ziad Abichaker has chosen to throw in his support with the community activists. With his organization, Cedar Environmental, he has been building recycling plants since 2009. \"The only way you can convince [the government] is with results, and showing that they make good financial sense for the municipality,\" he explained. In September, Cedar Environmental launched a new zero-waste facility in Beit Mery, 15 kilometers (around 9 miles) east of Beirut. The facility processes about a ton of municipal waste for $62 (around 58 euros); Sukleen processed the same amount for $130. \"We offered a solution where they not only get the garbage off the street, but also save 50 percent,\" said Abichaker. In the end, Lebanon's waste crisis has forced municipalities to introduce recycling. \"Nobody accepts the old practices any more,\" said Abichaker. Private citizens have woken up and discovered the alternatives - and the government will have to get used to this new reality.",

"story": "Iran calls for end to Saudi air campaign, as US warns Tehran over Yemen Iran's president has called for an end to Saudi-led airstrikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen. This came after the United States warned Tehran against its alleged involvement in the conflict in Yemen. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani used an address broadcast live on national television on Thursday to call on the coalition led by Saudi Arabia to immediately halt its campaign of air strikes on the Shiite Houthi rebels seeking to overthrow Yemeni President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Shiite Iran is widely thought to be supporting the rebels, while Sunni Saudi Arabia supports President Hadi, who fled to the Saudi capital, Riyadh over a week ago, as Houthi forces approached his southern Yemen stronghold of Aden. Earlier, Iran's naval commander announced that two war ships were being deployed to the Gulf of Aden, in a move seen as raising tensions in the region. Habibollah Sajjari, though, said in remarks reported by Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency that the redeployment was meant only to protect commercial shipping lanes from the threat of attack by pirates. Meanwhile, the United States has warned Tehran against meddling in the conflict in Yemen. US Secretary of State John Kerry told the American public broadcaster PBS on Wednesday that Washington would stand by its allies in the Middle East, who in light of the current conflict in Yemen felt threatened by Iran. \"We're not looking for confrontation, obviously, but we're not going to step away from our alliances and our friendships and the need to stand with those who feel threatened as a consequence of the choices that Iran might be making,\" Kerry said. Situation in Aden 'nearly catastrophic' Meanwhile, heavy fighting was reported on Wednesday between forces loyal to President Hadi and the Houthi rebels who are still trying to take control of the southern port of Aden, which relief workers have warned is facing a humanitarian catastrophe. A spokesperson of for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Yemen told the Reuters news agency that the situation in Aden was \"nearly catastrophic.\" \"Shops are closed, so people cannot get food, they cannot get water. There are still dead bodies in the street. Hospitals are extremely exhausted,\" Marie Claire Feghali said. Another aid organization, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), though, said a ship carrying 2.5 tonnes of medicine had docked in Aden's port on Wednesday, marking the first medicinal aid shipment since the fighting broke out in the city three weeks ago. The ICRC also said that a surgical team had arrived by boat in Aden. pfd/jil (Reuters, dpa, AP)",

"story": "Ai Weiwei Drifting Ai Weiwei: Uncomfortable critic or one of the most brilliant artists of our time? Subject to government surveillance, detention and house arrest in China he moved to Berlin in 2015. Now he's taking Europe to task, protesting against, and devoting his work, to what he sees as its catastrophic refugee policies. A DW film team has been following him around the world for more than a year. A lonely rubber boat is drifting in the Aegean Sea between Turkey and Greece. In it, Ai Weiwei. He cannot swim. Is this performance art? \"We are all refugees,\" he says. Ai Weiwei displays his solidarity with the refugees and goes to meet them in Greece, Turkey and Gaza, producing a major documentary on the way. His current works deal with the fate of refugees, turning their abandoned boats, life vests and discarded clothing into memorials. Flight and exile have been constant themes in his life. He is currently writing his memoirs, set for publication in 20 languages. His father, a well-known poet, fell into disfavor during Mao's Cultural Revolution and Ai Weiwei grew up in exile. As the Einstein Visiting Professor at Berlin's University of the Arts, he also sets his students project work on the refugee issue. But when Ai Weiwei imitated the photo of the dead refugee boy Alan Kurdi with his own body, many thought he was going too far. Was it sensationalism? Provocation? \"Oh,\" he seemed to say, \"so now you care?\" Ai Weiwei recognizes no boundaries. Our film gets close to him and gives us an insight into his artistic work as well as his private life - with his mother in Beijing, with his son and partner in Berlin and in moments never before shown on film. But a lot about him remains a riddle. Just who exactly is Ai Weiwei?

"story": "Turkey summons German envoy for second time in two days Ankara has summoned Germany's ambassador for the second time in as many days with tensions between the two countries showing no sign of ending. It is the 17th time Berlin's envoy has been summoned in two years. Germany's ambassador to Ankara was called in to Turkey's Foreign Ministry on Monday just 48 hours after responding to a previous summons over the weekend, German officials said. German Foreign Office spokesman Martin Sch\u00e4fer confirmed the summons, but did not elaborate on what the reason was. The spokesman noted, however, that it was the 17th time Ambassador Martin Erdmann had received such an order since he began his tenure as Berlin's envoy to Ankara in 2015. Read more: Can Merkel push the EU toward a new Turkey policy? Sch\u00e4fer noted that the number of summonses that Erdmann had received was \"very unusual\" between \"partners within NATO.\" German news magazine Der Spiegel reported that Erdmann was summoned over a German parliamentary motion last year that declared the 1915 massacre of Armenians by Ottoman forces as a genocide. Turkey has long fiercely rejected the term. Read more: Turkey: Is Germany Recep Tayyip Erdogan's 'best enemy?' Summons over Kurdish rally Erdmann was previously summoned on Saturday over a Kurdish festival that was held in the western German city of Cologne. The slogan of the festival referred to Abdullah Oclan, the jailed leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) which has been designated as a terrorist group in the European Union and Turkey. Turkey's Foreign Ministry said on Saturday that the country's condemnation of the Cologne event was relayed to the German ambassador. Summoning an ambassador is one of the harshest diplomatic protest measures a country can order. Germany's Foreign Office has also summoned Turkey's ambassador multiple times \u2013 most recently over Turkey's imprisonment of human rights activist Peter Steudtner. Relations between the two countries plummeted after a series of diplomatic crises that followed last year's failed attempt to overthrow President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Berlin has strongly criticized Ankara's post-coup crackdown that has seen over 50,000 people arrested. rs/kl (AFP, dpa)",

"story": "Medvedev seeks investment at Davos economic forum More than 2,500 business leaders, lobbyists, economists and politicians have convened in the Swiss ski resort Davos for the World Economic Forum. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was among the first major speakers. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev urged foreign investors to pump more capital into Russia in his keynote speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday. Medvedev said increased external investment was crucial for the government to meet its goal of raising annual economic growth figures from 3.5 percent to Moscow's desired 5 percent. \"We have very ambitious goals in the investment field, to increase the volume of investment from 20 to 25 percent of GDP, to increase investment in transportation, in energy infrastructure \u2026 and foreign direct investment would be instrumental in achieving this goal,\" Medvedev said. Medvedev pointed to Russia joining the World Trade Organization as a sign of progress, but also acknowledged that his country might suffer from an image problem on the global stage. 'Resilient dynamism' The Russian prime minister, whose country holds the rotating G20 presidency, was the first major political speaker at the economic summit, which runs through Saturday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is to address some of the roughly 2,500 business leaders in the Swiss ski resort on Thursday afternoon, as will British Prime Minister David Cameron - who on Wednesday pledged an \"in/out\" UK referendum on EU membership, if he wins re-election. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti and Israeli President Shimon Peres are among the other major scheduled speakers. Organizers chose the 2013 motto \"resilient dynamism,\" saying it pointed to required improvements in the global economy so that it could better cope with issues like the ongoing sovereign debt difficulties in the eurozone. The forum officially opened with a welcoming address and party on Tuesday night, with the participants getting down to business on Wednesday. msh/dr (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

"story": "Ex-CIA fugitive Robert Seldon Lady detained in Panama Former CIA station chief Robert Seldon Lady has been detained in Panama. In 2009 he was convicted in absentia in Italy of kidnapping a Muslim cleric in what was the first trial involving the CIA's rendition program Former CIA Milan base chief Robert Seldon Lady has been detained in Panama, Panamanian and Italian officials said late Thursday. Interpol had issued a request for Lady's arrest. It was not immediately clear where Lady would be taken as Italy and Panama have no bilateral extradition treaty. In 2009, an Italian judge sentenced 23 CIA employees, including Lady, in absentia for the abduction of the Egyptian cleric Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr. The imam, also known as Abu Omar, was taken from a Milan street in 2003 and flown to Egypt for interrogation, where he claims he was tortured. Lady had left Italy early into the Italian investigation and retired from the CIA. He was handed a nine-year jail term, which merits an extradition request under Italian legal guidelines. It was the first trial in the world involving the CIA's extraordinary rendition program. Such renditions, which most famously took terror suspects to the US detainment facility at Guantanamo Bay, were part of the policies launched in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks by then-US President George W. Bush. In February, Italy's former military intelligence chief, Nicolo Pollari, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in the kidnapping. hc/av (Reuters, AP)",

"story": "Nearly 10,000 migrants rescued on Mediterranean in two days Italy witnessed a surge of migrant arrivals at the end of August amid favorable weather conditions on the sea. Rome has warned would-be migrants of the perils of the deadly voyage after 3,000 died this year. The Italian coastguard on Tuesday rescued some 3,000 migrants in the Strait of Sicily with the aid of the EU's border agency Frontex and humanitarian organizations, bringing the total to nearly 10,000 in two days. Italy has witnessed a surge in migrant arrivals due to favorable weather conditions on the central Mediterranean Sea, with Monday marking one of the highest single-day rescue operations. \"Nearly 7,000 people in a day is really quite a lot. If it's not a record, then it's close to it,\" said International Organization for Migration (IOM) spokesman Flavio Di Giacomo. More than 100,000 migrants have made the perilous journey across the central Mediterranean in 2016, many of them fleeing conflict and extreme poverty in Africa and the Middle East. Some 3,000 of them are estimated to have died during the journey this year. However, the number of migrants arriving to the EU has fallen compared to the same period last year. IOM said some 12,600 people made it to the bloc in August, down from 23,500 in the same month last year. In July, Italy's interior ministry launched a media campaign in partnership with IOM in a bid to dissuade African migrants from making the deadly journey across the Mediterranean. The \"Migrants Aware\" campaign featured content in English, Arabic and French, and targeted 15 countries in North and sub-Saharan Africa. However, thousands of migrants continue to make the voyage since the campaign was launched. More than 1 million migrants fled to Europe in 2015, according to IOM figures, prompting a political crisis among EU member states as to which countries will host them. ls/gsw (Reuters, dpa)",

"story": "Parents of US hostage Kayla Jean Mueller issue appeal to 'IS' captors The parents of a US humanitarian aid worker who her captors claim was killed in a Jordanian airstrike have said they are hopeful that she is still alive. They have also asked their daughter's captors to contact them. Carl and Marsha Mueller, the parents of 26-year-old Kayla Jean Mueller, released a statement on Friday in which they appealed to \"Islamic State\" (IS) militants, who have claimed to be holding their daughter, to contact them privately. The statement came after the jihadis claimed earlier in the day that Kayla Jean Mueller had been killed in an airstrike by Jordanian fighter jets on the building where she was being held captive in the Syrian city of Raqqa. \"This news leaves us concerned, yet, we are still hopeful that Kayla is alive,\" the parents said in the statement. Addressing directly \"those in positions of responsibility for holding Kayla,\" the parents said: \"You told us that you treated Kayla as your guest, as your guest her safety and well-being remains your responsibility.\" Mueller, of the US state of Arizona, had been working for a humanitarian aid organization when she was seized by IS militants while leaving a hospital in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo in August 2013. No US confirmation US officials said on Friday that they were unable to confirm the IS claim that Mueller had been killed. \"We are obviously deeply concerned by these reports. We have not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates ISIL's claim,\" National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said, referring to the IS by an acronym that they previously used. Jordan, meanwhile, questioned the jihadist group's claim.

"story": "Clinton campaign dogged by 'drip, drip' email scandal This week's State Department report stopped short of saying Clinton had committed a crime, but it was still a stinging rebuke. The new Washington parlor game is guessing what impact the report will have on an FBI probe. The news got worse this week for US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton after an internal report by the State Department's inspector general criticized the former secretary's use of a private email server for both her personal and government correspondence from 2009 to 2013. Frank Sesno, the director of the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University in the US capital, gave the report a 6 on a scale of 1-10, with a 10 being devastatingly bad. According to the report, Clinton's use of a private email server was \"not an appropriate method\" for preserving those emails, which is a far cry from a malevolent act that could possibly result in a criminal indictment - though that remains a possibility as an FBI investigation into her email use continues. \"There is nothing felonious in the report,\" Sesno said. \"It doesn't cause political harm. But it gives plenty of material to her political opponents.\" By itself the email scandal would likely have done little damage to Clinton's campaign. However, the accusations don't exist in a vacuum, but rather against a backdrop of questionable events and scandals that have dogged the former senator and first lady since her husband, Bill Clinton, rose to national prominence during his own presidential campaign in the early 1990s. During Clinton's 1993-2001 presidency, the couple were under relentless attack from their political opponents. A special prosecutor came up empty in his investigations into an array of scandals - except for one: that Bill Clinton lied under oath about an affair with a White House intern. Despite the fact that there were no other findings of wrongdoing, the impression of general impropriety has been seared into the public psyche ever since. For example, Republicans continue to question then-Secretary Hillary Clinton's role in the September 11, 2012, events at the US consulate in Benghazi Libya, when the diplomatic post was attacked by militants and four Americans, including the ambassador, were killed. The report released Wednesday by State Department Inspector General Steve A. Linick plays into \"this albatross narrative of untrustworthiness,\" Sesno said - \"this drip, drip, damage she's got going.\" 'Anything but' The public's doubt has only been fanned by the fact that, though she later admitted it was problematic, Clinton had initially denied doing anything wrong by routing government and personal correspondence through a single account on a server set up in her private home in New York state.Clinton ostensibly did this because she didn't want to have two accounts and two phones. The basic problems with this arrangement are twofold. First, as secretary of state, Clinton dealt with classified and top-secret information, which is only supposed to be sent through secure government servers. So far it seems that little, if any, of the correspondence in question was classified at the time it was sent or received. And there is no indication that national security was at all compromised. Second, as a top-level official, Clinton's correspondence is supposed to be preserved as part of the historical record and an accounting of public servants' work. It was only once the scandal broke - over a year after Clinton left office - that she turned over tens of thousands of emails that had been stored on her private server. But thousands of others, which she claims were personal emails, were erased. In an interview with the US television network NBC earlier this week, Clinton acknowledged again that her email arrangement had been a mistake. \"I think it's pretty clear looking back what I thought was convenient turned out to be anything but,\" Clinton said. \"And, as I have acknowledged, I should have just used two accounts.\" It is a mistake that Clinton has paid a heavy price for. When she left the State Department her favorability rating was pushing 65 percent; now she has slipped below 40 percent among registered voters. Under attack With the primaries drawing to a close in the next two weeks, Bernie Sanders, Clinton's rival for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, has only the slimmest mathematical chance of wresting the nomination from her, but he persists in attacking her from the left. Meanwhile, the presumptive Republican nominee, real estate magnate and former reality TV star Donald Trump, is relentlessly attacking her from the right. Add in the stinging report from the State Department inspector general and the ongoing FBI probe into whether her private server broke the law, and Clinton is a candidate under siege. The big question in Washington now is what impact the report could have on the FBI investigation.And there is one line from the report that could be devastating for Clinton. According to the report, two members of the State Department's IT staff were told \"never to speak of the secretary's personal email system again\"after they raised concerns about Clinton's unconventional setup. It will be up to the FBI to determine whether this was a matter of a senior official telling underlings that everything was fine or a warning to government employees to keep their mouths shut. The latter sounds like a cover-up - and that would be a crime. \"The parlor game in Washington now is: 'Does the IG report feed into whether she'll be indicted?'\" Sesno said. There's no word when the FBI's investigation will be concluded, but the agency is under considerable pressure to draw its conclusions quickly - and certainly well ahead of the November presidential election. Whenever it happens, there are three basic possibilities for the conclusion of the FBI investigation: \u00b7 The agency could find no criminal wrongdoing and issue a mild rebuke (a prospect that seems less likely given the harsh tone of the State Department report). \u00b7 It could find no criminal wrongdoing but issue a harsh rebuke. \u00b7 It could find that a crime was committed and file charges. The first conclusion would not only clear Clinton's name but rob her political opponents of much needed ammunition as they battle for the White House. The second would clear her, but Trump would surely seize on the findings to peddle his \"crooked Hillary\" motif with gusto. The third conclusion, criminal charges, would very likely force her out of the race. But, if you think Clinton's campaign is dead in the water, think again. Despite it all, oddsmakers still consider Hillary Clinton the favorite to become the next president of the United States.",

"story": "Simon Wiesenthal: The Life of a Nazi Hunter Some called him the Nazi Hunter, but in reality he was just a normal man looking to make sure that justice was served. On December 31, 2008, Simon Wiesenthal would have celebrated his 100th birthday. Simon Wiesenthal once said that his purpose in life was to warn the murderers of tomorrow that they will never find rest. If he couldn't do that, then millions of people died for nothing. He was referring to victims of the Nazi Holocaust of World War II. Wiesenthal was a voice for the survivors of the Holocaust, but also for those who lost their lives in the concentration camps. Wiesenthal worked most of his life making sure that these crimes against humanity would never be hushed up or whitewashed. Some people labeled him a \u201cjustice fanatic\u201d, others viewed him as a role model and hero. The early years Simon Wiesenthal was born on Dec. 31, 1908, to a Jewish family living in Galicia, which at the time was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He studied architecture in Lemburg and was able to pursue that passion until 1940, when the German army marched in and took over. Wiesenthal spent the next several years in countless forced labor and concentration camps. In 1945 Wiesenthal was among those freed from the Mauthausen death camp in Austria by the US army. It was shortly thereafter that he was reunited with the love of his life, Cyla, whose entire family was killed by the Nazis. Life's work It was in that same year that Wiesenthal started his real life's work: hunting down and capturing former members of the Nazi party. He was contracted by the US government to take on this task and drew on his experiences and memories from the war to accomplish it. He even recalled many of the perpetrator's names from his time in concentration camps. Two years later Wiesenthal, along with other survivors, founded a center for the documentation of crimes committed against European Jews in Linz, Austria. In 1961 a Jewish Documentation Center in Vienna was created. Soon the small office there was filled with documents, notes, memorabilia and evidence. The Americans followed the example, and by 1977 there was a similar institution established in Los Angeles named in Wiesenthal's honor. Nazi hunter Wiesenthal contributed to the capture of many prominent Nazis, including Adolf Eichmann, who was put on trial in Israel in 1961; Franz Stangl, Commandant of the Treblinka concentration camp; and Hermine Braunsteiner, who was responsible for the murder of hundreds of children at the Majdanek concentration camp. Simon Wiesenthal always considered himself a researcher who was simply working to make sure the Holocaust would never be forgotten and that the perpetrators would be brought to justice. Guilt, he always stressed, was individual. He never wanted to be a hate-driven Nazi hunter, saying that hate was a foreign emotion to him. For sixty years Wiesenthal collected, researched and documented \u2013 living deep in his dark memories. He was been honored multiple times for his life's work. Simon Wiesenthal died on September 20, 2005 at the age of 96.",

"story": "Hollywood women launch anti-harassment campaign Hundreds of women working in Hollywood's entertainment industry have unveiled an initiative to help victims of sexual harassment in the US. It aims to ensure survivors have access to justice and support. More than 300 women working for Hollywood as top actors, directors, writers and other media executives on Monday launched an initiative to combat widespread sexual harassment across the United States. An open letter, published as a full-page ad in the New York Times and the Spanish-language La Opinion, introduced the \"Time's Up\" campaign, outlining a call for change that demands accountability from perpetrators, access to justice and support for victims and survivors, and gender equality. Read more: Time names 'The Silence Breakers' Person of the Year \"We want all survivors of sexual harassment, everywhere, to be heard, to be believed, and know that accountability is possible,\" the letter says. The campaign has an emphasis on providing support for women in working-class jobs and includes a Legal Defense Fund, which has already accumulated $13.4 million (\u20ac11.17 million). Read more: Hollywood chooses Anita Hill to lead anti-sexual harassment commission \"We also want all victims and survivors to be able to access justice and support for the wrongdoing they have endured,\" the letter adds. \"We particularly want to lift up the voices, power and strength of women working in low-wage industries where the lack of financial stability makes them vulnerable to high rates of gender-based violence and exploitation.\" Imbalance of power The letter emphasized the role systematic gender inequality and imbalance of power played in fostering an environment that is \"ripe for abuse and harassment against women.\" \"Harassment too often persists because perpetrators and employers never have consequences. This is often because survivors, particularly those working in low-wage industries, don't have the resources to fight back,\" the letter says.

"story": "Modi, Merkel seek deeper trade ties at Hannover Messe India's visiting prime minister and Chancellor Angela Merkel have called for closer commercial cooperation between the two countries. India is the partner nation to this year's industrial trade fair in Hanover. The German chancellor advocated relaunching talks on an EU free trade deal with India at the opening of the \"Hannover Messe\" - Germany and the world's largest industrial trade fair - on Sunday evening. \"Trade between Germany and India can still be improved, although Germany is already India's largest European trading partner,\" Merkel said in the northern German city. Later on the opening evening, both Merkel and Prime Minister Narendra Modi took part in various bilateral trade discussions organized as part of the trade fair. Roughly 400 industry representatives from the partner country India are expected at an event with around 6,500 exhibitors from 70 nations. \"Germany has done more than any other Western country to tap India's world of business,\" said Modi, who is promoting his \"Make in India\" campaign, an appeal to international companies to manufacture their products in India. He offered German firms present in Hanover on Sunday the chance to partner in the building of a new India. Modi said that the opportunities for investors were vast, saying his government's first priority was establishing first-world-standard infrastructure. \"India is standing ready to welcome the whole world with open arms,\" Modi said. Room to grow According to provisional figures from Germany's Destatis statistics agency, trade between Germany and India was worth a total of 15.9 billion euros ($16.8 billion) in 2014. That figure, which has fallen for three consecutive years, puts India just 25th in terms of trade volume with Germany, behind countries including Romania, Slovakia, Japan and South Korea. Trade with third-largest partner and Indian rival China, by contrast, was estimated at close to 154 billion euros. \"We are pleased that your country is on a path of reform,\" Merkel said to Modi, who won last year's elections in India on a campaign platform to cut bureaucratic red tape and revitalize the economy. The chancellor also addressed the trade fair's other motto, \"Integrated Industry - Join the Network,\" as this year's Hannover Messe seeks to showcase future industrial production methods. This is sometimes referred to as \"Industry 4.0,\" with the new era seen as a fourth industrial revolution following steam power, the production line and then automation. Merkel lamented the EU's need to catch up on issues like digitalization: \"We in Europe simply must get a move on, just as we in Germany must also get our skates on,\" Merkel said. \"We have to adapt on a daily basis.\" Modi, who was in France over the weekend penning major defense deals and visiting Airbus, remains in Berlin until Tuesday. He will hold talks with leading Social Democrats, Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel and Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, while in the country. The 64-year-old premier is set to hold talks with Merkel at the chancellery on Tuesday, prior to flying out for the last leg of his international tour, in Canada.

"story": "Air Berlin Executives Accused of Insider Trading German prosecutors said on Tuesday that they had raided the homes and offices of top executives of German low-cost carrier Air Berlin as part of an investigation into possible insider trading. About 50 police officers and employees of the financial sector watchdog BaFin had searched a total of 10 premises in Berlin, Stuttgart, Munich, D\u00fcsseldorf and Langenfeld on Tuesday morning as part of the probe, the Stuttgart public prosecutors said in a statement. The investigation centered on at least five officials, including chief executive Joachim Hunold, and supervisory board head Johannes Zurnieden, they added. The insider trading allegations are connected with Air Berlin's takeover of rival airline DBA last year. \"There is a suspicion that the accused made use of insider knowledge over the planned takeover of a Munich-based airline by a Berlin-based airline,\" the prosecutors' statement said. Effect on stock price was unclear The company officials are suspected of having bought around 1.5 million euros ($2.0 million) of Air Berlin shares in June 2006, shortly after having signed a confidentiality agreement and just before takeover talks began. Hunold and Zurnieden are suspected of having bought 1.47 million euros worth of shares alone, the prosecutors said. Hunold, a media-savvy businessman who has led the airline's rapid expansion, confirmed he was among those named in the inquiry and issued a statement denying the allegations. \"There was no knowing how much or even if the share price of Air Berlin would rise after the announcement,\" he said. \"I first bought shares at the start of June 2006 when a lock-up period imposed on me under stock-exchange rules had expired.\" He said all the purchases had been duly reported to financial regulators and disclosed online. \"Absurd inquiry\" Air Berlin spokesman Peter Hauptvogel added that the shares were bought well before Air Berlin decided to buy DBA, a move that sent the Berlin airline's stocks soaring. Hauptvogel, who said searches were also made at the homes of the suspects, described the inquiry as \"absurd,\" adding that it involved relatively modest sums of money. Air Berlin, Germany's second largest airline after Lufthansa, acquired DBA in August 2006 in a bid to take on flag carrier Lufthansa in the fierce battle for domination in the skies above Germany.",

"story": "Expert: Election Outcome Won't Hurt Bavaria's CSU Bavaria's ruling Christian Social Union has dropped in the polls ever since 2003. But the party's fear of losing political clout after Sunday's election is unfounded, says a leading German political scientist. Ahead of Sunday's state elections in Bavaria that could have implications for the strength of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), DW-WORLD.DE spoke to Heinrich Oberreuter, a political scientist at the University of Passau and director of the Academy for Civic Education in Tutzing, who is close to the Christian Social Union (CSU). DW-WORLD.DE: Bavaria is the wealthiest state in Germany, home to giants like BMW, Siemens and other high tech industries. Its school system is regarded as Germany's best. Since the 1960s, the CSU has governed Bavaria by an absolute majority. In the last elections, the party got over 60 percent of the vote, but the polls indicate that state premier Guenther Beckstein is slightly below the 50 percent threshold required for his party to maintain sole leadership. What accounts for this drop? Heinrich Oberreuter: First of all, the new leadership hasn't succeeded in getting across the message to voters that they really do have it good. Voters take that for granted, they see it as normal that they have it so good. Since the last elections, there was a turbulent period when the CSU lost some of its voter base, because of budget cuts or policies such as introducing university fees at public institutions or cutting the number of years devoted to secondary education (from 9 years to 8 years) without involving the public in a real public debate over the matter. Those who felt short changed are distancing themselves from the party, which was also hurt by the crisis in confidence caused by the Edmund Stoiber affair (in which the former premier mishandled allegations that an aide had snooped into the private affairs of another CSU politician). Stoiber however is a dynamic politician with magnetic appeal as was (late former Bavarian Premier Franz Josef) Strauss, a titan on the national and world stage. Their successors Beckstein and (CSU pary leader) Erwin Huber lack that kind of charisma and together they have not been able to excite voters or bring them together to support a fresh vision. Under the CSU leadership, Bavaria has become very modern in the high-tech sense, but the party still struggles with an image problem. It is perceived as clinging to traditional social values and Catholic Church doctrine in a Europe that has become increasingly secular. Can you give an example of this? One can say that the CSU took longer than the other parties to react to the trend that mothers are working outside the home -- that there is a demand for initiatives that enable women to combine careers with raising a family, which makes issues such as affordable day care paramount. This is something that the party supports and it is putting its money where its mouth is, but the CSU's public image hasn't caught up with that reality. What are some of the campaign issues? Let's look at educational policy, which is a state matter in Germany. There doesn't seem to be much of a difference between the CSU and the opposition parties (Social Democrats, Greens, Free Democrats), or is there? The only difference I see between them is a minor one, the age-old debate about how long pupils stay together in the primary school system, before they are tracked into the three different secondary paths (based on academic ability). The CSU says we should keep the status quo -- four years is enough and the opposition says let's prolong the primary years and make it six or seven years before the pupils are tracked. That is not a fundamental difference. What other campaign issues are there? The SPD opposition has brought up the issue of regional differences in economic development -- prosperous regions and not so prosperous ones. But one has to say in the last year or so that the CSU has truly made an effort to bridge the differences. They don't want big population shifts to the bigger cities where the jobs are. The unemployment rates are higher outside the metropolitan areas, but still lower than the federal average of 6.7 percent. Other Germans move to Bavaria, because that's where the jobs are. That's why there's been a huge wave of Germans from the (poorer) eastern states. Since so many Bavarian residents come from elsewhere, such as the former East Germany, does that mean that they don't have the same loyalty to the CSU party as native-born Bavarians do? Maybe that accounts for a drop in the polls? No, Germans from other regions -- from the east, north, wherever, cast their votes based on pocketbook issues, on which party contributes to their sense of well-being. On that basis, they have no reason not to vote for the CSU. But isn't the CSU party itself very strongly identified with what it means to be Bavarian? No, I'm not really convinced of that. The drop in the polls doesn't really have to do with identity issues, but with voters' perceptions of what a political party has done for them. This fear of falling just under this symbolic 50 percent threshold is based on the assumption that the CSU's political weight on the national and European level would be greatly diminished. But its weight won't really be diminished? I wouldn't attach too much importance to this 50 percent symbol-- it's only relevant in terms of the party's confidence in itself. The CSU would still have a broad mandate to govern. And even though Frau Merkel may not see it now -- when she wants to build her coalition without the support of the Social Democrats in the federal elections next year -- she can be thankful to every CSU deputy who comes from Bavaria. So if the CSU manages to capture 47 percent of Bavaria's voters, that's still good? Nowhere else in Europe has one single party been able to capture such a big swath of voters as the CSU in Bavaria. I still expect them being to be able to govern with an absolute majority. So what results do you anticipate on Sunday? For the CSU: 49-51 percent, the SPD around 20 percent, the Greens 8 percent, FDP 6-7 percent. According to the polls, the Free Voters' Party could capture 8 percent, but I doubt it and I don't see the Left Party, which is essentially a protest party for unhappy campers, (crossing the 5 percent hurdle for a seat in the state parliament). After all, no state in all of Germany has it better than Bavaria.",

"story": "German parliament approves eurozone rescue package Following a fiery debate, Chancellor Angela Merkel's plan to throw 148 billion euros into a new eurozone rescue package was approved by parliament on Friday. Opposition parties, however, withheld their support. Both houses of parliament have approved Germany's portion of a 750 billion euro ($920 billion) rescue package from the European Union and International Monetary Fund for struggling eurozone economies. The result of the vote in the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, reflected a heated debate, with 319 \"yes\" votes, 73 \"no\" votes and 195 abstentions. The abstentions came from the center-left opposition Greens and Social Democrats (SPD). Leaders of the SPD had said they would vote for the plan only if Chancellor Angela Merkel's government agreed to support a tax on some international financial transactions. Merkel strongly supports the rescue package, calling it necessary for a \"culture of stability\" in the eurozone, and told parliament earlier this week, \"If the euro fails, then Europe fails.\" During the parliamentary debate, Sigmar Gabriel, party leader of the SPD, sharply criticized Merkel's handling of the euro crisis, saying her indecision has isolated Germany in Europe. \"You were only a courageous chancellor as long as you were protected by the Social Democrats,\" he said directly to Merkel, referring to the previous \"grand coalition\" government of the SPD and Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU). Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle shot back at Gabriel, saying his opposition was motivated by party politics. \"Do you think Europe should stand, or that it should fall?\" he said. \"Abstention [on this vote] is not principled, it's inconsistency.\" Speaking on the proposed international transaction tax, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told lawmakers that anticipation of the tax was pushing markets down, and that only prompt action on the tax decision will stabilize the markets. \"The reality is that the markets look more at Germany than at Cyprus or Malta,\" he said. \"So it is right, in order to win markets' confidence, that we decide so quickly.\" Inter-party divisions Germany would provide 148 billion euros ($186 million) to finance the bailout, and while the SPD has said it is not ideologically against the plan, the center-left party thinks the financial sector should pay its share to resolve the crisis many believe it helped create. Although Merkel's coalition was able to pass the bailout without opposition votes, cross-party support was expected to smooth over fierce opposition among Germans who see themselves as footing the bill for other countries' mistakes. The smaller opposition Greens also abstained from the vote, while the Left Party voted against it. The CDU and coalition Free Democrats have a majority in the lower house, the Bundestag, but their majority in the upper house, the Bundesrat, was scuppered after last week's election in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. acb/dpa/apn Editor: Martin Kuebler",

"story": "Belgium police arrest two brothers suspected of plotting attack Belgian police have arrested two men \"suspected of planning an attack\" following raids ordered by a counterterrorism judge. Authorities later released one brother, but charged the other with attempted \"terrorist murder.\" Belgian authorities charged 33-year-old Nourredine H. with attempting to commit \"terrorist murder\" on Saturday after police found evidence of an alleged plan to launch an attack in Belgium. \"Based on provisional results from the investigation, it appears that there were plans to carry out an attack somewhere in Belgium,\" the federal prosecution office said in a statement. His brother, Hamza H., was released without a charge. The police raids were on houses in Mons and Liege, both predominately French-speaking cities. They are only the latest raids in a series of counterrorism sweeps. Belgian public broadcaster RTBF reported that Nourredine H. helped make arrangements for people looking to travel to Syria in order to fight. He also made a number of contacts in France and was looking for weapons, tipping off investigators, RTBF reported. Belgium remains on high alert There was no apparent connection with the attacks at Brussels airport and the city's metro on March 22, in which 32 people were killed, the prosecution office said. Nor were weapons or explosives found in the raids ordered by the judge specializing in counterterror cases Belgian authorities last month charged two men with terrorist offenses amid reports of a planned attack on a Euro 2016 fanzone in central Brussels.

"story": "Shell sells North Sea oil fields to rival group  Royal Dutch Shell has agreed to sell 3.6 billion euros ($3.8 billion) worth of its North Sea assets to oil explorer Chrysaor as part of its debt restructuring plan aimed at adapting to lower oil prices. Ten Shell-owned oil fields in the North Sea will go to smaller rival group Chrysaor under the deal, reducing the anglo-dutch energy giant's output by over half. Some 400 employees are expected to transfer to Chrysaor. The transaction, which is still subject to regulators' approval, is slated for completion in the second half of 2017. The move is an integral part of Shell's strategy to adapt to lower oil prices and pay off debt in the wake of its massive takeover of rival BG group. \"This deal shows the clear momentum behind Shell's global, value-driven $30 billion divestment program,\" said Simon Henry, Shell's chief financial officer, adding that the \"value here represents a profit against the book values of the assets, and a breakeven oil price above that for the BG acquisition.\" Shell took over BG Group for $52.6 billion last year, increasing its proven reserves by 25 percent. Many critics questioned the logic of the move at a time when oil prices hit 12-year lows amid slowing economic growth in China and increased production in the US. Oil prices have since rebounded somewhat, with Brent crude currently back above $50 a barrel. hch/uhe (AP, DPA)",

"story": "Euroskeptic authors ask: Does Germany need therapy? In their new book, authors Hans-Olaf Henkel and Joachim Starbatty claim that by trying to save the world, Angela Merkel is ruining a country that \"belongs on the couch\" - an image that sells, but which is damaging too. \"Germany belongs on the couch!\" is the direct translation of the book written by Hans-Olaf Henkel and Joachim Starbatty, released in German as \"Deutschland geh\u00f6rt auf die Couch!\" Its subtitle provocatively states, \"Why Angela Merkel is saving the world and ruining our country.\" The authors decided to turn into Germany's psychotherapists and diagnosed it as affected by \"helper's syndrome,\" a phenomenon described by German psychoanalyst Wolfgang Schmidbauer in the 1970s. According to Schmidbauer's theory - which was never empirically proven nor picked up by the English scientific community - people affected by the \"syndrome\" have such a low self-esteem that they exaggeratedly help other people, underestimating what can be possibly achieved and often neglecting their own family to do so. Building on this model, Henkel and Starbatty claim that Germany feels so guilty about its Nazi past that it is trying to compensate by acting like Mother Teresa to try to save the world, at the expense of its own economy. Merkel's series of good-looking measures Their book starts by hitting Angela Merkel's policies - and not only because she decided to open the country's doors to refugees. She also took on a leading role against climate change and stepped up the country's planned nuclear power switch-off after the Fukushima disaster. Even though these measures could turn the country into a renewable energy trailblazer, the authors see them as economic mistakes that would rather lead Germany to become more dependent on countries where carbon emissions are not well controlled and on unsafe nuclear power plants in neighboring countries. Merkel's bailouts during the eurozone crisis are another aspect harshly criticized by Henkel, a former top manager at IBM, and Starbatty, an economist; the duo likewise plead in their book for Greece's exit from the EU. AfD's non-Islamophobic offshoot Well-known in Germany, Hans-Olaf Henkel and Joachim Starbatty are two Euroskeptic politicians who were elected Members of the European Parliament in 2014, initially belonging to the party Alternative for Deutschland (AfD). When Frauke Petry assumed leadership of the party in 2015, a move seen as a shift to the right for the party, Henkel and Starbatty were among the MEPs to leave the AfD and form a new party, called the Alliance for Progress and Renewal (ALFA). ALFA's program distances itself from the xenophobic and Islamophobic views of the AfD to focus on economic liberalism and conservative family values, topics that are also part of the populist party's program. Dealing with refugees While the refugee debate remains the dominant national issue in Germany, the AfD has been obtaining increasingly strong results in elections; it recently claimed the second-highest polling at the recent Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state election, Angela Merkel's home state. This book tackles another issue that the AfD has taken on as it explores ways to speed up the integration of refugees. The authors avoid extreme Islamophobic views even though they do mention some political and social shortcomings of Islam, such as the involvement of religious leaders in state affairs and restrictions on women's rights. They do see a direct correlation between the AfD's current popularity and Merkel's refugee policies, which they call \"catastrophic.\" Therefore, as a prescription to solve Germany's leadership problems, the therapists Henkel and Starbatty come up with a manager's solution: fire the CEO who hasn't been providing expected results. They then turn into headhunters to find the person who's in their view best qualified to replace Angela Merkel: Friedrich Merz, former CDU politician and now chairman of the board of the German operations of BlackRock, the world's largest asset management corporation. Germans also have the 'helper's syndrome' Merkel is not the only one to have Germany's \"helper's syndrome\" and to demonstrate their point, the authors add a series of miscellaneous arguments to demonstrate this. \"It was a concrete decision, we didn't want just the head, but the whole body laying on the couch,\" Henkel told DW. The authors see this as a recurring theme in Germany, but coherence is missing in their case history. One chapter focuses on the country's strong anti-TTIP position, or how Germans are trying to save the world from globalization; the next one explores how Germans are trying to save Poland's democracy. From there, Henkel and Starbatty offer some observations on Germany's \"herd journalism,\" claiming that there are few right-wing liberal voices to be heard in the country's media, and calling the controversial author and politician Thilo Sarrazin, invited to accompany the authors at their book presentation, the \"most spectacular victim of German herd journalism so far.\" Their list concludes with a chapter on how Germans are trying to save the Italian lizard, referring to environmental issues that stalled the construction of the controversial train station project, Stuttgart 21. The provocative title of their book achieved its main goal: to grab the attention of the \"herd media,\" as the room at their book presentation was filled with journalists. However, the scattered ideas of this work will fail to provide a clear remedy for the patient, who might not even be as sick as they claim. More dangerous still, it is spreading the idea that doing good and leading with progressive views is a mistake.",

"story": "UN condemns Al-Shabab attack on Somalia parliament The UN Security Council and the UN chief have condemned an attack by the Islamist group al-Shabab on the Somalia parliament, which killed at least 10. There is a report the Somali security minister has resigned. The attack by al-Shabab on Saturday at the parliament in Mogadishu involved a car bomb, a suicide bomber and gunmen. There is conflicting information as to the exact death toll. At least 10 people died, but local reports have put number at around 20, while the militants themselves have claimed 30. \"Ten government forces died and 14 others were injured in the attack today. Four lawmakers were also injured. Seven of the fighters who attacked the house were also killed,\" said police spokesman Kasim Ahmed Roble, who made no mention of civilian casualties. Witnesses said one of the dead was a soldier who tried to stop a suicide bomber from gaining access to the building. A large car bomb went off outside the gates of the parliament just before midday, while other smaller blasts and gunfire were heard coming from inside. Many MPs remained inside as the attack unfolded. Al-Shabab, a radical Islamist group that has links to al Qaeda, claimed responsibility. \"We killed 30 from the AU (African Union) and from the various forces of the so-called Somali government,\" said spokesman for the group, Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab. UN expresses outrage Senior UN officials and the UN Security Council have #link:http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47883:condemned the assault#. \"There can be no justification for such attacks,\" UN chief Ban Ki-moon said in a statement. Ban expressed his support for the lawmakers, \"who represent the people of Somalia and their aspirations for a peaceful future.\" The UN's special representative in Somalia, Nicholas Kay, gave his condolences to Somalia's Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed. The 15 member of the UN Security Council said they were \"outraged that al-Shabab has attacked the federal parliament, an institution which represents the Somali people and their legitimate hopes for peace, prosperity and stability.\" The Security Council added that the African Union's peacekeeping mission in the country would continue to receive its support. Minister 'resigns' The Somalia National Security Minister Abdikarim Hussein Gulled tendered his resignation following the attack, according to a report by news agency DPA. Gulled apparently made the announcement on state-run Radio Mogadishu, while not giving a specific reason. It is understood he had been under broader pressure over Somalia's ongoing insecurity. Al-Shabab's deadly history The group has carried out several such complex attacks in Mogadishu - among them one earlier this month on a government vehicle, an attempt on the presidential palace in February that left 16 dead, including members of the group, and assaults on a hotel that killed a dozen people in March. Government forces drove al-Shabab from the capital in 2011, but the group still controls broad areas of southern Somalia. Djibouti attack Sources in central Djibouti, a nation in the Horn of Africa, said two people were killed on Saturday in an attack on a restaurant popular with Westerners. There has been no claim of responsibility for the attack. Police are apparently investigating reports of several explosions and a suicide blast. jr/msh (dpa, AFP, Reuters)",

"story": "West strikes dangerous balance in dealings with Egypt's military Western nations led by the US appear to be hedging their bets on the true intentions of Egypt's military rulers as the crackdown in Cairo continues unabated. A fear of alternative leadership may be holding the West back. The latest street battles between demonstrators demanding the end of military rule and armed members of the security services under the command of the Supreme Council of Armed Forces (SCAF) have reopened barely healed wounds just 10 months since President Hosni Mubarak was forced out of power by similar protests. Again focusing on Cairo's Tahrir Square, the symbolic heart of the February demonstrations, protestors angered by the lack of progress since the revolution have returned once more to the streets of the capital - as well the cities of Suez and Alexandria - to call for a faster transition from military to civilian rule. While the elections scheduled for later this month would see the creation of a civilian assembly for the Egyptian parliament, ultimate control of Egypt would stay with the generals until a presidential poll, which may not happen until late 2012 or early 2013. The SCAF has made it clear that it will continue ruling until after a new constitution is created. The protestors are calling for a presidential vote no later than April. \"The SCAF represents the old military guard that propped up the Mubarak regime and its leadership is embedded within the networks of crony capitalists that are proving so hard to dislodge,\" Dr. Kristian Ulrichsen, a North Africa and Middle East expert at the London School of Economics, told Deutsche Welle. With Egypt's grip on its democratic opportunity slipping, Western powers which supported the removal of Mubarak and the popular uprising once again face decisions on how to proceed with their support - or withdraw it completely. US both condemns and supports In recent days, the administration of US President Barack Obama, which has broadly supported the SCAF while quietly pressurizing it over its slow path to reform, has urged Egypt's military rulers to increase the speed of its transition to civilian control. There is a fear in Washington that the revolution that gave most heart and impetus to the Arab Spring may be dying - and the wave of pro-democracy movements across the Arab world along with it. However, while hoping for widespread change, the White House treads a careful path. Egypt is an important US ally in the region, one which has supported the US role in the Middle East and one of the few states to maintain an uneasy peace accord with Israel. It is this strategic importance which has led Obama to reject recent calls from within Washington for the delivery of $1.3 billion (0.97 billion euros) of US aid to Egypt to be conditional on the military leadership's progress on democracy and human rights. Meanwhile, the White House is keen to strengthen ties with Egypt's newly empowered political opposition which could be the country's new power-brokers. It is a stance that sits uncomfortably with the fact that the US - as well as a number of European states - has continued to supply the SCAF with the military hardware, tear gas and rubber bullets being used against the crowds in Tahrir Square. Much the same way as it supplied over $60 billion in unconditional aid to the Egyptian military during Mubarak's 30-year reign of corruption and oppression. US double standards Some critics have accused the Obama administration of playing to Egyptian public opinion by calling for faster reforms, rather than really applying pressure on the military to stand down. Others have pointed to recent comments made by US Ambassador for Middle East Transition William Taylor in Washington last week as evidence of US double standards. \"Governing is not what the Egyptian military is trained to do,\" explained Taylor, asserting that the military crackdown can be attributed to the fact that the SCAF is unaccustomed to ruling and may be overwhelmed by the situation it finds itself in. \"Western governments should make much more clear statements that the disproportional use of force against civilian protesters contradicts any democratic standards and that the military leadership is responsible for this escalation,\" Dr. Stephan Roll, an Egypt expert with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told Deutsche Welle. Some experts believe that there are elements in the US political system which see the retention of power by the SCAF as the lesser of multiple evils and are privately supporting this out of fear of the alternative. \"The West's continuing support for the SCAF is sending irreparably damaging signals to the pro-democracy movements in Egypt and across the region,\" said Dr. Ulrichsen. \"It reinforces perceptions that the West would rather see a narrow change of elites than a thorough revolution based on ideas of equality, dignity, social justice and democracy.\" Lesser of multiple evils? Dr. Roll points to the concerns arising from a possible Islamist-led government in Egypt. \"My impression is that within the US administration - but even more so in the US Senate - there are influential voices which are totally against any 'Islamist leadership' in Egypt,\" he said. \"There is a lot of fear that the Muslim Brotherhood could be just the beginning and that Salafist forces could become part of the country's political leadership,\" he added. \"There are also a lot of personal links to the Egyptian military leadership within the US which have worked quite well over the last few decades.\" However Dr. Roll said that the Islamists, which could win 40 percent of parliamentary seats, with a big portion going to The Freedom and Justice Party of the Muslim Brothers, should not be feared if they gain power through free elections. \"The Muslim Brotherhood leadership seems to be very pragmatic and if they enjoy the confidence of the people, they should get the chance to take political responsibility.\" \"In my opinion the worst-case scenario would be that the military leadership attempts to keep the transition process unstable to keep control of developments,\" he added. \"This would be a very risky business.\" Middle East expert Dr. John Chalcroft agrees. \"If the military were allowed to stay in power, it would be a disaster; disappointing the hopes and sacrifice of the millions who sought bread, freedom and dignity promised by the Arab Spring,\" he told Deutsche Welle. \"It will set the clock back, and help reproduce a Middle East full of dictators, poverty, sectarian conflict, violent movements of opposition, and national humiliation.\" Dr. Ulrichsen believes that the worst-case scenario for the West would be if any Egyptian rebellion against a military supported by the West fuelled powerful feelings of anti-Western resentment that in turn translated into support for radical alternatives in Egypt itself. \"The Egyptian revolution was notably free of nakedly Islamist or anti-Western motivations but any second uprising might not escape this, particularly if the West came to be seen as part of the problem,\" he said.

"story": "Opinion: The biggest loser of the polls is Europe itself Europe has voted and not even half of the electorate bothered to cast their vote. That's shameful. So little commitment for the only democratically-elected institution of the European Union is alarming. The supranational parliament of 27 states is unparalleled in the world. But this unique chance doesn't seem to matter at all to most Europeans. It's not just lazy voters who are to blame for the debacle, European politicians are also largely to blame. As is normally the case, 27 national election campaigns were fought, with little evidence of any specific European election campaigns. At home politicians tend to lay into those politicians in Brussels, although they often share responsibility for decisions taken at EU level. In Eastern Europe's younger democracies the situation is even worse. There seems to be no comprehension of how important the European Parliament is in all areas of daily life. As in previous EU elections, governments are punished with only a few exceptions. The results of the European elections themselves point towards continuity. Victory for the conservative and center-right parties. The Socialists remain the second strongest force and the liberals stay the third strongest block. The Euro-sceptics and right-wing extremists might have caused uproar in a few countries, but they do not play a large role in the general make-up of the European Parliament. Even if they were to form into a parliamentary grouping, they do not have any major influence. EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso has even reason to celebrate. The conservative politician can remain in office for another five years, because it's usually the case that the Commission President comes from the same political family as the majority party represented in parliament. In the largest EU member state, Germany, it was the same story as in the rest of the EU. National topics dominated the scene. The election winners from the conservative CDU, the Left Party, the liberal FDP and the Greens declared the election a test for the federal polls in September. The election losers, the Social Democrats, though, dismiss any idea that Sunday\u2019s outcome will affect the national vote. It's the same old story after every election. But because of the exceptionally low electoral turnout it is indeed hard to make a reliable prediction for Germany's upcoming national elections. One thing's for certain: The election loser is Europe, because far too many voters are not interested in European politics. Author: Bernd Riegert Editor: Andreas Illmer",

"story": "Bonn Conference to Set Agenda for New UN Climate Deal The UN's climate chief urged industrialized countries to lead the way on controlling climate change as a new round of UN talks aimed at replacing the Kyoto Protocol got underway in Bonn on Sunday, March 29. Around 2,600 delegates from 175 countries gathered in the former German capital over the weekend for the first of several meetings ahead of December's Copenhagen summit, at which new global targets on emissions are to be set ahead of the 2012 expiry of the Kyoto agreement. The Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement on stabilizing the output of greenhouse gases, entered into force in 2005. Yvo De Boer, who heads climate change initiatives at the United Nations, said developing countries would only agree to a new climate pact if industrialized nations set clear targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases. Additionally, those nations have to be prepared to offer financial support to poorer countries. A challenge for big polluters The new agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol sets a challenge for industrialized nations, with a call for an additional target of a 25 to 40-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2020, compared to 1990 figures. By the year 2050, output is to be reduced even more, with a targeted emissions cut of 50 to 80 percent. That cut is needed to keep the overall increase in world temperatures within 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F). These targets will be haggled over in the months leading up to December's Copenhagen summit. Many industrialized nations are hoping to tweak their domestic economies as little as possible, perhaps by using compensatory projects, such as rain forest preservation, to help them meet targets. De Boer said the debate needed to move forward during the 10-day Bonn conference, as a draft proposal was needed by June in order to meet the Copenhagen deadline. \"The clock is running and the states have a great deal of work ahead,\" de Boer said. All eyes on the US The United States' position will be keenly observed in the coming days, since Washington recently changed tack on climate change with the inauguration of President Barack Obama. Former US President Bill Clinton signed the Kyoto Protocol, but it was never ratified. The White House on Saturday invited the UN and 16 major economies to Washington to prepare for international efforts to reduce climate changing greenhouse gas emissions. \"The US will be powerfully and fervently engaged in this process,\" Obama's climate negotiator, Todd Stern said on Sunday. But he cautioned against unrealistic expectations that the United States could \"wave a magic wand\" and find solutions to all problems. \"I don't think anybody should be thinking that the US can ride in on a white horse and make it all work,\" he said. The Chinese puzzle In particular, Washington wants to see China increase its commitment to emissions reduction, since the country's economic growth made it one of the biggest greenhouse gas contributors. China and the US between them account for more than 40 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. \"If you do the math, you simply cannot be anywhere near where science tells us we need to be if you don't have China involved, as well also other major developing countries,\" he said. The Kyoto protocol was lenient on developing countries such as China, India and Brazil. This is to change in the document to be signed in Copenhagen. De Boer welcomed Obama's initiative, saying it could be \"useful\" to find a political solution to the climate change talks.",

"story": "Final four square off in German Cup semifinals Bremen's unprecedented four-match battle with Hamburg gets underway with the Cup semifinal on Wednesday. But before that Leverkusen try to seize their last chance for some silverware against Mainz. Among the high hopes Leverkusen carried into this season, one is still alive. If they can get past second-division Mainz, the underachieving squad will book a place in the Cup finals in Berlin on May 30. After topping the table for parts of the first half of the season, coach Bruno Labbadia's charges have been wretched of late, winning only three of their last 10 matches and dropping down to ninth in the league. One reason is that, with their own stadium undergoing renovations, they've had to play their home matches in Duesseldorf. That's also the case with Tuesday's semifinal. Still, Leverkusen have to fancy their chances -- with no major injury problems against an opponent from Division Two. And winning the Cup would go a long way toward salvaging a disappointing season and probably save Labbadia's job. Mainz, for their part, are certain to pack defenders into their own half and hope for a late goal, a strategy that worked well in their quarterfinal upset of first-division Schalke in early March. Epic rivalry The other Cup finalist will be determined when Bremen travel to Hamburg on Wednesday. It's the first of a four-game series between the Northern German rivals -- with a UEFA Cup semifinal tie and a league match to follow later in April and in May. Bremen, who have slipped down to tenth in the Bundesliga table, have been on cruise control in the league. But it will be a different story in the two cup competitions, with titles and a spot in international competition up for grabs. Bremen goalkeeper Tim Wiese has promised his side will try to \"get on Hamburg's nerves\" and win all four matches. The visitors will be bolstered by the return of superstar playmaker Diego who was rested with a perhaps fictional injury in the league last weekend. Hamburg, meanwhile, are third in the league and have an outside shot at winning a triple. But they should beware, if they think they're bound to be victorious in something. As recently as 2002, Leverkusen had a chance to win the Bundesliga, the Cup and the Champions League -- only to emerge, in the end, empty-handed. Author: Jefferson Chase Editor: Trinity Hartman",

"story": "November sees first pan-Iberian anti-austerity strike Spanish trade unionists have called a general strike against Madrid's austerity program. The protests will coincide with a similar strike in neighboring Portugal to make it the first concerted Iberian labor action. The Spanish trade union confederation CCOO called Friday for a general strike for November 14, saying it would be directed at Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's recent austerity policies. The labor action will coincide with a general strike in neighboring Portugal, prompting organizers to speak of the first joint Iberian workers protest. \"The strike has good chances of spreading to other European countries, especially in the south,\" CCOO representative Fernando Leczano told reporters in Madrid. Leczano insisted that all EU countries that have applied austerity measures have become worse for it and said the strike in November was aimed at forcing governments to modify their economic and budgetary policies. Government not amused In a first response to the announcement, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the strike would not improve the image of his country abroad. Though he acknowledged that people are concerned about the government's harsh cuts, Rajoy insisted that the measures are required to wriggle out of recession. \"We do it because it must be done, and because it will create the basis for economic recovery,\" Rajoy said on the sidelines of an EU reform summit in Brussels. Madrid had announced the toughest budget cuts in decades in a bid to reduce public deficit from 9.4 percent of gross domestic product last year to 6.3 percent in 2012. Spain has slipped into recession for the second time in three years. The government's reforms aim to convince investors that the country can pull itself up by its bootstraps without a full-blown sovereign bailout by European lenders. hg/mkg (dpa, AP)",

"story": "Blair: \"No Point\" to Return to EU Constitution UK Prime Minister Tony Blair gave a strong hint Wednesday he will resist efforts to resurrect elements of the failed EU constitution. It could be a big step back for Angela Merkel, who wants an EU treaty passed. Speaking after talks in London with Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek, Blair said there would be no deal at the Brussels summit on June 21 and 22 unless demands for a EU constitution were set aside. It could prove a big setback to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has made getting the EU constitution back on track after defeats at the polls by the French and the Dutch a priority of Germany's EU presidency, which ends this month. Blair told a news conference in Downing Street that there would be \"real difficulties\" between some of the 27 EU members due attend. 'Amending treaty' Referring to French-German moves to resurrect aspects of the European constitution, soundly defeated in referenda in France and the Netherlands two years ago, Blair said he would sign up only to an \"amending treaty.\" \"Frankly, in order to get an agreement, the type of issues we are talking about are going to have to be satisfied,\" he said. His comments came after talks with Topolanek, who had expressed a \"similar approach\" on the issue of the constitution, Blair indicated. Blair said there was \"no point\" returning to the constitution, and added that the EU should be looking at \"smaller measures to make it more effective to the needs of countries.\" He said there was a \"real desire\" in Europe to move on from the issue of the constitution to other matters of \"huge importance,\" such as energy, migration, economic issues and defence. Sarkozy visit Earlier Wednesday, Blair's office announced that French President Nicolas Sarkozy would visit London for crucial pre-summit talks on June 19. For the first time, Blair and his successor, Gordon Brown, would be joint hosts of the meeting with Sarkozy, an advocate of a \"simplified treaty that would allow the implementation of the essential institutional advances contained in the EU constitution.\" Such efforts have been dismissed as an attempt to \"reintroduce the constitution through the back door\" by commentators in London. The Blair-Brown double act comes only days before Brown is expected to be elected Labour Party leader, followed by Blair's final departure from power on June 27. Blair's spokesman said the meeting with Sarkozy on June 19 was agreed at the recent Group of Eight (G8) summit in Germany. Sarkozy's claim that he and Blair had agreed on the \"framework\" for a revised mini-constitution has not been backed up by officials in London. \"What's important when you have got a new French president is that you get a chance to explore at greater length than is possible at a bilateral his position in the run-up to discussions at the summit,\" said Blair's official spokesman. Gordon Brown's role The meeting, with the inclusion of Brown in a \"new role,\" would therefore be \"useful from several perspectives.\" \"We have always said there will be close consultations, as there always are before a summit, between colleagues in government.

Sitting in front of the fire with a purring cat upon your lap, having a loyal dog guarding the house and family, or watching a goldfish swim around its bowl for hours on end. Having a Hausdrache (lit: house dragon) in the household is quite a different matter! A Drache is a mythical beast which spits fire, battles knights in shining armour, and steals beautiful princesses. A Hausdrache is equally unpleasant and describes a domineering housewife. \"Take your shoes off, I just cleaned the floor,\" \"don\u2019t talk with your mouth full,\" \"go and tidy your room,\" she shouts angrily.

"story": "German ISAF general calls Wikileaks document release 'a crime' Brigadier General Josef Blotz has criticized the recent online leak of 92,000 mostly classified documents on the Afghan conflict. He said the information could put soldiers and civilians in danger. A top German general and ISAF spokesman blasted the whistle-blowing 'Wikileaks' website on Thursday for last week's publication of thousands of mostly classified files on the conflict in Afghanistan. \"I take this opportunity to criticize the release of these documents,\" Brigadier General Josef Blotz said in a video conference transmitted to journalists from Afghanistan to the Bundeswehr Operations Command Center near the German city of Potsdam. \"It was extremely irresponsible and, basically, it was a crime.\" Blotz didn't directly contradict earlier military statements suggesting that the documents would have little impact on current operations because they are all at least seven months old, but he did said that they could pose a danger to individual soldiers and civilians. \"The classified material - now made available to the general public - can indeed jeopardize the lives of our ISAF troops,\" he warned from the ISAF base in the Afghan capital Kabul. \"Moreover, they can endanger the lives of many ordinary Afghans who in some way or another have cooperated with ISAF forces or Afghan security troops, and whose names are explicitly mentioned in the documents.\" However, the general also insisted that the news value contained in the files was actually very limited, saying the information released \"would only bowl over people who hadn't picked up a newspaper for the past three years.\" Armed and ready? Blotz also praised the levels of equipment provided to German troops on the ground, saying provisions had improved markedly in the past couple of years and that only a few minor shortfalls remained. The general dismissed claims from the German parliament's commissioner for Bundeswehr affairs, Helmut Koenigshaus, that the equipment levels for German soldiers had become \"a drama.\" Koenigshaus spoke of shortfalls including furniture for the barracks, camp beds, as well as live and blank ammunition, saying some troops were feeling neglected. Blotz described this assertion as \"at least completely disproportionate,\" saying that while soldiers would always like more, the situation \"in no way warrants jumping to the kind of conclusions which I have seen in the newspapers in the past few days.\" However, the criticism has become reciprocal, with Koenigshaus' Free Democrat party coming to the defense of the man charged with fighting the Bundeswehr's corner in Berlin. \"The job of commissioner for Bundeswehr affairs is anchored in our constitution; it's to address the soldiers' concerns and make them common knowledge in parliament and in public,\" Free Democrat defense expert Elke Hoff said after the video conference. \"However, it is not part of ISAF's job to publicly criticize the commissioner's important work. Our defense minister (Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg) should make this crystal clear, and should perhaps consider personal consequences.\" \"Deliberate progress\" Blotz also told reporters that the ISAF mission in Afghanistan was progressing well. Even if no major breakthroughs are currently on the horizon, he spoke of \"deliberate progress\", military terminology for piecemeal improvement, in the country. He also said the impression of a growing Taliban insurgency was somewhat artificial, because most of the attacks are sustained in highly hostile areas which the NATO-led forces didn't always patrol. \"We simply had to move into such areas, there was no alternative to it,\" Blotz said. \"And because you have more combat action now, the media often concludes that we're confronted with a Taliban offensive, but that's not the case.\" Blotz said the fighting had intensified in particular trouble-spots, with the country as a whole gradually pacifying. He pointed out that seven of every ten ISAF losses are incurred solely in the Kandahar province. In the long term, he said, the target is still to hand over security tasks to the Afghan military and police. \"Building up the Afghan security forces is without doubt the number-one priority for the ISAF command,\" he said. \"We need to be successful in this so we can prepare the withdrawal of our own troops. From what we see right now, it should be possible to complete this task by 2014, due to the remarkable progress already made in this field. However, Blotz added that the date 2014 was first floated by Afghan President Hamid Karzai, not ISAF, and also said that even after a security handover took place, some western troops would stay in Afghanistan for non-combat purposes.

"story": "Austrian foreign minister suggests 'refugees should be held offshore' Austria's foreign minister has suggested that the EU's refugees be interned offshore rather than allowed on to the continent. He said the EU should look to the Australian example of dealing with migrant entries. Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz (photo) of the rightist Austrian People's Party told a newspaper that Australia's immigration policy should be replicated by the EU in order to deal with the current influx of refugees. Migrants who try to reach Australia by boat are turned back or sent to internment camps in the Pacific Ocean countries of Nauru and Papua New Guinea where they are held indefinitely while their cases are processed. The system has been criticized by human rights groups amidst reports of rape and suicides among detainees. \"The Australian model of course cannot be completely replicated but its principles can be applied in Europe,\" Kurz, who at 29 years old is Europe's youngest minister, told Die Presse in an interview published Sunday. Australia makes zero exceptions Kurz commented that in the first half of the 20th century the United States held new arrivals on Ellis Island as they travelled to New York. In fact, Ellis Island was an immigration inspection station that processed thousands of new arrivals every day. Immigrants were only held in the station's infirmaries if they were suspected of carrying infectious diseases but otherwise were not interned, as the minister suggested. But in an apparent attempt to stake out a tough approach to refugees, Kurz told the newspaper that the EU should adopt a resolution whereby those who try to enter Europe illegally lose their right to demand asylum. Far-right parties have made sweeping gains in recent Austrian elections. Austria, governed by a coalition of social-democrats and conservatives, allowed some 90,000 asylum seekers to enter the Alpine country last year. But Vienna has since hardened its conditions of asylum and tried to close the migrant route from Greece to the north of Europe via the Balkans. At least 204,000 migrants and refugees have crossed the Mediterranean to Europe since January, the United Nations refugee agency said this week. More than 2,500 people have died trying to make the sea crossing as Europe faces the largest wave of migration since World War II. jar/jm (AFP)",

"story": "Open EU to African goods, German development minister says Completely opening up the EU market to African goods would help reduce migration, German Development Minister Gerd M\u00fcller has said. In particular, he wants barriers to agricultural trade taken down.   The European Union should completely open its market to products from Africa in order to promote development and stem migration flows, German Development Minister Gerd M\u00fcller said Wednesday. \"Open the market for all African goods,\" he told Die Welt newspaper in an interview. Read more: African countries agree to continental free trade area Agricultural products from Africa must be able to enter the EU without tariffs and quotas in order to provide work for millions of people on the continent, M\u00fcller said. The EU currently has separate trade agreements with African countries or regional economic blocs. In addition to tariffs and quotas, agricultural products face a hurdle being exported due to the EU's strict sanitary and phytosanitary standards. M\u00fcller also suggested that as part of an agreement with the EU, African countries should take back migrants who entered the bloc without proper approval. In return, the EU should open up avenues for Africans to come to the EU for legal employment. Only around 1,000 out of 3.5 million German companies are active in Africa, M\u00fcller said, highlighting the massive potential in the continent of 1.2 billion people. On the other hand, China, Russia and Turkey have aggressively entered the Africa market. Read more: Africa needs unified regulations against cheap Chinese imports Support from coalition, farmers M\u00fcller, a member of the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), received support for his ideas from the Social Democrats (SPD). SPD agriculture spokesperson Bernd Westphal told the daily Berliner Zeitung on Thursday that opening the EU's agriculture markets would improve employment prospects in Africa and reduce migration pressures. Read more: Undocumented African migration to Germany: What can and should be done The German Farmers Association also supported the idea of duty- and quota-free African agriculture exports to the EU. At the same time, the association's general secretary, Bernhard Kr\u00fcsken, said processed and value-added agriculture products should be encouraged because they provide more employment and wealth creation. EU Africa Commissioner M\u00fcller also called for a new EU Africa commissioner position to be created to coordinate and expand policy towards the continent. In addition, at the EU level more money should be spent implementing the bloc's Africa policy, he said. cw/sms (AFP, dpa)",

"story": "Three key points about Argentina: a sputtering favorite Argentina may have a perfect record at this year's World Cup, but their game has been anything but perfect. There are good reasons why the Gauchos are just barely getting the job done. Barca and Real a difficult mix You can divide up Argentina's torturous 1-0 win over Switzerland on Tuesday into three distinct phases. In the first half, the Gauchos tried to play a short passing game reminiscent of Barcelona, only with Lionel Messi in the role of playmaker, not forward. That didn't work at all. In the second half, Argentina reverted to medium-distance crosses aimed at Real's Gonzalo Higuain. That worked somewhat better, although their best chance came after a Messi solo. Then in the dying minutes of extra time, \"The Messiah\" alertly pounced on an errant pass and fed Real's Angel di Maria for the out-of-the-blue game-winner. In terms of individual quality, it was a potent demonstration of what can result when players from the two great Spanish rivals hook up. Unfortunately, for the Gauchos, it was just one moment. For Argentina to live up to their status as favorites, they will have to harmonize better as a team. Otherwise they will continue to struggle against switched-on defenses like Switzerland's. Uncertainty between the posts Against Switzerland, Argentina were just a few minutes away from a penalty shootout. You wouldn't have bet on Albiceleste, if it had come to spot kicks. As loaded with intoxicating talent as the squad is, Argentina's goalkeepers are hardly top-shelf material. Sergio Romero isn't even the number one keeper for his club AS Monaco, and despite keeping two clean sheets in this World Cup, his international performances have hardly been unblemished. In Argentina's match with Germany at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, he had to fish the ball out of his net four times. And as if to remind fans of his vulnerability, early in the second half against Switzerland Romero contrived to bobble the ball four times within seconds and almost ended up with it in his hands outside the area. Argentina would be well advised to not let games get to penalty shootouts. Rojo a no show In their quarter-final, Argentina are going to be without one of their few players to unequiviocally exceed expectations. Sporting Lisbon's 24-year-old left-back Marcos Rojo has been a standout performer at this most difficult position, not only locking down his side of the defense but getting forward at key times as well. Rojo forced Argentina's first goal of this World Cup - an own goal by Bosnia-Herzegovina's Sead Kolasinac. And he scored the game-winner in the Gauchos' 3-2 win over Nigeria in the group stage. Rojo now has an involuntary day off after picking up a second yellow card. The men who replaced Rojo when he was substituted off in minute 105 against Switzerland, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Basanta, is a 30-year-old center back who played his club football for Monterrey in Mexico. Rojo's absence could reveal a fatal lack of depth at Argentina's back.",

"story": "Unnecessary protection? YouTube's 'LGBT filter' YouTube's \"restricted\" mode aims to keep children and young people from seeing inappropriate content. But harmless videos by members of the LGBT community are also being blocked.   The British video blogger Rowan Ellis was one of the first to notice the problem. If you scroll down to the bottom of a page on YouTube and click on \"restricted mode,\" lots of videos dealing with gay, lesbian, bi- or transsexual issues are no longer visible. \"In that mode, there are 40 of my videos you can't see,\" she says. These include a video she made with her father in which he gives tips to other parents on how to support their lesbian, gay, bi- or transsexual child. YouTube introduced the \"restricted\" function in 2010. The company says it's intended primarily as an aid for institutions such as schools to help them control content. YouTube said in an official statement that, once the mode is activated, videos that are obscene or violent or deal with \"certain illnesses such as addiction or eating disorders\" should no longer be searchable. And it works - rather too well, unfortunately. Many videos labeled with the keywords \"gay,\" \"lesbian,\" \"transsexual\" or \"bisexual\" are also categorized as \"possibly inappropriate\" when the user is in restricted mode. Or, to put it another way: They can't be viewed. Only seven videos not blocked The German non-profit organization queerblick e.V. is among those affected. Only seven out of a total of 462 videos on the organization's channel are still available once the restricted mode has been activated. YouTube's algorithm evaluates as \"possibly inappropriate\" videos with titles such as \"Coming out as trans,\" \"Nic tells his story,\" or \"Pickled cucumbers and a liter of milk \u2013 Michelle on the interview couch.\" Paul Klammer, co-founder of the organization and a member of its board, only realized what was happening once the debate had kicked off in the US and Britain. \"It is quite a blow,\" he told DW. As for what makes the seven unblocked videos different from the other 455, he really couldn't say. Klammer, a science journalist, founded the organization in 2009 along with a couple of friends, with the aim of offering other young people some authentic role models. At the time, the number of LGBT videos available online was very limited, and co-founder Falk Steinborn, also a journalist and a media trainer, established as part of his PhD research that young LGBT people wished there were more videos online that addressed themes relevant to them. Honored by the Family Ministry - blocked by YouTube Their YouTube channel now has almost 38,000 subscribers, and the project has received numerous awards, most recently from the German Ministry for Family Affairs. The videos the organization publishes on its YouTube channel are all made under the guidance of professional media trainers. \"The videos address the worries and needs of young people that age, particularly people who are gay, lesbian, bi- or transexual,\" says Paul Klammer. The organization also broadcasts its videos on German television, on the local educational channel nrwision. However, as Klammer explains, YouTube is much more important when it comes to getting them out to a wider audience. YouTuber Rowan Ellis also emphasizes the importance of YouTube for people who are confused about their sexual identity. \"There are a lot of people, both young and old, who are very afraid and don't feel at home in their bodies. These people have often been helped by online videos, because they couldn't talk about it to anyone,\" Ellis told DW. Apology from YouTube Some 23,500 people have subscribed to Ellis's channel, and in Britain she's an official YouTube ambassador. \"I know they do take the issue of diversity seriously; a lot of people in the company have done a lot in this area,\" she says. However, it makes her furious that her videos have been blocked, yet at the same time extremely insulting comments are publicly visible underneath them when the filter is deactivated. \"I had to ask 10 guest moderators to help me as I couldn't get through the comments fast enough,\" she says. So far, the company has made hardly any comment. There was just one short blog entry on a blog aimed specifically at YouTube producers. In response to an enquiry from DW, the parent company, Google, confirmed that there have been no other statements on the subject so far. In the statement, YouTube admits that the function isn't working as it's supposed to: \"We're sorry, and we'll put that right,\" it said. However, several days have passed since that announcement and nothing has happened. The company has just removed a few selected videos from the restricted mode filter bubble. Hashtag: The YouTubeIsOverParty YouTube has said that only 1.5 percent of the videos watched on the channel are viewed in restricted mode \u2013 but that they understand this is \"a matter of principle.\" However, for YouTuber Rowan Ellis and many other users this admission is not enough. They've initiated the Twitter hashtag #YouTubeIsOverParty to call on people to work together to set up a new platform. Because, as Ellis points out, there isn't really an alternative to YouTube. \"It's not intended as a call for a boycott; it's more of a symbolic appeal,\" she says. \"And we'll keep saying it loud until YouTube makes some changes.\" Paul Klammer and his organization queerblick also say they don't want to take any action on this for the time being. \"YouTube is the platform that made LGBT bloggers and producers big in the first place, and it's always supported them,\" he said. Nonetheless, he too is demanding that the filter be revised: \"LGBT people are a part of the world we live in - whether or not they're ignored online.\"",

"story": "Heaven's Meadow - The Small Wonders of Baan Gerda A German former executive turns a dream into reality, using donated funding to build a village for HIV-infected orphans. The global death rate is mounting rapidly for HIV-infected children and teenagers, many of them AIDS orphans. On June, 27, 2007, DW-TV will be airing a documentary on this important topic and at the same time presenting an extraordinary project: \"Heaven's Meadow - The Small Wonders of Baan Gerda\", by Detlev F. Neufert, a film-maker in Berlin. In 2002, former Henkel executive Karl Morsbach and his wife Tassanee started a project intended to help AIDS orphans live with dignity for the time alloted to them. Many of them had been turned out of their home communities and were already resigned to their fate. But then something unexpected happened: the children lived. Now Baan Gerda is a thriving village in Thailand. The Morsbachs follow the principle that only a child who's happy has a chance of recovery. They found loving surrogate parents for the AIDS orphans and built a village for them to live in. The mothers and fathers are also HIV-positive and have found a new meaning for lives in their new roles. Since 2002, nine residences, a small hospital, a \"star house\" with a large kitchen, a playground and a guest house have been built in Baan Gerda. Altogether, they make up a loving and well-maintained environment where both children and adults fighting AIDS can live in safety and security. Baan Gerda, or \"Gerdas Village\", named after Karl Morsbach's mother, can stand as an example internationally. It demonstrates how AIDS orphans can live as normal, well-looked-after children with comparatively little expense and lots of love. This documentary was started on a loan of 3000 euros, and a third of its budget was covered by sponsors, making this production a little miracle in itself. It took a total of 26 months to make. Film-maker Detlev F. Neufert: \"The 'Baan Gerda' project can help save the lives of AIDS orphans. The documentary serves as their ambassador.\"",

"story": "Violent crimes against women in India becoming a political issue The rising number of incidents of rape in Uttar Pradesh has alarmed people and politicians. A total of 10 incidents of rapes have been reported from various parts of the state over the past three days. Growing incidents of rape in India's most populous state Uttar Pradesh has started becoming a political issue. In two cases, one victim was gang-raped and burnt alive, while another had her eyes gouged out after resisting her attackers. Chief Minister Mayawati, who is in the line of fire, has assured that strict action will be taken against the perpetrators of crimes against women. The opposition political parties have accused her of being unable to protect women. Taking cognisance of rape cases in different districts of Uttar Pradesh, the Indian State Human Rights Commission has sought a reply from the government and the police. The brutal attacks against women and incidents of rape come as a blow to the image of law and order in Uttar Pradesh, especially considering that several cases of ruthless violence against women have been reported in such a short span of time. Strict action Breaking her silence over the spree of rape cases in the state, Chief Minister Mayawati has assured strict action against the culprits but also accused the opposition of politicizing the issue. She has also sought amendments to laws to ensure speedy rape trials and stricter provisions for giving bail to the accused. \"I would appeal to all opposition parties to rise above party lines and give up playing politics in the name of serious and sensitive issues like crimes against women,\" Mayawati said in a statement, adding: \"All the opposition parties have to ensure that in this atmosphere they should not play politics and must create a climate in which such incidents cease to happen anymore.\" Mayawati, who heads her own regional party, the Bahujan Samaj Party, has recently been embroiled in a series of heated differences with the ruling Congress Party which insists she has lost the moral authority to rule the state. Elections Uttar Pradesh is due to elect its new legislative assembly next year, which is seen as crucial since the state elects the maximum 80 members in the 543-member Lok Sabha or Lower House of parliament. Ranjana Kumari, director of the Centre for Social Research, which has organized a fact-finding mission, is shocked by the incidents and calls the 10 rapes in 48 hours \"absolutely abnormal\" and \"deplorable.\" She says the attacks on the young girls have not been limited to rape, \"they have been murdered, they have been blinded, it is a totally unacceptable situation that is going on in UP [Uttar Pradesh].\" Senior Congress leaders have been especially vocal accusing Mayawati of ignoring the plight of women, especially those living in the rural hinterland. Ritu Bahugana is the president of the state\u2019s Congress unit. She says she was put in jail for pointing out the serious deterioration of the situation of women. \"From the very month this chief minister took over, there has been a serious deterioration of women in UP especially relating to crime. Now things have come to a position of no return. You see there is no fear and everyday issues are being highlighted,\" says Bahugana. 'Anti-social elements at large' The fresh spate of attacks has shifted focus on the state government's inability to ensure the safety of women. Kumari says it \"almost looks like all anti-social elements in UP are at large and some kind of a failure of the state. Normally one would think that a women chief minister that represents underprivileged sections, who has been known for a strong administration, that she has put a lot of emphasis on law and order \u2013 [but she] is failing!\" For now, Mayawati is walking the tight rope and hopes her government can establish a process for law and order in the violent state.

"story": "Mbeki Received Millions in German Defense Deal, Report Says South African President Thabo Mbeki allegedly took a multimillion-dollar bribe from a German shipbuilding giant in return for a 1999 submarine deal, a South African paper has reported. South Africa's Sunday Times presented the findings of what it said was a six-month investigation which showed that the company, identified as MAN Ferrostaal, had allegedly paid 30 million rands ($4.1 million) to Mbeki to guarantee it would receive the hotly-sought contract. Mbeki vehemently denied the allegation. \"The presidency would like to place it on record that President Thabo Mbeki has never at any stage received any amount of money from MAN Ferrostaal,\" a statement from his office said. Both Mbeki and Zuma bribed? The Sunday Times quoted a secret report compiled in 2007 by a British consultant, commissioned by an unnamed Central European manufacturer to investigate MAN Ferrostaal, which had launched a hostile takeover bid against it. According to The Times, Mbeki gave 2 million rands of the money to current Vice President Jacob Zuma and the rest to the ruling party, the African National Congress. The report was published as Zuma faces a fraud and corruption trial in connection with allegedly taking of bribes from arms dealers. Court proceedings are expected to take place this month. The statement from Mbeki's office called the newspaper report nothing \"but a hotchpotch recycling of allegations that have from time been peddled against the government's strategic defense procurement package. \"This time, the Sunday Times outdoes itself by placing a spurious allegation in the public domain, i.e. President Thabo Mbeki received a bribe of 30 million rands from MAN Ferrostaal,\" it said. ThyssenKrupp under investigation In a separate 1994 South African deal to purchase four German-made warships, or corvettes, German prosecutors are also investigating alleged kickbacks for South African officials. The company in question, ThyssenKrupp, part of a German consortium that produced the corvettes, confirmed in April that they had paid an African intermediary $22 million for \"the usual commissions\" but said they had declared it in their contract and there was no evidence of corruption. In that deal, the post-apartheid government in South Africa decided in 1994 to buy new warships, but the German consortium was scratched from the five-country shortlist of suppliers in December of that year. By that point, only British and Spanish suppliers were left in the race. But four weeks later, the Germans suddenly came back onto the shortlist, with then-vice president Mbeki announcing during a visit by a German minister and businessman that the issue was wide open. The Germans then moved to the front in a complicated tendering procedure and an order for the four warships was signed on December 3, 1999. The decision was criticized in South Africa, with an inquiry concluding in 2001 that the Germans should have been eliminated in the first round for failing to meet several requirements, according to German news weekly, Der Spiegel, in April.",

"story": "Estonian couple arrested for giving secrets to Russia A husband and wife duo was arrested in Estonia under suspicion of delivering state secrets to Russia over a period of several years. A man who worked for many years in Estonia's security police was arrested along with his wife on Wednesday for allegedly turning over state secrets to Russia. Aleksei and Viktoria Dressen were arrested at Tallinn Airport as they prepared to board a flight for Moscow. Aleksei Dressen has worked in Estonia's counter-espionage and anti-terrorism force for nearly 20 years. As a member of the security police, Dressen had access to state secrets, but prosecutors did not say what those may have been. \"Dressen is suspected of collecting classified information for years and was caught with evidence,\" state prosecutor Norman Aas told reporters in the capital Tallinn. \"His wife was also arrested Wednesday morning at Tallinn airport as the couple planned to board a Tallinn-Moscow flight.\" Dressen's wife does not work for the government but allegedly acted as a courier, brining classified documents to agents with the Russian security agency, the FSB. According to prosecutors, the 44-year-old Aleksei Dressen could face a prison sentence of three to 15 years in prison if found guilty of treason. Tensions between Russia and the former Soviet satellite are tense. After gaining its independence in 1991 following 50 years of rule from Moscow, Estonia joined the European Union and NATO in 2004. In 2009, Estonian Herman Simm was convicted of treason and sentenced to twelve and a half years in prison for selling NATO secrets to Russia. mz/acb (AP, Reuters, AFP)",

"story": "Russian experts open black box of jet downed by Turkey Moscow has begun examining the contents of the black box from the jet that was shot down by Turkey last month. Ankara said the Russian Su-24 jet was violating its airspace. Technicians in Moscow used screwdrivers, drills and vacuum cleaners to open the black box on Friday, as diplomats from Britain, India and China witnessed the procedure that was broadcast on state television. Fourteen countries were invited to observe the investigation, Sergei Dronov, deputy chief of the Russian air force, told journalists. \"We have sufficient evidence that proves that the Russian aircraft did not violate Turkish airspace,\" Dronov said, adding that the warplane had been flying in Syrian airspace and within 5.5 kilometers (three miles) of the Turkish border. Results of the examination would be revealed on December 21, he announced. Russian officials retrieved the black box after Syria's special forces \"liberated\" rebel-held territory where the warplane was shot down by Turkey, Russia's Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said earlier this month. Russian President Vladimir Putin also said the black box would help reveal the exact position of the flight and where it was downed. Ankara said the Russian plane strayed into its territory despite repeated warnings, but Moscow maintains that the jet did not cross the Syrian border with Turkey. Russia accused Turkey of provoking it deliberately and described the event as a \"stab in the back.\" Putin also said it was \"practically impossible\" to overcome tensions with Ankara after this event. mg/sms (AP, AFP)",

"story": "Opinion: So much for a 'lame duck,' Obama's State of the Union In his State of the Union address, US President Barack Obama confidently defied Republican leaders. Obama wants to give his policies one last push, says DW's Gero Schlie\u00df. That was not the voice of a loser. It was the voice of a winner. Forget the Republicans, take no notice of them, they have given you nothing. The calls of many of the Democrats fearing an electoral defeat sounded almost like pleas to their president. But President Barack Obama didn't have to be told twice. The fact that his party had just suffered a crushing defeat in the midterm elections and had to address a completely Republican-controlled Congress for the first time seemed to be anything but a challenge for the US president. A reinvigorated Barack Obama was bursting with power, self-confident, and aggressive during his address to Congress. Taking Republicans into consideration was the last thing on his mind. With great gusto, he issued almost half a dozen veto threats - from the Republicans fight against the Obamacare health care reforms, to demands for further sanctions against Iran. Obama's message was clear: The United States has wandered through the valley of tears and is on top again. The economy is growing at record speed, unemployment is on the decline, prices on Wall Street are rising and oil prices are lower than they've been for some time - all factors which masses of people are set to profit from. But first, it's the president who's reaping the rewards. Obama is suddenly popular again. The good news has catapulted his popularity figures. Obama was in high spirits. He's pushing through his agenda - one could even say the left populist agenda of his party - more for the middle class, less for the rich. Whether it's taxes, education or social benefits, when it comes to Obama, it should be the middle and lower income groups who profit - and at the expense of the wealthy and the super-rich. Obama was in his element. You could almost feel an inner liberation. This president doesn't have much to lose anymore, certainly not after the defeat at the midterm elections. Instead, his party has so much to win - namely the 2016 presidential election. Although Obama can't run for presidency again himself, he wants to make sure that the next president - possibly even the first female president - is once again a Democrat and can continue his political legacy. In his speech, Obama did everything he could to lay the groundwork for a Democrat win in 2016 and to a certain extent used his address as a springboard into the election campaign. Obama's tax initiative is the spearhead of this strategy. Higher taxes on capital gains and inheritance - these are issues typically seen to affect traditional Republicans. Tax cuts for the middle class and social achievements, such as the American version of Germany's family allowance, however, are all factors which appeal to the middle class and lower income groups, who traditionally vote for Democrats. Few people expect any of these proposals to be implemented in Obama's remaining time in office. The Republicans have already expressed their resistance. But a theme for the looming election campaign has been set and the Republicans will have their work cut out in explaining why they're against tax relief. What Obama has put in motion with executive orders on immigration policy, climate protection or most recently with the historical rapprochement with Cuba, far exceeds the tailored package of tax relief and social benefits for the middle class. But that's not enough for election campaigning. That's where his initiatives for cyber security, a free Internet or a Pacific free trade agreement come into play. In his speech, the president was even good in areas which usually highlight his weaknesses, namely foreign policy. He combined his plea for a continued fight against Islamist terror with an address of solidarity with France and all countries that have been hit by terrorist attacks. His hesitation in dealing with Syria and Russian President Vladimir Putin has been forgotten. Obama could even turn those issues into victories for deliberate, measured diplomacy. In his remaining two years in office, Obama wants to give it a try one last time. There's a chance American politics are about to get exciting. But that doesn't mean that he will lose sight of all the challenges and conflict around him. The world, whether friend or foe, can prepare for a president who will remain faithful to his foreign policy agenda until the end of his term.",

"story": "FAO: World food prices 'stabilizing at high level' The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has registered the first drop in global food prices in April after months of increases. Record crops this year are expected to meet rising global food demand. World food prices were stabilizing at a \"relatively high level\" in April, after they had been steadily rising in the first three months of the year, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said Thursday. FAO's Food Outlook - a twice-yearly global market analysis - said food prices fell by 1.4 percent from March to April this year, driving down the organization's Food Price Index to 214 points from 217 points registered in the previous month. The FAO index measures monthly price changes for a food basket containing cereals, oilseeds, dairy products sugar and meat. \"Although the index is significantly down from its record level of 235 points in April 2011, it is still well above the figures of under 200 which preceded the 2008 food crisis,\" FAO said in a statement. In its forecast for the coming 12 month, FAO predicts generally higher food supplies, but also rising demand for various agricultural produce. Unstable prices The FAO wouldn't rule out that in spite of expected record crops for the 2012/2013 harvest season, prices could rise again because strong demand would fall on low initial stocks. While 2012 cereals production was forecast to reach a new record with 2.37 billion tons, wheat production - a part of the cereals sector - is expected to fall 3.6 percent due to large declines in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, China, Morocco and the EU, the FAO report said. In addition, global soybean prices, which are already at their highest since July 2008, are likely to \"rise further\" as a result of tight supplies on the back of \"continuous purchases\" from the world's biggest buyer China, FAO analyst Abdolreza Abbassian told Reuters news agency. Abbassian added that further support for higher soybean prices would come from a 9.5 percent drop in output predicted for 2012 as soybeans would have to compete with maize for cropland especially in the United States. The FAO reports said that higher prices in the coming months were also due for oil crops and derived products which had been rising since the beginning of the year, facing an \"increasingly tight\" supply and demand situation. Steady or even falling prices the FAO predicts for rice, sugar and meat production as well as for milk and fishery products - sectors which are all in for substantial production growth in the coming months. uhe/gb (dpa, Reuters)",

"story": "Hoping for Amicable Chinese Textile Deal Germany will act \"in solidarity\" with its European partners in the trade row with China over cheap textile imports, but Berlin is hoping that an amicable deal can be reached, the German economy minister said Friday. \"We understand and accept the interests of the other countries,\" such as Spain, Portugal, Greece and France, German Economy Minister Wolfgang Clement told the news agency DPA in an interview. But the row should not be allowed to \"harm the German clothing sector,\" he added. Germany was affected only indirectly by the sharp increase in textile imports from China since the beginning of the year, Clement said. The German textiles industry, which currently employs around 140,000 people, had already undergone the necessary restructuring to face up to increase competition from low-wage countries, he added. EU restrictions This week, the European Union announced that it would put restrictions on imports of T-shirts and flax yarn from China. But compared with the measures being considered in the US, countries such as France believe that the offensives proposed by EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson did not go far enough. The US slapped import quotas on three categories of Chinese textile goods last week and added another four on Wednesday. That provoked a stiff response from China which said the action undercut the very principles of free trade being promoted by Washington and Brussels. Conciliatory gesture from Beijing Facing the threat of EU limits on Chinese textiles imports, Beijing made a conciliatory gesture and announced it would raise export tariffs on 74 categories of textile products from June 1. The ministry of finance said on its Web site that the 74 categories were among 148 products on which tariffs had already been placed at the end of the decades-long global textile export quota system on Jan. 1. It also announced export tariffs on flax yarn. Virtually all the products affected are exported to the US and EU. The China National Textile Industry Council said the move proved China was a responsible member of the international community. \"China's is a responsible country and it is for the purpose of helping establish a new world textile trade order and ease the trade friction that the government made the concession,\" spokesman Sun Huaibin told Xinhua news agency. EU: Wait and see \"This is something that we have to see more precisely from the Chinese,\" European Commission spokewoman Francoise Le Bail said. The issue would be discussed when the Chinese negotiator on textiles comes to Brussels next week to see Mandelson, she added. \"We will clarify with the Chinese what they intend to do, to have precision on this aspect of things. And also we will discuss with them the measures that we have proposed on a number of categories of products,\" Le Bail said.",

"story": "Libyan militias clash in Tripoli Rival armed groups battled in a central area of Tripoli, setting fire to a former intelligence building. The clash is one of the worst breakdowns in security in the capital since Moammar Gadhafi\u2019s fall in 2011. Armed men sealed off roads near Zawiyah Street, which was at the heart of the battle between two rival groups, residents said. \"Five people have sustained gunshot wounds in these clashes,\" a medical official at Zawiyah Street Medical Center said, adding that there had been no fatalities. Night-time clashes between rival groups are not unusual in the capital, which is still saturated with arms left over from the 2011 conflict that brought to an end Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's 42-year rule. The violence underscored the challenge faced by Libya's new government in controlling militias that gained power during the conflict. By early afternoon, a building belonging to the Supreme Security Committee (SSC), which was set up last year to try to regulate armed groups, was in flames and being looted by members of a rival militia, witnesses said. The head of the SSC, Mohammed Suweysi, said one of the militias attacked the other, accusing its members of detaining a man from their neighborhood and beating him to death. \"We called the police early in the morning to help us stop the shooting, but no one came,\" resident Khaled Mohamed told Reuters. After more than 12 hours, the army moved in to restore order. On Sunday, violence also erupted outside the capital, where a car bomb exploded in front of a police station in Benghazi. Injuring three police officers, the incident is the latest in a series of attacks on security officials in Libya's second largest city, where the US ambassador was killed in September. hc/rc (Reuters, AFP, AP)",

"story": "Gunman kills three in shooting at South Korean store Police in South Korea say a gunman killed three people at a convenience store then set it on fire before fleeing. He was later found dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Authorities say the man shot and killed a 74-year-old man and his 50-year-old son connected to the store's owners, as well as another 52-year-old man, in the attack on Wednesday. The shop is located in Sejong City, around 120 kilometers (75 miles) from the South Korean capital Seoul. Many of the country's government offices are located in the area. In a news conference, the head of the Sejong Police Agency, Lee Ja-ha, stated that the 50-year-old gunman's body was discovered on a nearby riverbank, in an apparent suicide. One shotgun was found on the man, and another in his car. Lee described the attack as \"a pre-meditated crime caused by a combination of spurned affection and a row over how to divide property.\" The daughter of the eldest victim told police she had been living with the gunman before ending the relationship around 18 months ago. They had recently fought over financial issues, with him claiming he had a stake in the store. The woman had since moved in with the 52-year-old victim. She was not present at the time of the shootings. The assailant had taken the guns from a police station in the nearby city of Gongju in central South Korea, about two hours before the shooting took place. South Korean citizens can acquire licenses for weapons used to hunt animals, but these must be stored in police stations during the off-season. Lee confirmed that the shotguns used in the killings belonged to the man, who had obtained the required licenses for them last year. Sejong police said the suspect shot the son as he sat in a car in front of the store, then went into a house next door and killed the father. Once he entered the store he gunned down the other man before pouring paint thinner on the floor, and setting it alight. The Asian nation's level of gun crime is extremely low, with strict laws around gun possession. Wednesday's shootings received wide coverage across news agencies nationwide. In recent years there have been several shooting deaths among soldiers, including an incident in June last year where five members of one unit were killed and seven wounded, in an attack near the border with North Korea. Under South Korean law all men have to serve two years in the military. an/sms (AP, AFP, DPA)",

"story": "Germany to Send Intelligence Agents to India to Aid Terror Fight Germany plans to send intelligence agents to India as part of efforts to step up cooperation in the fight against terrorism, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said Friday, Dec. 12. The two countries wanted to improve the exchange of information, the minister said after talks with Home Affairs Minister P Chidambaram and national security adviser MK Narayanan in New Delhi. Schaeuble said he had asked Indian authorities to allow Germany's anti-terrorism unit GSG 9 to make an intensive inspection of the scenes of last month's terrorist attacks in Mumbai. Germany would be prepared to help India in the fight against terrorist in any way it could, the minister said. Schaeuble said the Pakistan militant Lashkar-e-Taiba, which has been blamed for the attacks in Mumbai, had members in Germany, although the group had no organizational infrastructure there. The minister said there were no indications the group was plotting to target Germany despite \"obvious links\" to the Islamic Jihad Union, an Uzbek group accused of planning attacks on German soil. India has accused Pakistan of being behind the Mumbai bloodbath, which left more than 170 dead. The aim of the terrorists was to provoke India and increase tension with Pakistan, Schaeuble said. Internet terrorists an integral part of network In other security developments, Germany's prosecutor general said that Islamists who post fierce messages on the internet along with bomb-making instructions are becoming a key part of international terrorism. The internet served as a means of communications between different terrorist groups and as a source of information on how to mount attacks, Monika Harms said in Karlsruhe. \"The internet has become the home handyman store for the do-it-yourself terrorist,\" said Harms at a news conference. \"The desk man in front of a personal computer has become an essential component of the global jihad,\" she said, referring to the Arabic term for \"struggle.\" She said this had been proven with a trio of men detained in Germany earlier this year on suspicion of planning bombings.

"story": "Romney wins Washington in long slog for Republican nomination Businessman and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney has won Washington state, another stepping stone in the Republicans' search for a candidate to face off against US President Obama in the November election. Republican primary presidential contender Mitt Romney won Washington state's caucuses, giving the former Massachusetts governor renewed momentum in the run up to the 10 primary contests being held across the US on Tuesday. \"I'm heartened to have won the Washington caucuses, and I thank the voters for their support today,\" Romney said in a posting on Twitter and Facebook, after US broadcasters CNN, ABC and CBS projected him the winner. He took 37 percent, leading the other Republican contenders by double digits with 93 percent of the vote counted. Texas Congressman Ron Paul and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum were in a virtual dead heat for second place with 25 and 24 percent respectively, while former House speaker Newt Gingrich trailed with 11 percent. In addition to Washington state, Romney bagged wins in Michigan, Arizona and Wyoming this week. In a volatile primary race, the former governor has won six states overall, compared to four victories for Santorum and one for Gingrich. Paul has not won a state yet. The four candidates are battling to clinch the Republican nomination and face off against President Barack Obama in November. The candidates now head into so-called Super Tuesday, in which 10 states are holding primary contests, with 400 delegates up for grabs. In order to win the Republican nomination, a candidate has to secure 1,144 delegates. Romney currently has 150 delegates, while his closest rival, Santorum, has 70. There were 40 delegates at stake in the Washington caucuses. slk, ncy/ai (AP, Reuters, AFP)",

"story": "Hungry For Success, Indian Students Give Deutsch a Try In India, Germany's language and culture institute, the Goethe Institute, is flooded with students wanting to learn a foreign tongue to improve their chances of success in a globalizing world. Outside the walls of the whitewashed building located on a busy thoroughfare in New Delhi, two young grubby boys dressed in rags collect anything they can lay their hands on. The idea is to sell it at the recycling center to earn a few rupees. Inside, the air conditioning hums, converting the Indian capital's brutal summer heat of 40 degrees Celsius (104 F) and more into a bearable 25 degrees Celsius. A large green 'G' hung over the entrance doors gives away the identity of the building's occupant. But that's only half the story in this part of the world. India remains the only country where the Goethe Institute -- Germany's premier language and culture institute which has branches across the globe -- is called the Max M\u00fcller Bhavan or Max M\u00fcller House said Stefan Dreyer, head of Delhi's Goethe Institut. \"We have both. Max M\u00fcller doesn't stand against Goethe, rather it all goes with Goethe.\" With Max M\u00fcller's blessings Born in 1823 in Dessau, Max M\u00fcller was one of the first scholars to research the Indian classical language, Sanskrit and is considered the father of modern Indology. He died in Oxford in 1900. \"Goethe means a lot to Indians today,\" said Dreyer. \"But of course it's a homage to India when the institute's name symbolizes the relationship to this country. In this case, it's represented by Max M\u00fcller.\" India of course has changed unrecognizably since Max M\u00fcller's writings on the Vedic culture of India. Along with China, the South Asian giant is at the center of a major Asian economic boom. The country's economy has averaged growth rates of over seven percent in the past decade. India is home to a growing, well-educated middle class that's thirsting for knowledge and success. Stefan Dreyer said the massive economic and social changes sweeping the country are felt deeply by the Goethe Institute too. \"The motivation to learn German has changed sharply over the past years,\" said Dreyer. Until 7 to 10 years ago, Indians would choose to learn German to be able to read intellectuals such as Kant, Brecht, Grass or Goethe in the original, Dreyer pointed out. \"Today things are totally different. We have many young people who want to learn German because they want to use it to boost their chances of success in their professions,\" Dreyer said. Language as a weapon India is home to six Goethe institutes or Max M\u00fcller Bhavans. More are planned. The demand for German language courses is skyrocketing and the institute is having a tough time meeting it. At the Goethe Institut in Delhi alone, 2,200 students pass through its doors every year. Ranjan, a 34-year-old who works for an insurance company, has been learning German for the past three years -- for purely pragmatic reasons. \"I thought if I combine a foreign language with my insurance skills then I would have better chances to prove myself and work for a German company here in India,\" he said. Though he hasn't landed his dream job as yet, he's relying on the unwritten laws of the globalized world. \"It's no new concept that jobs are moving to cheap countries,\" said Ranjan. \"If Germany didn't do the same, it would lose a lot of business.\" The Goethe Institute too stands to profit from this young ambitious generation in India raring to use the German language as a weapon on the global marketplace. Kirti, a 21-year-old says that after a year and three months of learning German, she's now abandoned her idea of becoming an English language teacher and would now like to teach German instead at the Goethe Institute. \"All foreign languages are important for India because India is becoming increasingly important in the world,\" said Kirti. \"Germany is a new country for India, German is a new language. That just improves our career chances.\"",

"story": "Germany's new anti-terror units: A paramilitary excess? The German police are upgrading. A new special unit, BFE+, is being trained to counter terror attacks. However, the upgrade mainly serves as a psychological reassurance for the public, says criminologist Rafael Behr. DW: Prof. Behr, why does Germany's federal police need the special BFE+ unit (Beweissicherungs- und Festnahmeeinheit plus, which means \"evidence collection and arrest unit plus\")? Rafael Behr: Well, there are very different ideas among specialists and professionals in the police regarding the need for it. I see two aspects: one of them is symbolic. The symbolic nature of such a unit shows that we are strong; we can respond to attacks on a new scale. And we can react to situations at several crime scenes simultaneously. We can respond by using pervasive weapons and better equipment. That is the symbolic effect. There is also the functional effect; for example, to make it clear that we are prepared for anything. We no longer need to discuss the deployment of the armed forces inside the country [currently banned by the German constitution, the ed.] because we have enough equipment and manpower to handle these attacks that vacillate between crime and war. In addition to the five new special units, which together comprise 250 men, the GSG-9 and riot police have been operating for many years now. Who is responsible for what, in the event of an emergency? This is quite clearly defined, at least bureaucratically. The taking of hostages, terrorist camps and acts of serious crime, fall under the jurisdiction of the Special Operations Command Units (SEK, or SWAT teams) and mobile task forces of the individual states. They are trained and equipped for these tasks. The GSG-9 is responsible for particularly serious attacks, like the one at the Munich Olympics in 1972 or the 1977 plane hijacking in Mogadishu, which was actually the unit's first mission. The riot police (anti-riot police/rapid reaction forces) actually play no role in this context, but we have units for all eventualities, and that is the crucial difference. GSG-9 and SEKs are dynamic intervention units, not investigative units. What is intended now with the BFE+ is to have a unit to launch large-scale manhunts, say, after an attack, when terrorists retreat into hiding, as was the case in Paris. This has drawn attention to a gap because the normal federal police supposedly cannot do this \u2013 although I have my doubts about that. We live in times of terror; terrorists operate with weapons of war, which the police do not possess, and the armed forces, which have these weapons, are not allowed to intervene domestically. So is this a militarization of the police and is it a logical and sensible development? I've noticed for some time that the ideal of a civil police force, which originated in the 1990s, is disappearing more and more, and that the police are diversifying. Of course, we are all familiar with the beat officers on neighborhood patrol, but other work is also done. We are heading towards the other end of the policing spectrum, meaning to the point that it borders on war-like or military action. I would also not object if the Germany army contributed material in the case of terrorist attacks. Why should it not make available special protected vehicles or tanks to transport police forces? This should not be a big problem. Fortunately, emergency situations requiring special forces rarely occur. Would it not be more efficient if the state police and the federal police had more staff and better equipment? Demanding more staff and actually having more staff are two different matters, and although additional staff has been promised, it is still not immediately available. If we now hire 500 more employees in North Rhine-Westphalia or 3,000 more for the federal police, they are merely filling the gap that occurs when older officers retire. Thus, more police does not necessarily mean more security. Professor Rafael Behr is a criminologist and sociology professor at the Hamburg police academy. DW's Volker Wagener conducted this interview.",

"story": "Own goal gifts Kaiserslautern lucky win at Gladbach Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach have suffered another setback in their efforts to avoid relegation this year after gifting FC Kaiserslautern an own goal and conceding all three points in their Bundesliga clash on Friday night. FC Kaiserslautern came away 1-0 victors over Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach in the Bundesliga on Friday night after Gladbach keeper Logan Bailly gifted the visitors an own goal just past the 60-minute mark. A poor clearance by the Belgian goalie gave away a corner to Kaiserslautern midfielder Christian Tiffert, which Bailly then punched into his own net. Both teams began the match cautiously and chances were hard to come by in the first half. Kaiserslautern's Rodnei cleared a Martin Stranzl shot off the line and minutes later at the other end the Brazilian defender almost scored when his header hit team mate Mathias Abel. Christian Tiffert then went close with a low drive for the visitors. Gladbach's increasingly desperate attempts for an equalizer late in the match failed to trouble goalkeeper Kevin Trapp, playing in his second Bundesliga game. Marco Reus was unable to get to a cross from Mike Hanke for a late equalizer. Bottom-placed Gladbach had come into the match in desperate need of all three points to keep alive their hopes of avoiding relegation with only seven rounds remaining. Mired on 23 points, they now face the prospect of falling five points behind the pack in the hunt for safety should results not fall their way. Kaiserslautern, meanwhile, move up to 12th place on 31 points ahead of the remaining games to be played over the weekend. Author: Darren Mara (AFP, AP) Editor: Joanna Impey",

"story": "Kim Jong Un says ICBM testing in 'final stage' North Korea is close to developing an intercontinental ballistic missile after several nuclear tests, said the state's leader Kim Jong Un. He also urged the US to stop their \"anachronistic\" policy towards his country. The isolated state has \"soared\" as a nuclear power, Kim Jong Un said in his New Year's address on Sunday. North Korea was now a \"military power of the East that cannot be touched by even the strongest enemy,\" said Kim. The nation was preparing a test launch of an international ballistic missile, and the process has already \"reached the final stage,\" he insisted. Pyongyang has far conducted five nuclear tests, shrugging off international sanctions which aggravated the already poor economic situation in a tragically impoverished country. North Korea claims one of those tests was for a hydrogen-based weapon. Many experts dispute the claim, saying that all weapons tested were comparably less destructive atom bombs. There have also been contrasting reports on Pyongyang's ability to miniaturize a nuclear warhead and mount it on a missile. An ICBM projectile, armed with a small nuclear warhead, could potentially be used by North Korea against targets on US soil. In the address broadcast on Sunday, Kim praised \"marvelous feats\" aimed at boosting the North Korean military power. At the same time, he said efforts should be made to defuse the possibility of another Korean war between Pyongyang and Seoul. He also stressed the importance of building the economy under a five-year plan first published in May. Commenting on the US, Kim he called on Washington to make a \"resolute decision to withdraw its anachronistic hostile North Korea policy.\" Despite President-elect Donald Trump saying he might consider meeting with the communist leader, such a move seems unlikely.

"story": "Syrian forces counter major rebel assault with airstrikes Syrian government forces backed by airstrikes have launched a counteroffensive to repel a major assault by opposition fighters in the northern city of Aleppo. The rebels are battling to break a lengthy regime siege. Much of the fighting on Saturday was concentrated around Aleppo's western fringe where a coalition of rebel groups had gained ground on Friday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Britain-based monitoring group said insurgents were able to capture the neighborhood of Assad as part of a large-scale ground attack launched there on Friday. Backed by Russian and Syrian airstrikes, forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad's regime responded Saturday with an offensive of their own, but it was not clear whether they had managed to retake any lost ground. The Syrian army command said troops and their allies were pounding insurgent positions with rockets, adding that \"all kinds of weapons\" were being used in the fight for the Assad district. Civilians under siege Yasser al-Yousef of the Nour el-Din el-Zinki rebel faction said fighters had also launched an attack on Aleppo's western Zahraa neighborhood in a push to open up supply lines to the beleaguered eastern side of the divided city. The Syrian army said the troops were repelling the assault, which began later Saturday with a massive car bomb explosion near government positions. As many as 300,000 civilians are believed to be trapped in the rebel-controlled east, surrounded by government troops and with limited access to food and medical supplies. \"In just a few days, we will open the way for our besieged brothers,\" rebel commander Abu Mustafa told the AFP news agency Saturday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the rebel bombardment had killed at least 21 civilians since Friday. It was unable to provide a death toll for the rebel side. Air campaign Aleppo, Syria's largest city, has been devastated by some of the fiercest fighting seen in nearly six years of war. The rebel coalition has controlled many of the city's eastern districts since mid-2012, and government forces have been battling to retake them ever since. Russia, a key Assad ally, began providing air support to Syrian regime troops in 2015. Moscow implemented a three-day halt to bombing in Aleppo last week to allow civilians to leave the besieged east. Few managed to get out, however, and a UN evacuation plan failed because security could not be guaranteed. The United States on Friday rejected claims that attacks on Aleppo had stopped. \"The regime has rejected UN requests to deliver aid to eastern Aleppo - using starvation as a weapon of war,\" a US official told AFP. More than 300,000 people have died in Syria since the conflict broke out there in 2011. nm/sms (AFP, AP)",

"story": "Jordan repeals 'marry the rapist' law Lawmakers in Jordan have scrapped a controversial law that allowed rapists to escape punishment by marrying their victims. Activists are celebrating the change, calling it a \"historic achievement.\" Cheers and applause erupted from the spectators' gallery in the lower house of Jordan's parliament on Tuesday after legislators voted by a majority to abolish Article 308. The provision in the conservative kingdom's penal code allowed rape charges to be dropped if the perpetrator married his victim. Ahead of the vote, Prime Minister Hani Mulqi told the parliament he fully supported the repeal. \"The government is committed to eliminating Article 308 to reinforce the protection of the Jordanian family,\" he said. Read more - Uncensored: Muslim women speak about women's rights Long campaign Activists, who had campaigned for years to change the law, hailed the vote as a major step forward for ending sexual violence against women. Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at New York-based Human Rights Watch, praised the move in a tweet. \"The article did not have a positive effect on society. On the contrary, it was an easy way out for attackers,\" Hala Ahed, legal consultant at Jordanian Women's Union, told German news agency DPA. \"Now the repeal makes the state responsible for supporting victims of assault.\" The amendment must still be approved by the 65-member Senate, the upper house of parliament, and by King Abdullah II. \"Our work is not done yet,\" Ahed added. \"There is a conservative bloc within the Senate, so we will continue our mobilization until the law is ratified.\" Read more - Tunisia: Women celebrate their rights Several countries have similar laws Ahead of Tuesday's vote, several dozen activists rallied outside the parliament building in Amman, the capital, calling for repeal. Campaigners say the \"marry the rapist\" clause condemns girls to a lifetime of sexual violence and abuse at the hands of their rapist. But some Jordanian lawmakers had been apprehensive about change, arguing that the provision could be a form of \"protection\" from social stigma for some victims. Despite its pro-Western political orientation, many parts of Jordan remain socially conservative, with \"family honor\" an important value in many households. Jordanian parliamentarian Wafa Bani Mustafa, who campaigned to end the law, said last week that parents often agreed to such \"rapist marriages\" to minimize \"family shame,\" but she said no girl should be \"presented as a gift\" to her rapist. The repeal vote came a week after Tunisia scrapped a similar law. Morocco overhauled its \"marry the rapist\" legislation in 2014, and Egypt took the step in 1999. A number of countries in the region still have such laws, including Algeria, Libya, Lebanon, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Syria and the Palestinian Territories, according to Human Rights Watch. Outside the Middle East, some countries in Latin America, as well as the Philippines and Tajikistan also have \"marry the rapist\" clauses. nm/kms (AFP, AP, Reuters, dpa)",

"story": "Preliminary E. coli tests on sprouts prove negative Initial tests on sprouts from a market garden in Lower Saxony have turned up negative for E. coli. An outbreak of the bacteria has killed 22 people and made hundreds of others ill. Preliminary results conducted on sprouts from a farm in northern Germany have proved negative for E. coli. The agriculture ministry in the state of Lower Saxony said that tests on 23 of 40 samples found them to be free of E. coli. The testing is continuing. This comes a day after researchers named vegetable sprouts as the most likely source of the outbreak. Gert Lindemann, agriculture minister for Lower Saxony, said a market garden in the rural district of Uelzen had yielded a connection \"involving all the main outbreaks\" of the disease, which is thought to have affected more than 2,000 people. \"From our view, this is the most concrete source,\" said Lindemann. Although there was no definitive proof on Sunday, the ministry said the indications were strong enough to suggest people avoid sprouts for the time being. On Monday, German Consumer Affairs Minister Ilse Aigner said that despite the negative intial tests, the warning against eating sprouts and certain other vegetables remained in effect. \"Independent of the evidence from Lower Saxony, the Robert Koch Institute and the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment are for now sticking to their guidelines for raw cucumbers, tomatoes and lettuce, in northern Germany in particular,\" she told reporters at a press conference in Berlin. As well as apparent connections to the major outbreak, one employee of the northern German farm in question had also contracted the infection, authorities said. The farm, not far south of Hamburg, where the outbreak began, has been shut down pending conclusive results. All its products have been recalled as a precaution. The plant nursery grows a wide variety of sprouts from seeds imported from different countries. All the people who have become ill due to enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) bacteria either live in or have recently visited northern Germany. Spain plans to seek compensation The EHEC outbreak, which has claimed at least 22 lives in Europe and spread to 12 countries, was previously linked to a shipment of Spanish cucumbers upon which a different strain of E. coli was discovered. Spanish farmers have said they will seek compensation for losses incurred after their product was linked to the illness. Spain and Germany are to hold talks on this issue on Wednesday, after a Tuesday meeting of the European Commission and EU members. EU Agriculture Commissioner Dacian Ciolos said on Sunday, however, that no immediate decision on possible financial aid for farmers would be taken during Tuesday's talks. Russia and Portugal have already imposed a total ban on imports of vegetables from the EU. E. coli bacteria cause symptoms such as diarrhea, queasiness, vomiting and stomach pains. Extreme EHEC infections can lead to hemolytic-uremic syndrome, which causes severe kidney damage and can sometimes be fatal.

"story": "Chinese company buys ailing Frankfurt Hahn Airport A Shanghai construction company has bought a majority share in the long-stagnant airport, hoping to see its business take off again. It's betting that tourists and trade with Asia will be the salvation. German federal state Rhineland-Palatinate announced Monday that it had sold its majority stake in of Frankfurt's Hahn Airport to Shanghai Yigian Trading Company (SYT), in a deal worth somewhere in the \"low double-digit million euro range.\" According to Reuters, SYT counts as one of the leading construction companies in China. Roger Lewentz, Rhineland-Palatinate's interior minister, expressed hope that SYTwill give the aiprort an \"extra push\" to develop. Primarily used by discount airlines, especially Ireland-based Ryanair, Frankfurt Hahn has suffered through years of financial turbulence. It ended the 2014 fiscal year 45 million euros ($51 million) in the red. Another loss of 16 million euros is expected this year. While not offering any timeline for crawling back in the black, SYT announced on Monday its plan for revitalizing the airport, largely by increasing its business with Asia. Hoping to draw Asian tourists, SYT's chief representative Zu Tao Chou announced that the company was in talks with Chinese airline Yangtze River Express over its return to Frankfurt Hahn. The airline stopped operating at the airport in 2015, striking a blow to its business. SYT also aims to build the airport into a hub for freight deliveries. \"We expect good business in cargo deliveries of food to Asia,\" Chou said. Local-foreign partnership Rhineland-Palatinate had an 82.5 percent share in the airport's ownership. It will still maintain an involvement, including through subsidies and investment aid. Lewentz calculated that the Hahn will receive as much as 70 million euros in tax money between now and 2024. \"The support shows the high-priority the state government will ascribe to the site in the future,\" Lewentz said. According to the agreement though, SYT will have to supply at least half of the investments. Rhineland-Palatinate president Malu Dreyer is confident \"that the buyer will commit itself to the future of the location.\" SYT supported that sentiment, rather romantically. Chou said Monday that he \"lost his heart\" to the airport. Sealing the deal The state's legislative assembly still has to approve the sale in a vote expected before the body's summer recess. The European Commission also has to approve the state's continued involvement in the airport's operation. The airport is located about 120 kilometers (75 miles) away from Frankfurt am Main. Originally it served as a US military airbase before being converted to commercial use in 1993. Fraport, which operates the international flight hub Frankfurt Airport, sold its share to Rhineland-Palatinate in 2009 for a single euro. The German state of Hessen, where Frankfurt am Main is located, owns the remaining shares of the airport, about 17 percent. It is already in the \"home stretch\" of negotiations with SYT about a buyout, which could take place within the coming weeks. jtm/uhe (AFP, dpa, Reuers)",

"story": "Soccer captain Davide Astori of Fiorentina dies, aged 31 Italian football has reacted with shock to the death of Fiorentina captain and defender Davide Astori. He was found dead early on Sunday in his hotel room in Udine, where the team was due to play a Serie A match.  Fiorentina captain and defender Davide Astori died of a sudden illness on Sunday morning at the age of 31, the Serie A club said, leaving Italian football in a state of shock. Italian media reported that Astori was found by his team-mates in the early hours in his hotel room in Udine, where the team was staying ahead of an Italian league match. The German news agency DPA said the cause of death appeared to be cardiac arrest. The center back had just become a father two weeks ago. Fiorentina released a brief statement saying it is \"profoundly shaken\" by Astori's death. \"For this terrible and delicate situation, and above all out of respect for his family, we appeal to the sensitivity of the media,\" the club said. Former Italy Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, a former mayor of Florence, said Astori's passing \"seems impossible,\" adding that he was \"in a state of disbelief and I cry with his family and all for Fiorentina.\" Football's world governing body FIFA said everyone within Italian football was huddling around Astori's family. Astori joined Fiorentina on loan in August 2015 and the club signed him outright a year later. He previously spent six seasons at Cagliari and one on loan at AS Roma. He made 14 appearances for Italy's national side between 2012 and 2017. Fiorentina's match against Udinese has been called off along with all of Sunday's other matches, including the derby between AC Milan and Inter Milan. AC Milan coach Gennaro Gattuso had asked before the announcement for all games to be called off. \"I can't think of the derby after a tragedy like that,\" he said on Twitter. mm/rc (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.

"story": "Berlin Philharmonic Examines Nazi Past on 125th Birthday The world-famous Berlin Philharmonic celebrated its 125th anniversary with a free music marathon on Sunday -- and a look at the role it played in Nazi propaganda. Retirees, students, and parents with children filled the Philharmonie in Berlin to the fire limit on Sunday, Nov. 4. They were there to watch legendary British conductor Sir Simon Rattle, the orchestra's music director since 2002. Many also came, however, the get a glimpse into the dark side of the orchestra's history, as the Berlin Philharmonic used the anniversary as an opportunity to uncover its Nazi ties. Hitler's orchestra One of the last major German institutions to do so, the Philharmonic has opened up a significant part of its past to the public with a documentary film, an exhibition on \"degenerate\" music during the Third Reich and a book detailing the orchestra's operations in Nazi Germany. As the national Reichsorchester, the ensemble regularly performed for Hitler's birthday under director Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler. It was the only active orchestra during the war, and its members were exempted from military service and enjoyed a sense of prestige and normality despite the terror happening around them. Facing up to the past Both the film and the book by Misha Aster, available in English under the title \"The Berlin Philharmonic and the Third Reich,\" take closely examine the orchestra's role in Nazi propaganda and its activities as Nazi Germany's flagship cultural ambassador from 1933 to 1945. \"The solution offered by Goebbels in 1933 meant material and financial security for the orchestra and consequently acted as an insurance against bankruptcy,\" Aster wrote of a deal crafted by Joesph Goebbels, the head of Nazi propaganda. \"That naturally meant a major compromise.\" Part of the reason for the long overdue examination of the orchestra's role under National Socialism, said Aster, appears to stem from its post-war domination by the conductor Herbert von Karajan, a former Nazi Party member. But since Karajan's death in 1989 the orchestra has been through a major generational change with the average age of its members now about 41. The exhibition focuses on music that was banned during the Third Reich, either for being politically unacceptable or for having connections to Jews. It is a reconstruction of a Nazi propaganda exhibit from 1938, which had condemned works by celebrated composers like Paul Hindemith, Arnold Schoenberg, Igor Stravinsky and Kurt Weill. In a symbolic gesture, Stravinsky's \"Le sacre du printemps\" was performed the Philharmonic and Rattle on Sunday evening at the conclusion of the anniversary concert. Looking forward -- musically Under Rattle's direction, the Berlin Philharmonic has been changing its staunch traditionalist image as a bearer of German musical tradition. \"It's no longer the glamorous diva at the edge of the city,\" Rattle told the German DPA news agency. \"An orchestra can't just live in the past, it has to look forward.\" The conductor has stirred up controversy himself during his five years as musical director for allegedly deviating from the German orchestral tradition -- both in terms of the sound of the orchestra and its target audience. He has pushed for performing contemporary music and made efforts to win a younger audience. \"The audiences don't always come to us - we have to go to them,\" he said.",

"story": "Namibian Police Continue Hunt for German Tourist's Killers Police in Namibia were searching Tuesday for two men who shot dead a German tourist and kidnapped his wife shortly after their arrival in the normally tranquil desert state at the weekend. Johannes F., 56 and his wife Elke, 52, were hijacked at gunpoint by two men on Sunday after they had stopped at a bridge in the mountainous Khomas region west of the capital Windhoek to take photos, police spokesman Angula Amulungu said. The couple had arrived hours earlier in Namibia and were en route to the coastal resort of Swakopmund. The attackers shot and killed Johannes, kidnapped his wife, drove around in the couple's rental car for hours before dumping the body in a dry riverbed before becoming embroiled in a high-speed chase with a local farmer, according to local newspaper reports. Local Afrikaans daily Republikein reported that Johannes was shot after arguing with the hijackers and that he bled to death on his wife's lap. German media reported that he was shot in the head and killed instantly when the hijakers emerged from the bush. The car later overturned and the men fled, leaving behind Elke F., who was taken to hospital, where she was treated for minor injuries. Elke F. was in \"severe shock,\" according to Ute K\u00f6nig, permanent representative at the German embassy in Windhoek. Police are combing the Khomas Hochland area for the attackers, police spokesman Amulungu said. The attack dominated newspaper headlines Tuesday in Namibia, a quiet former German colony of around 2 million people famous for its desert scenery. \"The horrified reaction (to the attack) in the country reflects the exceptional nature of this crime,\" K\u00f6nig said.",

"story": "Record Number of Germans Moving Abroad Despite an improved economic situation, more Germans relocated outside the country in 2007 than in any year since reunification in 1990, raising concerns over a demographic crisis in the near future. Figures released on Monday, May 19, by the Federal Statistics Office showed that 165,180 German citizens migrated elsewhere last year, an increase of nearly 10,000 from 2006. The top destinations were Switzerland, the United States, Poland and Austria. A total of 111,291 Germans returned from abroad in 2007, resulting in a net loss of 53,889 citizens, the third straight year in which more Germans have left the country than returned. Both the number of Germans leaving the country and the net loss of German citizens were the highest since reunification in 1990, adding to concerns that Germany is heading towards a demographic crisis. Population experts have long been warning that Germany's ageing, shrinking population will be detrimental to Europe's largest economy in future. Population dropped for fifth year in a row The Statistics Office reported that, with a net total of 101,691 foreigners moving to Germany last year, there was a net gain from migration of 47,802. Additionally, the country saw its first increase in the number of births in a decade, with some 690,000 births recorded. But these numbers combined were not enough to offset the estimated 825,000 deaths in 2007. Overall, this resulted in a drop in the German population for the fifth straight year. Experts have predicted that the German population could fall to as low as 69 million in 2050 from some 82 million today.",

"story": "Bangladeshi man faces state and federal terror charges in New York The suspect was the only person seriously injured in the blast, but he is expected to appear in court. Meanwhile President Donald Trump seized on the attack to call for stricter immigration rules. New York City police and federal prosecutors on Tuesday charged a Bangladeshi man with terrorism, in connection with his attempt to blow himself up inside the city's crowded subway network during Monday morning's rush hour. Police charged 27-year-old Akayed Ullah with supporting an act of terrorism, making a terrorist threat and criminal possession of a weapon. These charges fall under New York state law. Federal prosecutors charged him with providing material support to terrorists and using weapons of mass destruction. Ullah is accused of detonating a crudely made pipe bomb that was strapped to his body. The blast occurred in an underground warren of pedestrian tunnels that connect the Port Authority Bus Terminal with the subway network. Four people were injured in the blast but only Ullah was seriously wounded. The three wounded victims had relatively minor complaints such as ringing in their ears and headaches. Ullah was hospitalized with burns to his hands and stomach but he is expected to appear in court to answer the charges. The blast, which clearly did not have the lethal effect that was intended, nonetheless created short term panic and snarled public transit traffic as key subway stations were temporarily closed off during the morning rush. Mayor Bill de Blasio called the blast an attempted terrorist attack, and officials said it appeared to be a rare if not unprecedented attempt at suicide bombing on U.S. soil. Trump seizes on attack Law enforcement officials said they had found evidence that Ullah was inspired by the \"Islamic State\" (IS). Ullah had no direct contact with IS, but police said they had found evidence that he watched IS propaganda online. Ullah taunted US President Donald Trump on his Facebook page Monday, writing, \"Trump you failed to protect your nation.\" Ullah entered the country legally in 2011, based on a visa program based on family connections in the US. Trump seized on the news to renew his call for greater immigration restrictions. \"Today's terror suspect entered our country through extended-family chain migration, which is incompatible with national security,\" Trump said in a statement that called for various changes to the immigration system. Earlier, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump's proposed policies \"could have prevented this.\" Meanwhile, police in Bangladesh have questioned Ullah's wife, according to multiple officials who declined to give their names as they were not permitted to discuss the matter publicly. \"We have found his wife and in-laws in Dhaka. We are interviewing them,\" said one local police official. Ullah last visited Bangladesh in September to see his wife and newborn baby. bik/msh (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa)",

"story": "New EU prosecutors to fight fraud The European Union loses a lot of money each year through corruption and subsidy fraud. Now, a new institution is supposed to clamp down on the problem and prosecute offenders across EU borders. \"The bigger, the better,\" is what some Austrian farmers seem to have thought when they simply declared some unused fields as an agricultural area. For two years they cashed in with farm subsidies from the EU. At the end of 2012, the scam was discovered and since then, the EU is demanding that Austria pay back the subsidies totaling some 64 million euros. Normally, it is the EU member states themselves which are supposed to prosecute such scams, explains Dominik Brodowski, a German attorney. But members in past years \"have shown on several occasions that they are not that eager to prosecute crimes in which the EU is the target,\" he told Deutsche Welle. This was in part because the various countries' national authorities are organized differently, but also because EU subsidies are EU funds and not part of any individual national budget. EU authority to coordinate The EU is no longer prepared to put up with this and, in the 2007 Lisbon treaty, decided to set up an EU prosecutors office. This authority is now ready to tackle cross-border prosecutions, if there are crimes or other misconduct committed at the expense of the EU. Justice commissioner Viviane Reding on Monday (15.07.2013) introduced a new bill to that end in the EU parliament. According to the draft, EU prosecutors would handle EU-wide infractions, while the state prosecutors of EU members would continue pursuing cases based on their respective national laws. An EU prosecutor-general would be chosen for an eight-year term with four deputies and would work closely with at least one prosecutor in each member state. The decentralized setup is based on a recent proposal made by German Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger. 500 million euros each year Justice Commissioner Reding announced a zero-tolerance policy in fighting crime. She also pointed out that, so far, there was only a 42 percent success rate when it came to prosecuting fraud cases with EU funds. This must change, she said, if for no other reason than the EU simply does not have the money to tolerate such crimes. Last year, at least 500 million euros was lost to fraud and corruption, Reding said. The damage done is not only financial, but also tarnishes the EU's reputation. It boosts the arguments of euroskeptics and helps them mobilize anti-EU support. Furthermore, EU money comes from EU taxpayers, Reding emphasized. She called on EU member states and the EU parliament to come to a quick decision on the EU prosecutors office so that it could become operational by early 2015. Not everyone on board The Association of German Judges has welcomed the draft. Board member, Peter Schneiderhan, told German public radio that an EU prosecutor would mostly ensure that crimes could be prosecuted under the same conditions across the EU. Attorney Brodowski called the move \"a necessary step.\" The new prosecutors office still has some hurdles to take, however. Denmark and Britain do not want to be part of it. Brodowski pointed out that the plans, in fact, would certainly affect the sovereignty of member states. In future, there would no longer be national prosecutors to press charges, but instead one European authority.

"story": "New Zealand PM announces pregnancy New Zealand's prime minister is due to have a baby in June and will take six weeks of maternity leave. She said that like many women she can balance child rearing and professional responsibilities.  New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced on Friday that she is expecting a child with her partner Clarke Gayford. \"This year we'll join the many parents who wear two hats. I'll be PM & a mum while Clarke will be 'first man of fishing' & stay at home dad,\" Ardern said. The 37-year-old took over leadership of the labor party just three months before the September 23 election. She found out she was pregnant on October 13, two weeks before becoming prime minister. Ardern said that she had asked Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters to take over her duties for six weeks after the expected June due date. \"I fully intend to be contactable and available throughout the six-week period when needed,\" she said. \"I will make arrangements for appropriate ministers to act in my other portfolios over the six weeks I am away from Parliament.\" \"Clarke and I are privileged to be in the position where Clarke can stay home to be our primary care-giver. Knowing that so many parents juggle the care of their new babies, we consider ourselves to be very lucky,\" she said. Gayford has a fishing television program and was even out at sea the day Ardern was announced labor party leader. Ardern had previously said that she and Gayford wanted a family but that they had doubts whether she could conceive. \"Clarke and I have always been clear we wanted to be parents but had been told we would need help for that to happen,\" she said. \"That's made this news a fantastic surprise.\" Woman's choice The prospect of Ardern starting a family and being prime minister at the same time came up during the election when a television journalist suggested the public had right to know her plans. She answered but said that it was unacceptable for employers to ask such questions from women and that child rearing should not be an obstacle for women's professional advancement. \"For other women, it is totally unacceptable in 2017 to say that women should have to answer that question in the workplace,\" she said. \"It is a woman's decision about when they choose to have children and it should not predetermine whether or not they are given a job or have job opportunities,\" she said. \"I've been really open about that dilemma because I think probably lots of women face it,\" she said. \"For me, my position is no different to the woman who works three jobs, or who might be in a position where they are juggling lots of responsibilities.\" The comments resonated with many voters. Ardern will be only the second world leader to give birth while in office. Former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had a daughter in 1990. cw/rc (AFP, AP, dpa)",

"story": "Germany Chooses \"Culture Capital\" Finalists Two very different German cities -- G\u00f6rlitz and Essen -- have been chosen as finalists from among 10 hopefuls to compete for the title \"European Capital of Culture\" in 2010. The jury which made the decision said it chose Essen due to its successful transformation from an industrial hub at the heart of the Ruhr region to a center of culture and science whose influence extends beyond its municipal borders. G\u00f6rlitz/Zgorzelec, a city on the German/Polish border that was split in two by political developments, was chosen because judges said it represents a spirit of reconciliation and a Europe which is growing ever closer together after a century of war, expulsion and division. Tourist magnet The citizens of G\u00f6rlitz let the champagne corks fly when the news was announced on Thursday evening. The city worked hard to restore its historic city center, left intact after the war, to its former glory, and for that reason, has become a tourist magnet in eastern Germany. But beauty aside, the town has been hit hard by the unemployment, westward migration and high vacancy rates seen throughout the eastern states. City officials are counting on the title of Culture Capital to dispel some of the gloom. \"We were both anxious and hopeful,\" said Kai Grebasch, spokesman for the city's Culture Capital office. \"When the good news finally came, we were all speechless with joy.\" In Essen, too, the relief over remaining in the race was palpable. Faced with the decline of traditional industries such as mining, the Ruhr region is attempting to reinvent itself, in the same way that British industrial cities such as Manchester and Liverpool have transformed themselves into hip cultural centers. Whole new future \"The jury picked up exactly our concern, which is to rededicate the whole region culturally, and make a whole new future possible,\" said North Rhine-Westphalia's Minister for Culture, Michael Vesper. The jury judged each candidate city's application on whether it presented a theme which explored ideas that were central to the European experience. And in this, Essen and G\u00f6rlitz came out ahead of the other candidates Braunschweig, Bremen, Halle, Karlsruhe, Kassel, L\u00fcbeck, Potsdam and Regensburg. Germany is expected to pass on the recommendations to Br\u00fcssels in the fall, where the final decision will be made in 2006.",

"story": "UN: South Sudan leaders schedule talks this week in Ethiopia UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has traveled to South Sudan in an effort to broker face-to-face talks with the leaders of the country's warring factions. He said a meeting between the sides was likely later this week. On Tuesday, Ban Ki-moon said from Juba that the leaders of South Sudan's warring factions \u2013 rebels led by former Vice President Riek Machar, and supporters of President Salva Kiir \u2013 were to meet for direct talks with each other this week in Ethiopia. \"Fighting must end. Much damage has already been done. It may take long to heal,\" Ban said. \"The country's leaders must close the wounds they have opened. They must support justice and accountability for the crime committed and they must act to address the root causes of the conflict.\" The meeting in Addis Ababa is to be facilitated by the prime minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn. Heartbreaking, says Ban The conflict has been broiling since December. A peace agreement reached in January did not hold, and thousands of people have been killed in the meantime. In addition, the United Nations human rights chief has cautioned that the situation needs to be brought under control before turning into a Rwanda-like genocide or a devastating famine. In Juba, Ban met with Kiir and refugees in a UN camp that is filled beyond capacity by many thousand people. \"What I have seen and heard today breaks my heart and enrages my soul,\" Ban said, adding the \"conflict destroying this fragile young country is senseless.\" During a joint press conference, Kiir said he would attend the meeting in Addis Ababa. Machar spoke with Ban by phone and said he would do his best to make it there by Friday, the date put forth by Ethiopian's Desalegn. \"He said he will try his best, because he is in a very remote area,\" Ban said. mz/ipj (AP, Reuters, AFP)",

"story": "Abubakar Adam Ibrahim: northern Nigeria's 'literary provocateur' In his first novel \"Season of Crimson Blossoms\" Abubakar Adam Ibrahim speaks openly about female sexuality, broaching a taboo subject in conservative northern Nigeria. Gwendolin Hilse reports. \u201cAnd because they were alone in the house, because she had always wanted to, because she could not stop herself, she moaned. With his tongue, he unlocked something deep within her. She soared with tears streaming down her face.\u201d You could hear a pin drop while Abubakar Adam Ibrahim read out loud from his first novel \"Season of Crimson Blossoms\" to an audience at the Thought Pyramid Art Center in Nigeria's capital Abuja. 50 pairs of eyes were fixed on the 37-year-old author. A couple of girls in the back row - conservatively dressed with headscarves - stared at ground giggling softly to themselves. The subject of Ibrahim's novel is the sexual emancipation of Hajiya Binta Zubairu, a Muslim woman in conservative Nigeria. It is a society in which women are denied the right to sexual desire, especially when they have fulfilled the \"obligations of childbirth\" and are post-menopause. Binta, who belongs to this category, speaks for millions who have previously remained silent. She has done what society expected of her and lived according to its rules and yet, nonetheless, succeeds in liberating herself from its constraints by having an affair with a local crook 20 years her junior. Subject matter like this suffices to trigger heated debate in Nigera's mainly Muslim north and predominantly Christian south. \"It was not easy while writing to keep a balance between reality and respect for Hausa culture,\" Ibrahim told DW. The Hausa ethnic group in northern Nigeria is very sensitive about how its society, traditions and values are portrayed. But Ibrahim knew that he had to expose the sexual repression of northern Nigerian women. There are many Bintas out there whose voices are not being heard. \"Picture of our society\" Ibrahim, who works as a journalist for one of Nigeria's leading daily newspapers, published a collection of short stories in 2012. \"Season of Crimson Blossoms\" was first published by Parresia in Nigeria in 2015. In June 2015, Cassava Republic bought the rights for international publication. The first edition quickly sold out in Nigeria. \"As a Hausa woman, I was rather shocked when I read the book because it deals which subjects which are taboo in our culture,\" said 30-year-old Bilkisu Ahmad. \"But it really is a realistic picture of our society.\" Overcoming trauma \"Season of Crimson Blossoms\" describes not only the affair of an unlikely couple but also a society in upheaval, locked in conflict between the modern age and the traditions of the past. The novel explores the conflicts and violence that have shaped Nigeria over the past decades and that have turned neighbors into enemies and left the victims of terrorism trying to resolve their traumas without any help from anyone.Ibrahim is himself a member of the Hausa ethnic group. He grew up in Jos, a city in northern Nigeria which has a history of ethnic and religious unrest. Binta, the main character in the novel, loses her husband and her oldest son through ethnically-motivated violence. The novel was his personal attempt to try and come to terms with his own experiences and the never-ending crisis in his home city. \"It is terrible to have to watch how the city that one loves is destroyed, especially when that destruction comes from within,\" he said. It took a long time for Ibrahim to get over the broken relationships with people who had once been neighbors or school friends. \"The worst of it is that people deliberately ignore what happened and nobody talks about it,\" he said. That's why he believes it is important to draw attention to the plight of the traumatized who never receive proper counseling in Nigeria. The voice of the north Ibrahim joins a long list of Nigerian authors who have won international acclaim such as Chinua Achebe and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Most of them came from the south of the country. Northern Nigeria does indeed have an extensive literature of its own, but most of it is written in Hausa and therefore accessible only to a small readership. But now that authors such as Ibrahim and Elnathan John are publishing in English, stories from northern Nigeria are acquiring a bigger, more international audience. Ibrahim made a conscious decision to write in English. \"I think it is more necessary than ever before that the north [of Nigeria] establishes contact with the south and the rest of the world,\" he said. His publisher Bibi Bakare Yusuf agrees wholeheartedly. She founded her publishing house, Cassava Republic, in Abuja in 2006. It now has offices in London and is launching their list in the United States in April 2017. Bridge between cultures Yusuf is proud of her young writers and believes there is a great need for stories from the north. \"For many Nigerians, people from other parts of the country are effectively foreigners,\" she said. Yusuf comes from Nigeria's financial and commercial hub, Lagos, in the south. \"We know almost nothing about one another. Literature is a sort of bridge between cultures.\" In spite of its controversial subject matter, Abubakar Adam Ibrahim's first novel received instant acclaim. He is included in the Hay Festival's Africa 39, which is a list of the 39 most promising African writers under the age of 40. In October 2016, he won the Nigerian Literature Prize which is worth $100,000 (95,000 euros). He has also been awarded the \"African Writers' Residency Award\" by Germany's Goethe Institute and the Sylt Institute. In the summer of this year he will spend two months of the North Frisian island of Sylt working on his next novel.",

Joining Brazil, Russia and India, the five nations are seeking to establish a development bank. Xi received a formal welcome complete with a 21-gun honor guard salute Tuesday in the South African capital, Pretoria. Zuma and Xi are expected to sign several agreements before traveling to Durban later in the day. BRICS summit to kick off Finance ministers at the BRICS summit, which will begin its fifth edition with a dinner banquet hosted by Zuma, are expected to present a feasibility study on the establishment of a new development bank to challenge the World Bank's decades-long dominance. Many in the developing world consider the World Bank, as well as the International Monetary Fund, to be western-dominated. Each of the five nations could be expected to contribute as much as $10 billion to capitalize the bank. Some have suggested that South Africa, the smallest country in the group, could host the bank in Pretoria in lieu of providing a large cash injection. Zuma has said the summit is also an opportunity to address South Africa's economic problems. \"BRICS provides an opportunity for South Africa to promote its competitiveness,\" he said. \"It is an opportunity to move further in our drive to promote economic growth and confront the challenge of poverty, inequality and unemployment that afflicts our country.\" Presidents Dilma Rouseff of Brazil, Vladimir Putin of Russia, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India, as well as Xi and Zuma, will be in attendance for the presentation from economics ministers on Wednesday. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa account for 25 percent of global GDP and 40 percent of the world's population, economic data show. African investment The Chinese president arrived in South Africa from Tanzania, where he signed agreements to boost Beijing's trade, economic and cultural ties with the country. It is Xi's first since taking office. During a speech in Dar es Salaam Tuesday, Xi vowed to continue a $20 billion (15.5 billion euro) credit line to African nations over the next two years. China has become one of the world's leading investors in Africa. Trade last year between China and South Africa totaled $60 billion, accounting for almost one third of China's trade in Africa. Trade with the continent reached around $200 billion last year, up from just $1 billion in 2000. After the BRICS summit, Xi will travel to the Republic of Congo. dr/hc (AFP, dpa, PTI)",

"story": "When Freedom Gets the Death Sentence The murder of a Turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left Berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class. But how deep does the concept of honor run among some immigrant communities? On a cold afternoon this week, Hatin S\u00fcr\u00fcc\u00fc gazed gravely from a large poster behind a bus stop lined with flowers, cards and candles. To the people who came to this bleak part of Berlin's Tempelhof district for Tuesday's solemn vigil -- called not by the city's Muslim community but a gay and lesbian organization -- the image of the young woman in a headscarf, a baby in her arms, was familiar from newspapers and television. A few notes at the memorial read, \"Hope you get a better deal in your next life,\" and \"Live a life on your own terms.\" \"It's a scandal,\" said Ali K, 33. \"All Muslims in Berlin should take to the streets to protest.\" Yasemin, 22, said, \"It's horrific. All Hatin was doing was leading her life the way she wanted.\" But it was a choice she paid for with her life. On Feb. 7, 23-year-old Hatin S\u00fcr\u00fcc\u00fc was gunned down at the aforementioned bus stop. She died on the spot. Shortly afterwards, three of her brothers -- who reportedly had long been threatening her -- were arrested. Investigators suspect it was a so-called \"honor killing,\" given the fact that S\u00fcr\u00fcc\u00fc's ultra-conservative Turkish-Kurdish family strongly disapproved of her modern and \"un-Islamic\" life. S\u00fcr\u00fcc\u00fc grew up in Berlin and was married off at 16 to a cousin in Istanbul. After a few years, she returned to the German capital with her young son, moved into a home for single mothers, completed school and began to train as an electrician. She stopped wearing a headscarf and was said to be outgoing and vivacious. \"She lived like a German\" Though not the first of its kind, the brazen shooting has sent shockwaves through Berlin, home to a large foreign community and which for years has fretted over steady ghetto-building in districts dominated by Turkish and Arab immigrants. While the incident has reopened debate on the integration of immigrants and the compatibility of Islamic values with Western ones, it\u2019s the reaction of a small group of Turkish students to the murder that has rattled the German capital. Days after Hatin S\u00fcr\u00fcc\u00fc was killed, some male students of Turkish origin at a high school near the scene of the crime reportedly downplayed the act. During a class discussion on the murder, one said, \"She (Hatin S\u00fcr\u00fcc\u00fc) only had herself to blame,\" while another remarked \"She deserved what she got --the whore lived like a German.\" The school's director promptly dashed off a letter to parents and students, castigating the students and warning that the school didn\u2019t tolerate incitement against freedom. \"Her lifestyle didn't fit\" The comments have sparked outrage and left many asking if it was just a one-off or whether such thinking is in fact not entirely uncommon among sections of the Muslim community in the city. According to some, it isn't. \"There isn't a single school with a high foreign population where teachers haven't faced this kind of thing, where individual students sometimes regard murder as a just sentence,\" said Heinz Wagner, head of school and education policy at the VBE teachers trade union and a school director himself. Referring to the controversial remarks on S\u00fcr\u00fcc\u00fc's murder, he said, \"The very fact that they decided to provoke with something like that tells you that they're getting their ideas from somewhere.\" At Berlin's Turkish-dominated neighborhood near Kottbusser Tor in the Kreuzberg district, 17-year-old Erkan, a high school student of Turkish origin, was divided about the issue. \"I'm not saying you should murder, but Hatin's lifestyle just didn't fit the way traditional Muslims live,\" he said. Please click on the second page to continue reading the story No regret, but pride Experts insist that the problem is in no way a purely \"Islamic phenomenon\" and that the remarks of a few shouldn't be allowed to taint an entire community. But, statistics in Berlin show that murders ostensibly meant to uphold the honor of the family are high among Muslims. At the juvenile prison in the Berlin suburb Pl\u00f6tzensee, six of the current 529 inmates are serving time of six years and more for manslaughter in so-called \"honor crimes.\" All come from the Muslim world. Aged between 18 and 22, one of them, an Afghan national, was 16 when he helped relatives kill a widowed aunt who had refused to marry her brother-in-law. Prison director Marius Fiedler said most of the murders are often carefully plotted in the family with the support of all, including women. \"Usually the patriarch selects the youngest son to carry out the crime because he knows that judges in Germany don't usually give the maximum sentence of 10 years to a minor for manslaughter,\" he said. Fiedler admitted that getting the inmates, who undergo psychological therapy, to reform or change their attitudes is difficult. \"Many come from rural areas in Turkey or Lebanon and just don't know the concept of individualism,\" he said. \"They don't feel any regret for what they did though some even kill their favorite sister. Instead, they're honored and feel like martyrs for having been chosen to carry out the crime.\" Ethics class the answer? The realization that murder and archaic concepts of honor might actually find favor with some teenagers in the city, have caused alarm among Berlin's politicians and some Muslim organizations. \"It might be a minority, but even one person applauding the murder of Hatin S\u00fcr\u00fcc\u00fc is absolutely unacceptable,\" said Kenan Kolat, head of the Turkish Association in Berlin and Brandenburg. His organization has initiated a discussion with teachers, politicians, parents and imams and is planning to work with Turkish newspapers and TV stations in Berlin to kick-start a debate on democratic values among the Turkish community. \"We have to begin speaking about the role of women, about honor concepts, dignity, mutual respect and democratic values,\" Kolat said. In addition to city politicians' plans to introduce a mandatory ethics course in schools across Berlin, Kolat is pushing for an Islamic studies course. \"The mainstream classroom has to be the place where one can get information about Islam, not in 'Islamic institutes' who have the theological upper hand in the city,\" he said. Some, however, are skeptical of such flash-in-the-pan plans. \"Every time there's a controversial incident, politicians routinely come up with 'ethics class' as a panacea,\" said school director Wagner. \"But the school can't be the only place for learning democratic values. You have to begin with the family.\"",

"story": "Swiss open probe into spying on its Turkish community A criminal investigation has been opened into allegations that the Ankara government has spied on expatriate Turks. Several academic events in Switzerland were reportedly filmed and photographed by unspecified agents. Swiss prosecutors said on Friday they had \"concrete suspicions [of espionage] against the Turkish community in Switzerland [by] a political intelligence service.\" The Office of the Attorney General confirmed it had opened a criminal investigation on March 16, after receiving a green light from the Swiss government. Prosecutors, however, refused to provide details on which specific people or organizations the investigation was targeting. University events filmed The investigation follows reports that in January, two men took photos of the participants at a University of Zurich seminar discussing the 1915 Armenian genocide by Ottoman Turks, a term which the Ankara government vehemently rejects. Local media reported that other events at the University in late 2016 and early 2017 were filmed or photographed, including one where the editor in chief of the Turkish newspaper \"Cumhuriyet\" was honored. On Thursday, the Swiss foreign minister told his Turkish counterpart that his country would \"rigorously investigate\" any illegal spying by Ankara on expatriate Turks and urged Turkey to comply with Swiss law. Close to 70,000 Turkish citizens live in Switzerland, according to Swiss government statistics, while the Turkish embassy's website refers to 130,000 Turkish nationals. Guarded response Still, the Swiss government has been trying to avoid a confrontation similar to those seen in Germany and the Netherlands in recent weeks after Turkish ministers were banned from attending political rallies in support of a referendum on Turkey's new draft constitution. The vote on April 16 would see Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's powers massively expanded, amid criticism that he has already sought to crack down on dissent. Switzerland has not blocked the campaign events, but Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu did call off a visit earlier this month after the hotel he had booked for a rally refused to host it. Separate lawsuit In mid-March, a member of Switzerland's upper house of parliament, Josef Dittli, filed a lawsuit accusing two Turkish organizations of spying on Turkish citizens and dual nationals living in Switzerland and requested an investigation. His suit singled out the Swiss Turkish-Islamic Foundation (TISS) and the Union of European Turkish Democrats and said Turkish diplomatic institutions might also be involved, according to the ATS news agency. Allegations of intelligence gathering by Erdogan supporters have arisen elsewhere in Europe. Last month, German police raided the apartments of four imams suspected of spying for Turkey's government on followers of US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, accused by Ankara of organizing a failed coup last July. mm/sms (AFP, Reuters)",

"story": "Russia sees positive effects of a less confrontational foreign policy Nuclear deals, trade agreements, signatures on international treaties: Russia has been in a cooperative mood since the turn of the year. Moscow has discovered the benefits of a less confrontational foreign policy. As recently as the end of 2009, it looked as though the Russia of old was rising anew. Moscow seemed intent on promoting itself as a global power in the mould of the former Soviet Union with its own interests at the heart of all its foreign policy decisions and the right to walk away from any international agreements if they failed to satisfy the Kremlin's demands. In President Dmitry Medvedev, Russia looked to have a leader who smiled warmly but still shook hands with the iron grip of his predecessor Vladimir Putin. Far from being the youthful reformist unencumbered by a KGB past, Medvedev was beginning to act more like the hardened Putin than the Russian prime minister himself. After fighting a war with Georgia \u2013 viewed by many observers as an overly aggressive and disproportional exhibition of Russian military power \u2013 Medvedev seemed emboldened. He kept the Russian stance firm on issues such as Iran, issued warnings over the proposed US missile shield and NATO's eastern expansion, and while agreeing to President Barack Obama's calls for a re-setting of relations, he made it clear that Russia would resort to the default position of suspicion if it wasn't happy with the results. While it was nowhere near the level of Moscow's Cold War rhetoric, there was a definite chill blowing out of Red Square. Fast forward to July 2010 and Russia seems to be a very different animal. The snarling bear with a sore head has been replaced by a more placid beast and while it may not be ready to roll over and have its tummy tickled just yet, Russia certainly seems less likely to take a bite out of its rivals than at any other time in the past year. Medvedev pursues new alliances with US, EU Last week, Medvedev gave one of his boldest foreign policy statements since becoming president by calling for the formation of new alliances with the United States and the European Union. Focusing on trade and investment, the Russian president called for US and EU cooperation in making his vision of a modernized Russia come to fruition through the exchange of capital and technology. His speech, which came just days before German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrived in Yekaterinburg to sign off on a raft of new trade deals, is just the latest sign of Moscow's new softer foreign policy towards the West, reversing the earlier trend of issuing Cold War-era anti-Western threats in an attempt to get what he wanted. There has been a growing rapprochement since the turn of the year with Medvedev reaching out to the United States, Britain and many of the other leading European Union member states on issues such as trade, security and economic affairs. The Russian president appears to have changed tack after realising that Russia can more efficiently satisfy its needs through cooperation than it can through confrontation. \"Medvedev recognizes that Russia can only develop as a major power when it modernizes,\" Margarete Klein, an expert on Russian foreign and security policy at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told Deutsche Welle. \"In order to modernize Russia's economy and industry, Russia needs cooperation partners from abroad \u2013 and those modernization partners are to be found mostly in the West. That's the logic that lies beneath Russia's new softer foreign policy towards the West. It shows that external policy is seen as an instrument for internal development and modernization.\" \"Russia had to learn hard lessons from the global financial crisis,\" she added. \"It had to learn that its economic policy is to a great extent connected with developments outside of Russia. In order to modernize, Russia desperately needs Western investment. Therefore, a policy of confrontation would be counterproductive.\" New policy apparent in Russia's stance on global issues In May, a leaked foreign ministry document that was published by the Russian edition of Newsweek magazine detailed Moscow's desire to pursue a less confrontational foreign policy and named 61 countries with which it wanted to improve relations, including key EU business partners Germany, Italy and France, a number of Baltic republics, and Russian arms clients such as India, China and Venezuela. \"Leaks often happen in the West but it is unusual in Russia,\" Asher Pirt, a specialist and researcher on Russian and Central Asian affairs for the British East West Center, told Deutsche Welle. \"It appears clear that it is an official document but it is unlikely to have been leaked without a decision made at a high level. Russia does want to have good relations with the West in order to achieve its foreign policy goals and wants to convince the West that Russia can be trusted. Sadly Russia's critics in the West will demand more evidence than a leaked document.\" In an attempt to show it is willing to embrace a softer policy with the West, Russia appears to have changed its stance on Iran. For a long time, Moscow was against further international sanctions against Tehran over its controversial nuclear program but in the last round of UN Security Council discussions, Russia was among those nations which agreed to an extension of the measures. This support of sanctions prompted anger in Iran but praise from the United States. Medvedev then announced that Russia believed that Iran was moving closer to having the potential to create nuclear weapons, one of the first times the Kremlin had recognized in public that Iran may be moving toward a nuclear weapon. The US warmly welcomed the statements. \"There seem to be two reasons for Russia's new stance on Iran,\" said Klein. \"On the one hand, Russia is getting more dissatisfied with the Iranian government. On the other hand, Moscow knows that it has to deliver something in order to keep the reset with the US moving forward. And agreeing to a new round of UN sanctions was a clear implicit benchmark for further Russian-American engagement.\" However, Asher Pirt believes that Russia is still trying to balance its new policy with the West with its older policy of engagement with the Iranian leadership. \"The significant change in Russian thinking has been the realisation that the threat from an Iranian Nuclear weapon is not far away,\" he said. \"This is a threat to Russian as well as Western security, as it is the ultimate deterrence from military action. The problem is that the West and Russia have had nuclear capability for sometime but have always been reluctant to use nuclear weapons but Iran might not have such qualms.\" Pirt added that despite Russia's recent move towards the US, its stance is still not as strong as that of the US and that Moscow continues to support weak sanctions. \"The recent signing of the 'roadmap' on long-term cooperation in the energy sphere with Iran shows that Russia has not completely closed its ties with the Iranian regime.\" New cooperation with US, EU faces challenges ahead Still, Russia's change could not have happened without some reciprocation coming from the West. In the past year, the external setting for Russia's foreign policy has improved with the Europeans and US becoming more engaged in cooperation with Russia. Russian-American relations continue to improve within the 'reset' context while Russia and NATO have eased tensions after agreeing a 'new beginning' in relations. Each situation allows Russia to feel valued as a partner and gives it a momentum to pursue better ties. However, there will undoubtedly be challenges ahead to test the new Russian policy. Russia's position in regard to Iran has not changed fundamentally and Moscow is still reluctant to further, harder sanctions despite agreeing to the last round. While NATO's eastern expansion may be on hold, there are still issues over Georgia's wish to become a member of both NATO and the EU. Both may test Moscow's new softly-softly approach to the US and Europe. \"It is clear that Georgia is unlikely to become a member of the EU as long as its territory is in question in regard to the existence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia,\" said Pirt. \"It would be unpopular with a number of groups in Russia if Georgia became a member of the EU or even NATO. Russia wants closer ties with the EU. However, Russia considers it has interests in Georgia.\" Moscow would definetely prefer a Georgian membership in the EU rather than NATO, said Klein. \"Georgia's membership in NATO is a clear red line for Russia. Such a step would not only worsen the relationship with Tbilisi, but also put an end to the 'new beginning' in its relations with NATO.\" Author: Nick Amies Editor: Michael Knigge",

"story": "Middle East Quartet pushes for fresh peace talks Representatives of the Middle East Quartet are pushing Israel and the Palestinians to resume peace talks. The aim is to reach an agreement by the end of 2012. But both sides are skeptical. For a long time the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas was considered hesitant and indecisive, but his bid to join the United Nations has given him a popularity boost among his own people. Many consider their president's demand that Palestine be internationally recognized as an independent state just plain self-evident. But that certainty is not shared the world over, and criticism of the UN application is widespread among western nations. They don't want the Palestinians to go it alone and are therefore pushing for the resumption of the peace talks that stalled more than a year ago. Slowly does it As of this week, the Middle East Quartet, which comprises the US, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations - has relaunched its efforts to find a solution to the ongoing conflict. It is planning separate meetings with chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and Jizchak Molcho, representative for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Among those taking part in the indirect talks is the UN special envoy and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and EU representative and German diplomat Helga Schmidt. Their proposed timetable for a peace treaty is the end of next year. Ruprecht Polenz, chairman of the foreign committee of the lower house of the German Parliament, is cautiously optimistic. \"The expectations are not very high,\" he told Deutsche Welle. \"But we are always hopeful that indirect talks lead to direct ones and that the direct talks become substantial negotiations, which are seen through to the end.\" Irreconcilable differences In the past years of negotiating, the differences between Israel and the Palestinians have simply been too big for the two sides to reach a lasting conclusion Martin Beck, head of the Konrad-Adenauer Stiftung Jordan office ,says that lack of agreement has a lot to do with Israel's settlement policies. \"In granting the construction of new settlements, Israel has demonstrated an unwillingness to comply with Palestinian demands,\" the Middle East expert told Deutsche Welle. And as Palestinian politician Kaddoura Fares said in an interview on Israeli radio there can be no peace while settlement building continued. \"When Israel has a different government or when the current government changes its policy and is willing to sit down at the negotiating table and stop construction, it will see that Abbas is open to peace,\" he said. Other side of the coin But Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liebermann rejects the call to suddenly stop what he says has been going on since 1993. \"The demand of Mahmud Abbas to end construction as a condition to peace is new,\" he said on army radio. \"He negotiated with Sharon and Olmert without attaching that condition. This is the first government to be confronted with it.\" As Martin Beck explains, settlements are only one factor in the complex mix. He cites the Palestinian bid for UN membership as another issue. \"In applying to be recognized as a state based on 1967 boundaries, the Palestinians have proved they want far more than Israel is willing to offer,\" Beck said. \"And that is not a good start for bilateral negotiations.\" Low expectations The situation took on a new twist earlier this month when the conflicted parties agreed to what many Israelis see as a grossly imbalanced prisoner exchange - one Israeli soldier for roughly 1,000 Palestinians. Yariv Oppenheimer, General Secretary of the Israeli NGO Peace Now, sees both the exchange and the speech Abbas delivered to the United Nations as hurdles to possible peace talks. \"It now looks as though Israel and Hamas are walking hand in hand,\" Oppenheimer said. \"But Netanyahu has been playing power games with Abbas ever since he was elected and that is a shame because he is more moderate than previous leaders.\" Lack of interest There is no mistaking the lack of importance Israel places on indirect negotiations. In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Israeli Minister of Improvement of Government Services confessed to knowing nothing about the planned talks. And the subject has not received much attention in the Israeli media either. The Palestinians are equally skeptical. \"I expect nothing,\" Nabil Schaat, a member of the Palestinian team of negotiators said shortly before the talks in Jerusalem. Middle East expert Martin Beck agrees that such skepticism is well-founded. \"Direct, bilateral peace talks with no clear schedule or parameters are hugely problematic for the Palestinians,\" he said. \"That was the way things went between 1993 and 2010, but compared to the PLO, Israel is just too powerful to have to make real concessions.\" Author: Hans Spross/ tkw Editor: Rob Mudge",

"story": "Opinion: Ukraine heads back to the old system There's a new head of government in Ukraine, but the trust in the system's ability to change is waning. The old boys' club and old patterns of behavior have returned, writes DW's Bernd Johann. Volodymyr Groysman nearly didn't make it to the post of Ukraine's prime minster. Arguments over the candidates for ministry positions blocked the election of the country's new head of government for days. President Poroshenko's plan to propel his close confidante to the position of prime minister came up against stiff opposition in the coalition government, especially after Poroshenko's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Groysman himself voted against candidates for ministry posts in order to push through his own people. In the end, the president got what he wanted: Groysman, previously the speaker of parliament, became prime minister. But it's not the liberating event it might have been. While it has spared the country the dissolution of parliament and a new round of elections, the reformers in Kyiv did not emerge as victors from the power struggle. Back to pre-Maidan times Two years after the cries for a democratic revolution reverberated out of Maidan Square, the old opaque patterns of political business have returned to Ukraine. Real issues have been put on the back burner; what counts is power and position. The broad governing coalition of many parties - a symbol of hope for a European Ukraine in the greater community - has been shattered. The old boys' club is emerging once again, as is nepotism, as politicians and wealthy oligarchs alike resort to pulling the strings behind the scenes. Poroshenko himself belongs to this club. Even as president, he has not yet removed himself from his company as he'd promised to do. The Panama Papers renewed the pressure on him to do this. Groysman also became politically important thanks to Poroshenko. The new head of government was the mayor of Vinnytsia before he came to politics in Kyiv via the president's party. Vinnytsia is also home to one of Poroshenko's chocolate factories and is the political home of the president. An indication that the old boys' club remains intact. No more excuses for Poroshenko Poroshenko forced the resignation of Arseniy Yatsenyuk as prime minister, turning him into a scapegoat for the failings of the government. Now, with his own man presiding over Ukraine, the president will have no excuses in te future for procrastinating with reforms. When will the day for decentralization come, which is supposed to give greater individual responsibility and rights to the country's regions? When will the judicial system finally be reformed to rid it of corruption? Hundreds of government-run companies must be privatized in order to attract investors and put more money in the country's coffers. Bankruptcy is still a looming threat. All of these projects have been pushed back in Kyiv, including the search for a compromise in resolving the war in Donbass, a war forced on Ukraine by Russia. Prime Minister Groysman has no time for dithering. The weeks-long government crisis gambled away a lot of time and faith in the government. Both domestically and in the West, the question is being asked just how willing the new cabinet will be toward instituting reforms - and rightfully so. That those energetic reformers in the former government are no longer a part of the process is not a good sign. Have something to say? Add your comments below.",

"story": "Cambodia: New Asian tiger thrives amid autocracy Hun Sen, Cambodia\u2019s prime minister and Asia\u2019s longest ruling leader is hosting the World Economic Forum on Asia and more than 700 delegates just weeks before an election. Manuela Kasper-Claridge reports from Phnom Penh. \"Cambodia is more capitalistic than the United States,\" says Tassilio Brinzer and enjoys how surprised his conversational partner is to hear that. Brinzer, a man in his late forties sits at a beautiful wooden table with a freshly brewed beer in front of him. Behind him, some people are shooting pool. \"Hops\", as it is called, serves Cambodian and Asian dishes but also Bratwurst and Currywurst. It is located in the central part of Cambodia's capital Phnom Penh. Outside, the traffic is roaring and Brinzer is visibly pleased with his pub. He even brought a master brewer in from Germany. Brinzer has been living in Cambodia for many years. Aside from his pub, he owns a restaurant, an advertising publishing company and three magazines. \"Fifteen years ago, there wasn't a single building here that was higher than 5 stories,\" he says. \"Look around now!\" Cambodia's success stories and its tragic personal stories There is a new building being constructed at almost every corner. Stylish apartments with balconies are going up, as are commercial buildings with several dozen floors. The construction boom is driven by Chinese money and an economic boom that is almost unparalleled. During the past ten years, the Cambodian economy has grown by at least 7 percent year after year. That makes the South East Asian country one ofthe fastest growing economies in the world. But there are no signs of widespread wealth. Many people continue to be desperately poor. Especially in rural areas farmers can barely live on what their harvest provides. The average income is $1,200 per year. But it is important to remember that the state of the country had been catastrophic. It started with the reign of terror that the Khmer Rouge unleashed between 1975 and 1979 when they essentially tried to take the country back to the Stone Age. More than 2 million people were murdered or died of hunger and disease. What followed were years of civil war, which didn't really end completely until the mid-1990s. The heart of ASEAN Few remnants of the past are visible in the capital. There are modern street cafes, which serve baguettes or macarons, and you can find restaurants from US fast food chains throughout the city. Their offerings complement the many street food stands, which sell homemade Asian specialties at little plastic tables. \"It is much easier to set up a business in Cambodia than in Vietnam or Thailand,\" stresses Ratana Phurik-Callebaut, Executive Director of the European Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia. All that is required is a deposit of $2,000 at a bank as a security, then you can get started, she adds. And companies can be 100 percent foreign-owned. \"We are well located, we are in the heart of ASEAN.\" Education is the key But there reasons why foreign companies aren't founding subsidiaries here in droves. Compared to neighboring Vietnam or Thailand, the country is relatively small. There are a little less than 16 million people here and many of them lack a decent education. \"After all, the Khmer Rouge killed all the teachers back then and then the doctors, the nurses, the accountants and many more,\" says Tassilo Brinzer, who is married to a Cambodian woman. \"Almost every family lost several people. A quarter of the population - and especially the educated ones - were practically annihilated.\" The repercussions of this genocide can still be felt today. On many buildings there are posters with job offers for well-trained people. It is difficult to fill positions, say entrepreneurs. What is easy, however, is to find unskilled labor and it will probably take at least one more generation until the level of education among the population is reasonably good. The emergence of a middle class Tassilo Brinzer is familiar with the complaints because he runs the working group \"German business,\" which has 28 members including Porsche, Bayer and DHL. His colleague from the European Chamber of Commerce thinks that Cambodia mainly has an image problem. \"Foreign companies don't know much about Cambodia. They just think about the past but we see here even the emergence of a middle class,\" she emphasizes and goes on to mention several positive figures. The fact that the World Economic Forum on Asia is convening in Phnom Penh from May 10 through 12 is generally viewed as the achievement of prime minister Hun Sen who has been ruling the country with an iron fist for 32 years. His liberal economic course has boosted growth but critics see no cause for celebration. They talk about human rights violations and growing corruption. In June, Hun Sen is up for re-election. He continues to see his country as closely allied with China, both politically and economically.

"story": "Russia, Brexit and Aleppo loom over year-end EU summit EU leaders are facing a \"minefield\" of crises in their final Brussels summit of 2016. Leaders appear split on extending sanctions against Russia, approving a Ukraine deal, responses to Aleppo and Brexit negotiations. European Union leaders and heads of state gathered in Brussels on Thursday for a one-day summit to discuss what European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has dubbed the bloc's \"poly-crisis\" - or several interlinking crises. \"This time we are dealing with a poly-crisis,\" Juncker told German public broadcaster ZDF on Wednesday ahead of the summit. \"It is burning all over the place - not just in European corners.\" The EU leaders are set to discuss extending sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine, as well as a contentious deal with the Ukraine which is opposed by the Netherlands. \"We are treading on a minefield, there are so many issues on the agenda that still can go wrong,\" a senior EU official told news agency AFP ahead of the summit. Brexit talks In the evening, 27 EU leaders will hold an informal working dinner without British Prime Minister Theresa May where they will try to present a united front on negotiations for the United Kingdom's departure from the EU. Prior to that meeting, May will join the other leaders to discuss the other contentious issues. \"We want that to be as smooth and orderly a process as possible. It is not just in our interests, it is in the interests of Europe as well,\" she said on Thursday as she arrived at the summit. EU leaders have insisted that there can be no Brexit discussions with the UK until May formally starts the divorce process, slated to last two years. She has said Britain intends on triggering Article 50 by the end of March next year. Split on sanctions extension The bloc is expected on Thursday to renew sanctions against Russia over its actions in eastern Ukraine and the stalled implementation of the Minsk peace deal. Some EU leaders, however, have criticized the extensions, with Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico calling the plan \"senseless.\" The Slovakian leader, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said that both Russia and Ukraine have been delinquent in fulfilling the peace accord. \"Both states still have a lot to do. Our black-and-white view is dangerous and bad,\" Fico said before parliament in Bratislava on Wednesday. Earlier this week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande said they support sanction extensions. Juncker also opposed instating new sanctions against Moscow over its actions in Syria, saying the move would \"not influence\" Russia. Concerning the current humanitarian crisis in Aleppo and the situation in Syria, Juncker also deflected criticism that the EU should have sent soldiers to intervene, adding that he did not believe \"that there are many Europeans who want to die because of Syria.\" However, Juncker expects European leaders at the summit to examine \"all available options\" for a humanitarian solution to the deadly conflict. EU-Ukraine deal on thin ice One of the most urgent issues facing EU leaders is a stalled agreement for political and commercial ties between the bloc and Ukraine. Without agreement at this summit, the deal is in danger of falling through. Dutch voters rejected the so-called association agreement with Kyiv at a referendum back in April. As a result of this, the Netherlands is the only EU member state that has not yet ratified the agreement and wants to clarify that the deal does not put Ukraine on the path to EU membership. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said he was \"a bit more optimistic\" on Thursday that his fellow leaders would back proposed amendments to the deal. \"I'm motivated to get this done,\" Rutte told reporters. \"I do this because we are deeply convinced that we cannot risk European unity towards Russia.\" rs/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

"story": "Suspect charged in London Tube stabbing A man has been charged with attempted murder after injuring two people in a knife attack at a London Underground station. Officers have also discovered images associated with the \"Islamic State\" on his phone. The suspect in Saturday's knife attack in a London Underground metro station appeared in court on Monday after being charged with attempted murder by counterterrorism officers. Muhaydin Mire, 29, spoke in London's Westminster Magistrates' Court only to confirm his age, name and address. Witnesses said Mire brandished a knife at the East London station of Leytonstone on Saturday and shouted \"This is for Syria\" while attacking a man. \"It was a violent, sustained and unprovoked attack during which the victim was punched, knocked to the ground and repeatedly kicked on the ground,\" said prosecutor David Cawthorne. Police detained the assailant at the scene after using a stun gun. Prosecutors also announced on Monday that images of flags connected to the so-called militant group \"Islamic State\" (IS) were found on the suspect's cellphone. They alleged that the attack was an act of terrorism. Two men were injured during the attack, with one 56-year-old man suffering a 12-centimeter (5-inch) neck wound. The injury was serious but not life-threatening, and the man is recovering after five hours of surgery. The second man, a 33-year-old, was lightly injured. \"It's obviously a hideous attack, and we've all seen pictures about it and read about it,\" British Prime Minister David Cameron told reporters on Monday. \"Full credit to the person and people who took on this attacker and full credit to the very brave police officers who managed to subdue him.\" Mire is set to appear in London's central criminal court on Friday. #YouAintNoMulsimBruv The aftermath of the attack was recorded by bystanders and published on several social media sites. One onlooker shouted the phrase: \"You ain't no Muslim, bruv! You're no Muslim, bruv! You ain't no Muslim!\" It has since become a trending hashtag on social media. Cameron also praised the bystander, saying: \"Some of us have dedicated speeches and media appearances and sound bites and everything to this subject, but 'you ain't no Muslim, bruv' said it all much better than I could have done.\" In response to Saturday's attack, police in London have increased patrols in the Underground system to \"identify and deter terrorism.\" Increased patrols will \"involve both uniformed and plain-clothed officers, supported by other resources, such as armed officers, police dogs, a network of CCTV cameras and the thousands of rail staff we work alongside,\" said Mark Newton, a transport police spokesman. \"We ask the public to remain calm and carry on using public transport as normal.\" The attack comes just days after the British Parliament approved airstrikes on IS targets in Syria. rs/cmk (AP, AFP, Reuters)",

"story": "Eurozone inflation still in 'danger zone' in June Annual inflation in the 18-member eurozone has remained at levels far too low to disperse protracted deflation worries in the bloc. Adjusted ECB forecasts see the problem lingering on for years. Annual eurozone inflation remained at just 0.5 percent in June, initial figures from the EU statistics office, Eurostat, showed Monday. The figure marked the ninth consecutive month that consumer prices stayed well below what the European Central Bank had called a \"danger zone\" of under 1 percent. Rises in energy and services costs were easily offset by falling food, alcohol and tobacco prices, Eurostat noted. No reason to panic The ECB insisted that despite the June stagnation there was no acute risk of outright deflation in the 9.6-trillion euro ($13.1 trillion) economy, although three individual member countries had experienced deflation in May. Analysts had penciled in a slight rise in the annual cost of living after the ECB cut interest rates to an historic low in an effort to tackle low inflation. The bloc's central bank had lowered its long-term forecast for eurozone inflation, predicting that it would reach 1.4 percent in 2016, still off the bank's own target of below, but close to 2 percent. hg/rs (dpa, Reuters)",

"story": "Ex-KGB spy Litvinenko's autopsy 'world's most dangerous' Pathologists in the UK carried out one of the most dangerous autopsies when cutting into former KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko, an inquiry heard. The former agent died in 2006 after he drank tea poisoned with polonium. The post-mortem of former KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko was \"one of the most dangerous\" ever, according to experts speaking in London on Wednesday. Litvinenko, who is believed to have been poisoned with radioactive polonium-210, died on November 23, 2006. \"It has been described as one of the most dangerous post-mortem examinations ever undertaken in the Western world,\" Nathaniel Cary, one of the pathologists inquiring into Litvinenko's case told the Associated Press. Those involved in the investigation had to wear white protective suits with specialized hoods that supplied filtered air. Inquiry into former spy's death Litvinenko suddenly fell ill in November 2006 after drinking tea with two Russians he met at a London hotel. The former spy's death deteriorated rapidly after the meeting and he died within three weeks of multiple organ failure. Litvinenko was living in exile in London as a former KGB agent who had become a critic of the Kremlin. In the inquiry into Litvinenko's killing, which started on Tuesday, police said Litvinenko suspected Russian President Vladimir Putin of personally ordering his death. The reason was to cover up Kremlin's link with the mafia, which Litvinenko was helping Spanish intelligence expose, Reuters news agency reported the Litvinenko family lawyer as saying. Two police suspects, Dmitry Kovtun and Andrei Lugovoi, are still officially wanted for murder. The pair, however, have denied involvement in Litvinenko's death and Russia has so far refused to extradite them. They have been invited to speak at the inquiry via video link, but cannot be forced to do so. Lugovoi denounces UK investigation Meanwhile, Lugovoi told the Associated Press that the evidence being presented at the inquiry was \"nonsense.\" \"Such evidence simply does not exist because Russia wasn't involved,\" he said. Lugovoi also accused the inquiry of trying to cover up a possible involvement of the British intelligence agency MI6. The controversy generated by Litvinenko's killing severely impacted UK-Russian relations. An inquiry was delayed after London's ties improved with Kremlin, but the Ukraine crisis last year prompted Britain to commence the proceedings. mg/sms (Reuters, AP)",

"story": "Two deadly explosions rock Mogadishu Two explosions have rocked the center of Mogadishu. A Somali police official confirmed that gunmen have also forced their way into a prestigious hotel in the Somali capital. Eyewitnesses reported that the first of the two blasts could be heard 15 kilometers (10 miles) outside of the city on Friday. It reportedly took place at a central hotel in the city and was accompanied by heavy gunfire. A second explosion was later confirmed by a government employee. Residents reported a large plume of smoke rising above the city. Police said a suicide bomber had rammed his car into the SYL hotel's entrance at 7:45 p.m. local time (1645 GMT) and that a number of gunmen had then entered the premises after an exchange of gunfire with hotel guards. There was no definitive information on casualties but the German news agency dpa reported that at least 20 people had died, citing a local government spokesman. Several more were wounded, it said. Police Major Ahmad Ismail told the Reuters news agency that it remained unclear whether the fighters were still inside the hotel. Al-Shabab claims responsibility The SYL hotel, also known as the Somali Youth League hotel, is located across from the presidential palace in Mogadishu and is frequented by government officials and business executives. The Islamic extremist al-Shabab group, which is affiliated with the al Qaeda terrorist network, claimed responsibility for the attack. Earlier this month, the group attempted to bomb a Daallo airlines flight en route from Mogadishu to Djibouti. The blast tore a gaping hole to the plane's fuselage and sucked the attacker out of the plane. Al-Shabab carries out attacks government facilities in Mogadishu on a regular basis, seeking to establish an Islamist state in Somalia. ss/sms (AFP, AP, Reuters)",

"story": "Spain looks into whether US broke the law with NSA eavesdropping Spain has opened an investigation into US eavesdropping on telephone calls. The White House may stop eavesdropping on friendly foreign leaders as the US confronts a flood of revelations about its spying practices. Spain's probe comes amid outrage over revelations that the US snooped on the communications of millions in Europe, including leaders such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The probe aims to find signs that a criminal offense took place, which individuals prosecutors could hold accountable and whether any infractions fall within Spain's jurisdiction, a spokesman for the public prosecutor's office said on Tuesday. Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia Margallo said that if the reported espionage proved true \"it could mean a break in the climate of trust that has traditionally reigned in relations between the two countries.\" On Monday, Spain's El Mundo newspaper published a classified document purportedly showing that the US security services tracked 60.5 million Spanish telephone calls in a single month as part of a worldwide espionage program that has enraged Europe. According to El Mundo, the National Security Agency (NSA) recorded the origin and destination of the calls and their duration but not the content. The newspaper printed a classified graph showing 30 days of monitoring through to January 8. The journalist Glenn Greenwald, who says he has access to previously secret documents obtained by former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, contributed to the article. Reports based on new leaks from the former NSA systems analyst indicate that the NSA listened to Merkel and 34 other foreign leaders. El Mundo urged prosecutors to charge the NSA with spying, calling monitoring of telephone calls without the proper judicial authority a criminal offense. Spain summoned the US ambassador Monday to the Foreign Ministry to discuss the spying allegations and called on Washington to provide \"all necessary information\" about the alleged phone tapping. 'Risks and rewards' On Monday, White House spokesman Jay Carney used a press conference to respond to criticism about the latest allegations of spying on European allies. Carney said monitoring electronic communications was a key part of protecting American citizens in a world that was becoming increasingly interconnected. \"If we're going to keep our citizens and our allies safe, we have to continue to stay ahead of these changes, and that's what our intelligence community has been doing extraordinarily well,\" Carney said. In light of outrage in Europe over reports that the NSA had tapped German Chancellor Merkel's phone, among other allegations, Carney conceded that the United States may have to rethink some of its intelligence activities. \"We ... need to ensure that our intelligence resources are most effectively supporting our foreign policy and national security objectives, that we are more effectively weighing the risks and rewards of our activities,\" he said. Meanwhile, Diane Feinstein, who chairs the US Senate's intelligence committee, has said that she would launch what she described as \"a major review into all intelligence collection programs.\" In a statement, the Democrat from California said that the White House had informed her that \"collection on our allies will not continue.\" mkg/rc (Reuters, AFP, dpa, AP)",

"story": "Leverkusen, Schalke draw in unproductive match Leverkusen and Schalke played out an unproductive draw, exchanging goals in the second half. Both sides have hit a rut in form, and there were few signs either side is close to climbing out of it. Leverkusen 1-1 Schalke (Choupo-Moting 50' - Riether o.g. 85') Sometimes, the undecisive result of a draw can be a positive, allowing each team to leave with something from a match. In Leverkusen on Sunday though, the exact opposite was true as both sides suffered yet another setback in their respective Bundesliga campaigns. Both Leverkusen and Schalke came into the match stuck in neutral, unable to shift into gear while slipping further away from their ultimate goal of a Champions League spot. This showcase did not help either team get out of their funks as a 1-1 draw pins both outside of the top four. Finishing was a major issue for the two teams despite excellent runs up and down the field from Schalke's Max Meyer and Leverkusen's Kevin Kampl. The home side only put four of their 11 first-half shots on target, while Schalke were only able to fire away three after losing the ball in pivotal moments. The best chance of the first 45 minutes came for Leverkusen, rattling the bar after squirming in from the right flank. First magestry, then misfortune Though the first half was pretty open, Schalke's approach was more delicate, trying to push forward on the break to steal a goal away from home. Their patience was rewarded shortly after the restart, with Leon Goretzka slipping through a ball to Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, who finished neatly. It was Schalke's first lead in 410 minutes, and one they desperately needed. Andre Breitenreiter then pulled back his men and made two defensive substitutions to try to kill off the match. His side has not had recent success in big matches, losing to Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, Borussia Dortmund, and Bayern Munich all in the last month. His blockade held up for most of the second half, but fortune was not on Schalke's side. Chicharito helped give Leverkusen the equalizer, clanging a through ball from Kevin Kampl off of an unaware Sasha Riether. The own goal bailed Leverkusen out of another deflating result in less than a week. A point is what both sides ended with, but it was accompanied by the knowledge that staying in the top 10 rather than focusing on the top four has now become the priority. Wolfsburg drop points in Augsburg Goals were a plenty for Wolfsburg a week ago, but the goal reservoir dried up on their trip to Augsburg. The hosts club came to play, and even had a penalty shout in the first half. Wolfsburg could not make an imprint on the match until the second half, but were still short of their best. Matters got worse when Dante received his second yellow card in the second half, but that didn't change the result. A week after closing the gap, Wolfsburg have now lost ground on second-placed Dortmund.",

"story": "Union: Alitalia closes on cash injection to stay in the skies Trade union officials have said Italian airline Alitalia is approaching a half-billion-euro cash injection, after reports that the company was days from bankruptcy. Alitalia came close to the brink as recently as 2008. Union representatives met with Alitalia management in Rome on Wednesday, discussing the future of an airline that's thought to need around 500 million euros ($675 million) in fresh capital to stay afloat. Claudio Tarlazzi of the UIL Trasporti union said after the talks that stakeholders were considering a capital increase of 300 million euros, coupled with a loan of 200 million euros, to raise the funds. Tarlazzi said Alitalia would seek half its capital injection from a public sector investor, and half from company shareholders. Another union representative said a public investor like Fintecna, a public holding in property and shipyards, might prove a viable investor. \"Alitalia is desperately seeking help before it fails,\" Franco Nasso from the Filt Cgil union said. \"Either the continuity of the company is assured within 48 hours by deciding which public sector subject should be brought in or we have to accept a bankruptcy steered by Paris.\" Alitalia's most pressing immediate concern is an outstanding bill for around 30 million euros payable to its fuel supplier, Eni. Chief executive Paolo Scaroni has said that kerosene supplies will be shut off on Saturday, because Eni \"cannot provide credit to a company whose future seems no longer assured.\" Further emergency talks are scheduled on Thursday, and Friday if necessary, for the Italian flagship carrier that employs roughly 14,000 people. Still almost all-Italian, but at what cost? Alitalia has not made an annual operating profit since its privatization and restructuring - itself a rescue mission for the once state-owned carrier - was completed in 2009. Under the terms of that deal, Air France-KLM acquired a 25-percent share in the company. Air France-KLM this week announced a restructuring plan of its own affecting at least 2,800 employees. Italy's prime minister at the time, Silvio Berlusconi, rejected the French-Dutch carrier's attempts to buy a controlling stake. German giant Lufthansa had also expressed an interest in the early stages of talks. One of Berlusconi's campaign promises in 2008 had been to save the airline, and to keep it Italian. It took a change in Italy's bankruptcy laws to entice domestic investors to purchase only those elements of the business with a chance at survival. The airline's liabilities and debts were turned into a \"bad company\" that remained in state and taxpayer hands. A classified US diplomatic cable on the topic, sent from the embassy in Rome and released in 2011, was given the subject-line: \"Alitalia still flies under the Italian flag but at a high cost to Italy.\" The same cable concluded that the \"new Alitalia,\" officially called Cai (Compagnia Aerea Italia), \"still faces an uphill battle to return to profitability and to convince ordinary Italians and opposition politicians that the cost was worth it.\" Prime Minister Enrico Letta at the weekend described Berlusconi's handling of Alitalia's last escape from bankruptcy, finalized late in 2008 ahead of a January 2009 official relaunch, as an error \"that we are paying for today.\" msh/lw (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

"story": "Muslims in France, Italy join Catholic mass to mourn French priest Muslims in France have attended Catholic mass in churches and cathedrals across the country in a show of solidarity following the gruesome murder of a French priest. Interfaith services were also held in Italy. Dozens of Muslims were among the faithful who packed into the Gothic cathedral in the town of Rouen, northern France, on Sunday. Policemen and soldiers stood guard outside, seeking to reassure a jittery community five days after two jihadi teenagers killed an 85-year-old priest inside a church just a few kilometers away in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray. \"This morning we extend a special welcome to our Muslim friends,\" Rouen Archbishop Dominique Lebrun said in his homily. \"I thank you in the name of all Christians. In this way you are affirming that you reject death and violence in the name of God.\" A number of Muslim leaders attended the service, along with three nuns who were at the church in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray when Father Jacques Hamel was brutally murdered at the altar. The killing gave rise to questions about lapses in security after it was reported that both 19-year-old offenders were known to authorities and had attempted to reach Syria. There were also fears the attack could create possible tensions between the religions and add to divisions in French society. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls on Sunday called for a new \"pact\" with the country's 5 million Muslims, which make up the largest Muslim population in Europe. \"Islam has found its place in France... contrary to the repeated attacks of populists on the right and far-right,\" he said, calling for the rejection of Islam to be combatted \"with the greatest strength.\" Churches in other French cities also opened their doors to Muslims on Sunday. Dalil Boubakeur, the rector of the Mosque of Paris, was among those who attended a service in the capital's iconic Notre Dame cathedral. \"The situation is serious,\" he told broadcaster BFMTV. \"Time has come to come together so as not to be divided.\" Multifaith services were held across Italy too, notably at Rome's Santa Maria di Trastevere church. In Naples, Abdullah Cozzolino from Italy's Islamic Confederation spoke in the Treasure of St. Gennaro chapel next to the Duomo cathedral, stressing the \"need of dialogue, more affirmation of shared values of peace, of solidarity, of love, out of respect for our one God, merciful and compassionate.\" nm/ rc(AP, AFP)",

"story": "New floating objects spotted as stormy weather grounds aircraft searching for MH370 Thailand has said its satellite images showed 300 floating objects near the search zone in the southern Indian Ocean. Meanwhile, thunderstorms and strong winds have forced search teams to temporarily suspend operations. Thailand said on Thursday it could have a lead on possible wreckage from missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, according to media reports. Its latest satellite images revealed roughly 300 floating objects, ranging from two to 15 meters (6.6 to 50 feet) in size. The images pointed to an area some 2,700 kilometers southwest of Perth, within the zone where officials believe the plane crashed after losing contact with air traffic control on March 8. Search halted Earlier Thursday, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) cancelled reconnaissance flights to Thursday's search zone in the southern Indian Ocean after severe weather forecasts proved too dangerous. The suspension grounded six military planes and five civilian aircraft participating in the search and rescue operation for the missing Boeing 777. The aircraft were in the air \"maybe two hours,\" ASMA spokesperson Sam Cardwell said. \"They got a bit of time in, but it was not useful because there was no visibility.\" Five ships would remain out at sea for the time being, ASMA confirmed. Rescuers on Thursday had been scheduled to reach the search zone where satellite images had spotted 122 \"potential objects,\" which Malaysian officials said they believed could be wreckage from MH370. AMSA had issued a similar suspension earlier in the week, a move which sparked protests in Beijing. Distraught family members of the missing passengers marched on the Malaysian embassy, demanding more answers from officials. Two-thirds of the passengers on board MH370 were Chinese nationals. Logistical problems The international search team - relying on logistical support form the US, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand - is tasked with searching an area of 1.6 million square kilometers (622,000 square miles), which is roughly the size of Iran. Not only have poor weather conditions impeded search efforts, but the remoteness of the area has also made the recovery of any possible debris extremely difficult.

"story": "Bangladeshi Hindus seeking safety in India The number of Hindus living in Bangladesh continues to shrink as many of them leave to seek refuge in neighboring India. Experts blame it on religious persecution and systematic oppression against the minority community. Ananda Gopal Ganguly left his home early in the morning on Tuesday, June 7, to offer morning prayers. But the 70-year-old priest didn't reach his destination. Farmers later discovered his dead body near his home in the southwestern city of Jhenidah. This is the latest in a string of attacks on minorities by suspected Islamists in the South Asian nation. More than 40 people have been killed by Islamic extremists in recent years, and most of the victims belong to minority communities. Over the past four decades, the number of Hindus living in the Muslim-majority country has declined from 13.5 percent to 8.5 percent, according to Bangladeshi government data. The latest census, conducted in 2011, showed nearly a million Hindus disappeared from the country between 2001 and 2011. Insecurity and discrimination Mainstream political parties have failed to protect religious minorities in the country, says Rana Dasgupta, the general secretary of the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (BHBCUC). \"The Hindu community living here has been facing persecution ever since the partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947, first in what was then East Pakistan until 1971. And the situation didn't change much even after the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent nation,\" Dasgupta told DW. In the decades following its independence, Bangladesh witnessed a number of attacks on the Hindu community. For instance, in the aftermath of the demolition of the Babri mosque in India in 1992, over 200 Hindu temples were destroyed in Bangladesh by Islamic fundamentalists. Many Hindu families were also attacked by extremists at that time. Furthermore, violence against Hindu communities is common at the time of elections, as a consequence of political parties using polarizing rhetoric against minorities in their attempt to garner votes. Dasgupta blames religious fundamentalists, particularly the supporters of Bangladesh's largest Islamic party, Jamaat-e-Islami, for attacks on the Hindu community, saying that the party's loyalists were found to be the perpetrators of many of the assaults. Jyotirmoy Barua, a lawyer and human rights activist, believes Hindus in Bangladesh are not getting enough support from the state, which is making them even more vulnerable in their own land. \"In most cases, we see that the main reason behind the attacks on Hindus is disputes over land ownership,\" he told DW, adding that law enforcement agencies are failing to protect the rights of minorities in the country. \"Attacks on the minority community are also carried out by workers of the ruling party, the Awami League. For that reason, Hindus feel helpless and the government is silent on this issue for long,\" Barua noted. Seeking refuge Around 750 people from minority communities, on average, are leaving Bangladesh every day, reveals research conducted by Abul Barkat, an economist and professor at Dhaka University. Most of them cross the border to seek refuge in neighboring India. Although many believe Bangladeshi Hindus mainly move to India for economic reasons, BHBCUC expert Dasgupta disagrees. \"Security is the main reason behind their decision to leave Bangladesh. If the government ensures their safety, they will not leave the country,\" he stressed. Meanwhile, the Indian government is planning to change its citizenship law - to exempt Hindus of Bangladesh and Pakistan who have fled to India out of fear of religious persecution from being tagged as \"illegal migrants.\" The move could make it easier for them to obtain Indian passports in the future. Dasgupta also said that mainstream political parties in Hindu-majority India have always expressed their support to Bangladeshi Hindus, pointing to the Indian Home Minister Rajnath Singh's recent assertion that \"Bangladeshi minorities who have taken refuge in India to escape persecution would be granted citizenship.\" The problem with 'state religion' But leaving Bangladesh is not a solution for the Hindu community, underlines Dasgupta. The rights activist calls on the nation's government, led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, to scale up its efforts to protect Hindus and prevent attacks from both Islamists and politicians alike. \"Bangladesh's constitution is not secular. It has a state religion, which is biased toward a specific religion. It won't be possible to ensure safety and security of minorities in the country without dropping state religion from the constitution,\" argued Dasgupta. Lawyer Barua also echoed a similar opinion. He stresses that the mainstream Muslim community needs to play an active role to protect the rights of all other religious groups in the country. \"No law will be enough to protect the country's Hindus, Christians, Buddhists and Ahmadis, if the Muslims do not resist such extremist acts.\"",

"story": "Pope Urges Bush to Find Peaceful Solution in Middle East After a brief stop in Poland Friday to discuss plans basing a US defense missile system there, US President George W. Bush traveled to Rome, where Pope Benedict XVI. urged him to help end violence in the Middle East. Not many people can lecture US President George W Bush and get away with it. Pope Benedict XVI appeared to do just that on Saturday during his first meeting with Bush as head of the Roman Catholic Church. According to an official statement published shortly after their 35-minute talk, the Vatican said the pope had \"expressed his concern\" for the situation facing Christian communities in Iraq, Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian territories. More importantly, the German-born pontiff had asked Bush to find \"negotiated\" solutions to the conflicts afflicting the Middle East. Put in simple language, he told Bush off for going to war in Iraq and for resorting to military options to resolve crises. Bush in \"listening mode\" Bush had of course been made fully aware of the Holy See's strong opposition to the war during his last encounter with the late John Paul II three years ago and said he would be heading to the Vatican in \"a listening mode. \"He's a good thinker and a smart man,\" Bush told reporters ahead of Saturday's meeting. Experts note that while the former theology professor may have a softer, more \"academic\" style than his charismatic predecessor, their views on the subject are substantially the same. Benedict used to act as John Paul's main advisor while still a cardinal and made his opinion on Iraq very clear in April, when he said in his Easter message that \"nothing positive comes from Iraq.\" Common ground In actual fact, Bush may have found much common ground with Benedict than the disagreement on how to tackle the Middle East might suggest. Speaking to reporters, papal spokesman Federico Lombardi said the two leaders had agreed on a variety of issues, ranging from religious freedom to \"the defense and promotion of life, matrimony and the family.\" Benedict, who often reminds politicians that the Church considers life sacred \"from conception,\" will certainly have approved of Bush's opposition to abortion and his threat to veto a recently-approved US bill expanding federally funded embryonic stem cell research. \"Yes, Sir\" And apart from raising eyebrows by repeatedly addressing the pope as \"Sir\" rather than using the more formal term \"Your Holiness,\" Bush did not travel to the Vatican empty-handed either. On top of the traditional exchanging of gifts - Bush gave Benedict a white stick with the 10 commandments carved on it, the work of a Texan artist - the president was also able to provide assurances about his commitment to combat poverty and the spread of AIDS in Africa. \"I've got a very strong AIDS initiative,\" Bush said, referring to his efforts to convince Congress to double US spending for combating AIDS in Africa to $30 billion (22.2 billion euros) over the next five years. Facing protests After meeting the pope, Bush saw Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi. Heavy security measures were in force, with some 10,000 police including hundreds in riot gear and scores of armored vehicles deployed. Two separate protests, one by the left flank of Prodi's fractious ruling coalition and the other by more hardline anti-US campaigners, were planned Saturday afternoon under sunny skies. Prodi has asked government members of the Refoundation Communist, Italian Communist and Green parties not to join the protest, while party leaders and lawmakers planned to attend. Italian Welfare Minister Paolo Ferrero of the Refoundation Communist party said Friday that he would not join the protest out of a \"sense of responsibility,\" while noting: \"Bush is a warmonger, I understand those who oppose him.\" CIA scandal The US leader's visit came the day after Council of Europe investigator Dick Marty released a report saying the CIA ran secret prisons in Poland and Romania from 2003 to 2005 to interrogate terror suspects under a program authorized by the countries' presidents. Also Friday, a trial opened in Milan over the kidnapping of a terror suspect in Washington's heavily criticized \"extraordinary rendition\" program. Twenty-five CIA agents are being tried in absentia for the kidnapping of Milan imam Osama Mustafa Hassan -- better known as Abu Omar -- and transferring him to a high-security prison outside Cairo, where he claims he was tortured.",

"story": "Investigators: Russian missile downed MH17 Investigators have released initial findings into the MH17 aviation disaster. It confirms earlier reports that a BUK mobile launcher fired the fatal missile from separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine. The doomed flight MH17 was shot down by a BUK surface-to-air missile trucked in from Russia, investigators said Wednesday. All 298 aboard were killed and evidence from communications intercepts, radar data and other material points to a military ground-to-air missile as the cause. The investigation has been headed by the Dutch prosecution service, but includes teams from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine. They publicly revealed their initial findings at a news conference in Nieuwegein, the Netherlands on Wednesday. Moscow has consisently denied allegations that pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine were responsible. On Monday, the Russian military said it has new radio-location data that show the missile that downed the Boeing 777 did not originate from rebel-controlled territory, and said it would turn that data over to investigators. \"First-hand radar data identified all flying objects which could have been launched or were in the air over the territory controlled by rebels at that moment,\" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. \"The data are clear-cut \u2026 there is no rocket. If there was a rocket, it could only have been fired from elsewhere,\" he added. However, Ukraine's foreign ministry described it as an \"important milestone,\" claiming that it discredits Moscow's narrative of the event. \"It is important to underline that the preliminary results of the criminal investigation have confirmed the findings of the technical report published last October by the Dutch Safety Board, namely, that the crash was caused by the explosion of a warhead launched from a 'BUK' anti-aircraft missile system,\" the statement said. \"This puts an end to all of Russia's attempts to discredit activities of the Joint Investigation Team and conclusions by spreading distorted or fabricated information,\" the ministry added. 'We want an answer' A separate inquiry led by the Dutch Safety Board (OVV) found the airliner was hit by a BUK missile fired from an area most likely held by separatists during the summer of 2014. It said that the BUK mobile launcher then returned to Russia. The criminal investigation is expected to shed light on the exact type of BUK missile used; the anti-aircraft weapon is manufactured by Russia, but stockpiles exist in the Ukrainian military as well. Relatives of the victims have long pushed for answers and transparency, and have been angered by the slow pace of information. \"Apart from wanting to know exactly what weapon was used and where it was fired from, we also want an answer as to where we go from here,\" said Evert van Zijtveld, chairman of the foundation that supports families of MH17 victims. Zijtveld lost his teenage son and daughter in the air disaster. Hostile working conditions The international investigation team faced extraordinary challenges throughout the probe: the crime scene in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk Oblast, where the plane crashed on July 17, 2014, was located in an active war zone, and during the days following the crash pro-Kremlin militants limited access to the site. Since then 11 containers crammed with debris from the jetliner were ultimately brought to the Netherlands. A research team took soil samples in eastern Ukraine and established the location of cellphone towers and the layout of the local telephone network. Forensic samples were taken from passengers' and crew members' bodies and luggage, and satellite data and communications intercepts were scrutinized. The team also appealed for information from witnesses who may have seen the missile launch. About two-thirds of the passengers aboard MH17 were Dutch nationals; the crew were Malaysian nationals. Malaysia had proposed setting up an international tribunal to try those responsible for the plane's destruction, but Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution in favor of such a tribunal The United States has welcomed the preliminary results of the inquiry into the downing of the flight. US State Department spokesman John Kirby said the inquiry left \"no doubt that MH17 was shot down by a BUK surface-to-air missile fired from territory in eastern Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists.\" Kirby said: \"We also note the joint investigation team's finding that the missile launcher was first brought into Ukraine from Russia and then moved out of Ukraine and back to Russia after the shoot-down.\" ls,jar/kl/jbh,kms (AP, AFP, dpa)",

"story": "An easy kick-off in German Cup, with scope for surprise The first round of the German Cup generally has a bit of a pre-season feel to it. Due to the seeding, the top division giants are guaranteed to face lower-league minnows. There's one drawback though: they all play away. A relative minnow in the top flight Bundesliga, last season's surprise package Augsburg is the first to take to the pitch in the German Cup on Friday night, traveling to lower league side Wilhelmshaven. Augsburg was the side that shocked everyone by surviving its first ever Bundesliga season last time out, then surprised them even more by ditching the majority of its coaching staff even after dodging the drop. The 17 remaining Bundesliga clubs will all travel to minnows playing below the German second division over the course of the weekend, along with 15 teams from the second division. The three sides that secured promotion to the Zweite Bundesliga last season are included in the \"amateur\" half of the 64-team draw. The first round of the cup is all about survival, as home crowds get to cheer on rank underdogs against their high-profile visitors. This system is not entirely designed to favor the established sides, which are hardly in need of charity; it's also meant to be a chance for tiny teams to rack up higher gate receipts at least once in a season. Upsets are rare, but by no means unprecedented. Last season, Felix Magath's Wolfsburg fell at the first hurdle versus Red Bull Leipzig, while Bayer Leverkusen lost to Dynamo Dresden and Freiburg were beaten by Unterhaching. Those results are very much the exceptions. It's more common to see a demolition job by the favorites. Schalke, who went on to secure third in the league last season, won their first round match against FC Teningen 11-1. Even a second division side, the admittedly strong Paderborn, put 10 goals past its first round opponents last time out. Potential upsets? Paderborn have a tougher draw this year for their Sunday game, facing Arminia Bielefeld - a side surprisingly relegated from the second division last season. Bielefeld were in the top German league just four seasons ago. On the subject of fallen giants, Karlsruhe now qualify for the \"amateur\" side of the draw and are liable to provide Hamburg with a relatively tough first round test on Sunday. These two sides last met in the Bundesliga in February 2009, with Karlsruhe winning 3-2 just a few months ahead of dropping out of the top division. Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, who have a tricky midweek Champions League qualifier against Dynamo Kyiv to worry about, could have drawn better too. They will travel to the Dutch border on Saturday to play Allemania Aachen, the third of a trio of shock second division rejects last season. German giants Bayern Munich take on Jahn Regensburg, one of the newly-promoted second division sides, in the last match of the weekend late on Monday evening. Augsburg's new coach Markus Weinzierl will be watching that game keenly; he led Regensburg to promotion last season. Bayern lost last year's final in Berlin, getting taken apart 5-2 by double-winners Borussia Dortmund.",

"story": "Astronomers discover Jupiter-like planet in a galaxy far, far away Scientists have discovered a new planet 1,500 light years away. Moderately cool and roughly the size of Jupiter, CoRoT-9b is a gem for researchers studying planets outside our solar system. Astronomers are thrilled with a new discovery: a planet the size of Jupiter and similar in structure to some of those orbiting our sun. The new orb has been dubbed CoRoT-9b, and lies 1,500 light years away from our solar system, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Berlin told the DPA news agency Wednesday. The newly discovered planet \u2013 named after the CoRoT space telescope that first discovered it \u2013 takes about 95 days to orbit its star, CoRoT-9, in the Serpens constellation. By comparison, it takes Mercury 88 days to orbit our sun. \"It's the first extrasolar planet where we are quite sure it is fairly similar to one in our own solar system, and it's the first extrasolar planet where we can test models that we have developed for solar system planets,\" lead researcher Hans Deeg of the Institute of Astrophysics on Spain's Atlantic archipelago of the Canary Islands, told AFP. However, those hoping the newly discovered sphere is a small, rocky planet with a breathable atmosphere and potable water are out of luck. CoRoT-9b is a giant gas ball with a mass about 80 percent of Jupiter. There is good news. Most \"Gas Jupiters,\" as they are known, have surface temperatures that can reach up to 1,800 degrees Celsius, due to their proximity to their suns. CoRoT-9b, on the other hand, has a relatively cool surface temperature of between -20 and 160 degrees Celsius, research published by the journal Nature states. \"This is the first (exoplanet) whose properties we can study in depth,\" Claire Moutou, one of 60 astronomers who took part in the discovery, told the AFP news agency. She added that \"it is bound to become a Rosetta Stone in exoplanet research.\" Research continues Researchers will likely continue to gather information about the planet, as it is one of only 70 such exoplanets that transit directly between the star and the telescope. This allows the star's light to pass through the planet's atmosphere, transmitting the telescope information about the planet's size and chemical composition. Something already discovered from such planetary observation, Deeg said, is that the variation in the types of planets that orbit close to their star is quite large. \"For instance, Venus was probably apt for life in its early phases before a greenhouse effect set in and elevated temperatures by several hundred degrees,\" he said. With this new discovery, understanding of the chemistry of low temperatures may grow so much that it could open up a completely new research field on atmospherically cool and moderate planets, Didier Queloz, co-author of the study, told DPA. \"Our explorations have yielded more information about CoRoT-9b, than ever discovered about any other exoplanets,\" Queloz added. An exoplanet is the name scientists give to planets outside our solar system. The first such planet was discovered in 1995, with more than 400 others found in the years since. ad/dpa/afp Editor: Mark Mattox",

"story": "Japan's nuclear mishap underlines industry malaise Japan's nuclear energy sector is riven by poor management, is overly bureaucratic and staffed by people who no longer have any pride in their jobs. So accidents are inevitable, say critics. Julian Ryall reports. The Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) issued a statement on Saturday, June 10, claiming that none of the five workers at a nuclear research facility that it had previously reported had suffered serious internal radiation exposure after an accident on June 7 have plutonium in their lungs. The agency's report contradicts the initial claim that one of the workers had suffered internal exposure to 22,000 Becquerels of plutonium after a canister that had been in a storage unit at the Oarai Research and Development Center for 26 years was opened and bags holding the material burst. Read: Workers exposed to radioactive material at Japan nuclear research institute The initial JAEA assessment said the worker who had been holding the canister and inhaled some of its contents could expect to have a total of 360,000 Becquerels of radioactivity in his blood, bones and organs, while the other men would have lower rates of exposure. And while the announcement that the men did not inhale plutonium will be more than welcome news to all those affected by the accident, critics say it is just another example of misunderstandings, poor decision-making and lax oversight that continue to plague Japan's nuclear energy industry. Six years after disaster And they say such problems should have been stamped out a long time ago. It's already been six years since Japan endured the second-worst nuclear disaster in history after three reactors at theFukushima Daiichi nuclear plant experienced a meltdown after the facility was hit by an earthquake and tsunami. Japan's Asahi Shimbun newspaper has described the JAEA as \"an organization that has been accused of gross bungling in the past\" and said the confusion over the workers' exposure was caused by high levels of plutonium on the men's skin, not in their lungs. Read: The illusion of normality at Fukushima \"It's just another example of poor management in these organizations,\" said Aileen Mioko Smith, an anti-nuclear campaigner with Kyoto-based Green Action Japan, an NGO. \"I think these organizations have become overly bureaucratic, there is no longer any pride among the workforce in what they are doing - either at these sites or in management - and far too much work is subcontracted out because that is the easiest way for them to save money,\" she told DW. As another example, she points to an accident that occurred in January at the Takahama nuclear power plant, just outside Kyoto, that attracted relatively little media attention. High winds caused a 112-meter crane arm to collapse on the roof of the building that houses spent nuclear fuel rods. People 'furious' \"People living nearby and the local authority were furious,\" Smith said. \"And the explanation that we got from the operator of the plant was that they had not listened to the weather forecast and they did not know that high winds were predicted. That's just stupid.\" The nuclear industry has long had a problem with its patchy reputation for safety - a situation brought into sharp relief in Fukushima, where multiple failures of management have since been identified, including ignoring recommendations that the seawall protecting the plant be built higher and strengthened. The sector's bad image has made it an even less appealing career choice for the Japanese. \"I don't think there are many people there any more who are dedicated to tackling Japan's nuclear energy problems, as there were in the past,\" Smith said. \"The industry has lost its vision and its visionaries of the past and now it has people who really don't care very much. \"And I find that very scary because we now have five reactors online again and they need to be watched very closely, while there are dozens more that now need to be decommissioned,\" she stressed. \"We need capable and experienced people to do that work and make sure there are no more mishaps.\" Accidents unavoidable? Yet Jun Okumura, a political analyst at the Meiji Institute for Global Affairs, says accidents are inevitable in any industry and that the nuclear sector is no different. \"Any organization with this many layers of subcontractors and procedures that require human judgment to be exercised is going to experience problems,\" he said. \"And this is what we have now in this latest incident,\" he added. \"I am sure there will be a government inquiry, the problems will be identified and new regulations will be introduced to make sure the same thing does not happen again.\" The expert agrees that Japan's nuclear energy industry is suffering from an image problem made worse by the events of 2011 and the subsequent revelations. \"The media has obviously been picking up on anything that goes wrong now,\" he said. For Smith, simply accepting that accidents are going to happen in the nuclear industry is unacceptable. Accidents in other heavy industries - shipbuilding, mining, engineering, construction - may happen, but the impact is generally restricted to a small number of people in the immediate vicinity of the incident.

"story": "Post-Brexit fears prey on EU nationals in the UK There are around two million EU citizens living and working in the UK. As Julia Macfarlane discovered, there's a certain sense of panic about their status now that the UK has voted to leave the EU. \"It's very unusual. We rarely get queries from European citizens [about applying for British citizenship] but now we get hundreds a week - email, Facebook, phone calls\u2026We processed 35 new applications last week.\" Immigration lawyers at the Davidson Morris firm have been so inundated with the surge in enquiries from European nationals living in the UK about naturalization that they have hired a new staffer specifically responsible for dealing with the calls. A lot of the initial conversations they have had from people concerned about how the Brexit vote may affect their status in the UK showed that uncertainty over the outcome is causing a lot of anxiety for people who have lived in the UK for many years. In the wake of the vote to leave, Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan told the BBC that no one had suggested a change to the status of EU nationals living in Britain. However, there is a tangible sense of uncertainty for many of those in question. \"Most of the people getting in touch have actually been living and working here for many years,\" says Anisa Ghoshi. \"There was one gentleman who has been here for more than 40 years - since 1973.\" The man is originally Dutch, but told Anisa of the dilemma he was in, identifying completely with the British character and not that of his heritage - despite being a foreigner on paper. \"I'm not a wishy-washy European!\" he said. He has a flawless English accent, Anisa recalled - particularly the very British indignation in that last remark. Recent, subtle amendments to British immigration rules have caught many off guard. Until last November, European nationals living in the UK for five years were automatically granted the status of permanent residency, and after 12 months of continuing this status, were then eligible to apply for citizenship. The Home Office then introduced new rules that meant European Economic Area (EEA) nationals after five years now have to apply formally for permanent residence, proving eligibility in a range of criteria, in order to produce a document that proves their status of residency should they want to pursue citizenship. More bureaucracy An additional layer of bureaucracy, an increase in the time taken to complete the process, and one that caught a lot of European expats off guard - but one that puts an additional stumbling block in front of those wanting to secure their status in the UK, says a leading immigration barrister at Garden Court Chambers in London. \"They've made the application very long and complicated since January this year. There are now more people needing help with applying for permanent residence,\" said Colin Yeo, who also confirmed that there had been a surge in the number of enquiries about citizenship from EEA nationals living in the UK in light of the referendum. The latest Home Office figures show applications for citizenship in 2015 rose by a fifth after the Conservatives won in the general election - standing on a manifesto which promised to hold a referendum before 2017- although the Home Office doesn't break figures down by nationalities from the EU and outside. When asked, the most common concern for EEA nationals enquiring about their status post-Brexit, was the possibility of deportation, or additional bureaucratic hoops to jump through, that if one is not careful and meticulous, could lead to deportation. The vast majority of Europeans enquiring about assistance with permanent residence or naturalizing as British citizens were people who have settled in the UK for many years, even decades, immigration firms told Deutsche Welle. In many cases people had married UK nationals, and had children with dual nationality. Living with uncertainty Despite the uncertainty of what sort of settlement the British government would make with the EU with regard to the status of EU nationals living in the UK, conditions are unlikely to jeopardize their status in the UK. That is, as long as they have been working or living as dependents in the UK for over five years and have an upstanding reputation, although the process of applications may very well be long and arduous, as lawyers are advising their clients. Nearly 40 percent of the total number of European workers in the UK totalling the more than two million people are from countries with far lower average wages such as Poland and Romania. As graduate unemployment continues to grow across the continent, there may be more young, lower-skill jobseekers adding to this number. The fast-food chain Pret a Manger was at the center of a political row several years ago over its high percentage of foreign workers at a time when British unemployment rose to a near 20-year high. It is however newer European migrants, often younger or of lower skilled professions such as retail and hospitality that occupy the lower wage ranges, and who have only recently settled in the UK, who might not have the same confidence of their status should the UK vote to leave the EU. It's of little comfort to Anke, an occupational therapist for the NHS from Germany, who has been here since 1990. She is married to a British citizen with two grown children - both of whom consider themselves British, rather than German. Devastating scenario \"For the first time in 26 years I feel that my future is uncertain and that - depending on the decisions of the government - I could actually lose my right to live in this country. I would find that devastating.\" Given that she has lived and worked in the country for more than a quarter century with strong anchors to the country, she's most likely going to be successful in any application for citizenship - but she will have to go through the process anyway, should the UK vote to leave. \"I think the problem is that nobody truly knows what would happen to the two million EU citizens who live in the UK\u2026I don't feel particularly British but [citizenship] would secure my stay in this country.\"",

"story": "EU to slap fresh sanctions on Belarus Relations between the EU and Belarus have reached a new low point because of continuing repression in the country. German politicians are calling for fresh sanctions, aimed at increasing pressure on the leadership. After the controversial execution of two men in Belarus, the European Union is likely to step up sanctions against the regime of President Alexander Lukashenko. Diplomats believe that at their meeting in Brussels on Friday, the bloc's 27 foreign ministers are set to add more people, nine of them in the judiciary, as well as some 30 companies to its blacklist. Some 200 Belarusians are already targeted with a travel ban and asset freeze over Lukashenko's continuing repression of civil society and the political opposition. Executions have caused criticism The latest EU action was sparked when Belarusian state media reported the execution of Vladislav Kovaljov and Dmitry Konovalov last weekend. The two 26-year-olds were found guilty of a bomb attack in April 2011 in the Minsk underground system, killing 15 people and wounding an additional 300. Civil rights activists and trial observers doubt that the men were guilty. The execution of the two alleged culprits is further straining the already difficult relationships between Brussels and Minsk. Ruprecht Polenz, chairman of the German parliament's foreign affairs aommittee, strongly condemns the execution. \u201cBelarus is the only country in Europe that still applies the death penalty,\" he said. \"The verdict in this case was based on an arbitrary trial with considerable flaws, which went completely against the rule of law.\u201c Markus L\u00f6ning, the German government's human rights commissioner, stresses that the trial did not meet international standards. There is a good chance, he says, that the two men were not behind the attacks. During the trial, one of them said that he had made the confession under torture. \u201cPresident Lukashenko has himself to blame if the relationships between Belarus and European countries are at a very low point,\" L\u00f6ning told DW. \"Of course they are low when he is committing crimes against humanity and against human rights in such an obvious way.\u201c Sanctions targetting the regime, not the population The relationship between Brussels and Minsk turned colder in late February. In a move to hit back at the EU for its latest round of sanctions, Minsk withdrew its EU and Poland ambassadors and brought them back \u201cfor consultations.\u201d In response, the EU withdrew all its diplomats from Belarus. At Friday's meeting in Brussels, foreign ministers are set to discuss if and when the ambassadors will return to Minsk. The EU has been trying for years to step up pressure on the regime in Minsk through sanctions. Sanctions are the most effective way of telling Lukashenko that his politics are not acceptable in Europe, says Polenz. But it's just as important that sanctions do not increase the population's suffering. After all, the people are already suffering the most under Lukashenko. \u201cIt's not the Belarusian people who are responsible for what Lukashenko is doing to them,\u201c says Polenz. On the contrary, the idea is to open doors for Belarusians and to ease visa regulations. \u201cWe want to give young Belarusians the possibility to study in Europe and get an education here.\u201c L\u00f6ning agrees that the EU sanctions should only be targetted at those responsible for the repressions in Belarus. According to L\u00f6ning, the message to the people is \u201cwe are by your side, we stand ready to help you, to free you from this dictator.\" \"We are still calling on the president to give his people the rights they deserve: they need to be a free people and live lives like those in their neighboring countries,\u201d says the German human rights representative. Minsk: a burden for Moscow Of course, the Europeans only have a limited influence \u2013 Minsk simply has to make the right decisions itself, Polenz believes. Belarus depends heavily on Russia's gas and oil exports, and the EU's sanctions threaten to push Belarus even further towards Moscow. \u201cThat's not the goal of the sanctions,\u201c Polenz stresses, adding that the EU always sends out two messages: \u201cFirst, we want the country to be governed in a different way, and secondly, we invite it to cooperate with Europe and to develop in a way that brings it closer to Europe.\u201c Minsk is increasingly becoming a burden for Moscow, says Polenz \u2013 economically, politically, and morally. One example: Belarus pays only a third of the gas price Russia gets from countries like the Ukraine. Russian media also criticized the execution of the two suspected bombers. \u201cThat's why we're hoping that Russia \u2013 for all its interest in strengthening the bond with Belarus \u2013 thinks about what kind of a Belarus it wants to work with,\" says Polenz. \"Russia also has to find an answer to the question of whether it's acceptable to be a direct ally and friend of a country regardless of the state it's in and of how it's being governed.\u201d Author: Markian Ostaptschuk / nh Editor: Ben Knight",

"story": "Opinion: Obama defends Libya intervention In his speech to America, President Obama successfully justified the intervention in Libya and fended off domestic criticism. He made clear that the coalition acted to stop a massacre, argues DW's Christina Bergmann. In a resolute address to the American people nine days after ordering airstrikes against Libya, President Barack Obama successfully defended the UN-sanctioned military action from domestic critics. Obama had come under fire in recent days for not clearly defining the goals of the air campaign. The American people did not fully understand why their soldiers should risk their lives in this distant land. After all, Washington does not have obvious strategic interests in Libya. And many conservative politicians criticized the White House for so readily turning over leadership of the operation to other nations. The US president answered these questions in his speech and simultaneously defined his administration's policy toward military intervention. When a massacre looms or the stability of an entire region is in danger, then the US will intervene. Both Washington and the world have a responsibility to act in these situations, according to Obama. He reminded viewers - and rightly so - that in Bosnia during the 1990s the international community had looked on for much too long as horrific crimes were committed. Lessons of Iraq Obama also made clear that Washington had learned its lessons from the Iraq War. He explained that the military goal in Libya was not the overthrow of Moammar Gadhafi. The US simply cannot afford to invest the resources in regime change, he said. And Obama also demonstrated that the US would not act alone. The UN should be happy that Washington has shown strong leadership and has not completely withdrawn from international politics after a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Without the US, the international community would be a paper tiger. In order to enforce Security Council resolutions, establish no-fly zones and protect civilians, the world's military superpower has to play a constructive role. There's simply no way around this reality. However, Obama also clearly stated that American engagement in Libya is limited. There will be no ground troops and NATO will take over the reigns of the operation on Wednesday. On the one hand, the handover is a political calculation in order to reassure skeptical Americans about the intervention. On the other hand, it is simply necessary. The US is not in the financial and military position to wage a third war on its own over the long-term. President Obama presented himself as a head of state who is indeed ready to deploy soldiers and resources elsewhere in the world to rescue human lives. Yet he also made clear that he carefully weighs the pros and cons and acts pragmatically. In other words, intervention in Libya does not mean that the demonstrators in Syria, Yemen, Bahrain or Iran can expect to receive massive support from the US. Above all else, President Obama is looking after his own country's interests. Author: Christina Bergmann/ sk Editor: Rob Mudge",

"story": "Vaccination timetable unclear as swine flu spreads Failing to reach agreement over funding the German government's plan to launch mass vaccinations remains riddled with uncertainties. Experts point to the new drugs' unknown side effects as another problem. The number of swine flu cases in Germany has risen by several hundred since the beginning of the week and now stands at close to 15,000 the Robert-Koch Institute reported on Wednesday. The institution officially in charge of recording the outbreak in Germany added that most new infections were caught by people travelling abroad. Faced with the growing extent of the swine flu outbreak in Germany, the federal government last week decided to launch the largest mass immunization program in the nation's history. Vaccinations are expected to start in October when sufficient serum is available, a Health Ministry spokeswoman said. Federal and state governments are aiming at obtaining a total of 50 million doses from drug company GlaxoSmithKline. Since every person has to be vaccinated twice, this would be sufficient for 25 million people. Delays due to unclear funding But, state health ministers, who have failed to reach agreement on how to pay for it, have not yet been able to place necessary additional orders, as planned. Public health funds will foot half the bill estimated at about one billion euros ($1.45 billion), but states and the federal government have not decided on how to split the remainder between them. As a result, vaccinations for all but the most vulnerable groups, such as children and pensioners, will only start in late fall. Health ministers are planning to hold a special meeting in Berlin in two weeks before placing the additional orders stalled so far. Side effects feared Experts are concerned about yet another problem due to the massive extent of the operation and the short time available for drug companies to develop and test substances against swine flu. \"We may have to reckon with a larger number of previously unknown side effects\", warned the Germany Association of Pediatricians (BKJV). A federal medical institute also pointed out that side effects like headaches or swellings may be more likely with vaccines against swine flu compared to those against seasonal flu viruses. The Health Ministry does not deny this and Minister Ulla Schmidt last week said she would not recommend vaccinating children until all medical studies have been completed. Another risk lies in the different methods of developing substances in Europe and the US, Wolfgang Becker-Br\u00fcser told the German newspaper \"Muenchner Merkur\". The Munich-based medical journal editor said that US labs use common flu vaccines and adapt them to deal with the new virus. \"This method is safer compared to what the Europeans and Germany are doing\", he added.

"story": "Death toll from Syrian bus bombing rises to 126; includes 68 children The death toll in a bombing of a bus convoy carrying evacuees from Syrian government-held territory has risen, said a monitor. The transfers are part of a massive relocation of people along political and sectarian lines. The death toll from Saturday's bus bombing in Syria has risen to 126, and includes 68 children. The attack struck a bus convoy carrying residents from the northern towns of Fuaa and Kafraya as they waited at a transit point in rebel-held Rashidin, west of Aleppo. At least 109 of the dead were evacuees, according to the British-based monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The evacuations are part of a broader relocation agreement between the Syrian regime and rebel forces involving thousands of people. The large numbers and ethnic make-up of those being relocated appears to represent a new phase of the six-year old civil war that has claimed nearly 350,000 lives. Critics of the latest relocations say the string of evacuations, which could see some 30,000 people moved across battle lines over the next two months, amounts to forced displacement along political and sectarian lines. On Sunday, a day after the gruesome bus attack, body parts and the belongings of evacuees - including clothes, dishes and even televisions - remained strewn about the scene of the attack. The shattered buses were nearby, as was the shell of a pick-up truck that was apparently used to carry out the bombing. No claim of responsibility No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack and the key Ahrar al-Sham rebel group denied any involvement. The government blamed \"terrorists\" - a term it uses generally to refer to all of its opponents. The Observatory, which relies on a network of sources inside Syria to monitor the conflict, said hundreds more people were wounded in the blast. It said a petrol station at the transit point was consumed in the explosion, adding to the number of victims. The Syrian Red Crescent said three of its workers were among the wounded. Maysa al-Aswad, a 30-year-old evacuee from Kafraya, told news agency AFP that she was sitting on one bus with her six-month-old son Hadi and 10-year-old daughter Narjis when the blast shook the parked convoy. \"Hadi was on my lap and Narjis on a chair next to me. When the explosion happened I hugged them both and we fell to the floor,\" she said. \"I didn't know what was happening, all I could hear was people crying and shouting.\" She added, \"All I can think about is how we survived all the death during the last few years and then could have died just after we finally escaped.\" bik/rs (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)",

"story": "RFID Chips: the Future of Security? Radio Frequency Identification may very well be the basis of security and ID systems in the years to come, according to the technology's pioneers. Despite some problems, RFID looks set to become part of all our lives. Wandering the cavernous halls of the CeBIT trade fair, one may walk past the future of computerized security and identification and not know it. Indeed, walking past the stand featuring the SAP/Intel RFID chip is about as close to the cutting edge as it gets. The German software giant SAP and the American chip manufacturer Intel announced a new strategic alliance at the IT trade fair in Hanover this week. They hope that the RFID -- radio-frequency identification -- technology will take the security sector by storm by offering applications for everything from cattle tagging to event ticket sales. \"With RFID, you can monitor the whereabouts of products in a warehouse or the price and transmit that product information,\" technology expert J\u00fcrgen Kuri told Deutsche Welle. According to the manufacturers, monitoring stock would be one of the most basic applications but one of its most commercially successful. The implications for large chain stores would be immense. The US giant Wal-Mart already uses the technology in its warehouse. Stock application aids efficiency RFID technology makes scanning large amounts of stock and sorting and distributing products simpler and faster. The chip transmits information needed to efficiently locate, pack and send wares on their way quickly and easily. However, the RFID chips can do more than just help in the logging of products. \"The chips can be used, for example, in electronic identity cards, biometric systems, even in tickets for the World Cup,\" J\u00fcrgen Kuri added. \"However, if one buys a ticket or product with a chip installed, it would have to be destroyed afterwards to avoid any further information being released.\" It is a sensitive issue that SAP and Intel are trying to address. \"For this reason we have begun an initiative with a number of organizations to secure the RFID from hackers and to protect data security and the private sphere,\" SAP's Christoph Lessm\u00f6llmann said Chip security open to hackers However, there remains at this time no concrete protection against hackers. It appears that vigilance, at the moment, is the best defense. \"Wherever there is data stored, there is a risk of illegal practice,\" J\u00fcrgen Kuri commented. \"Therefore, the simplest principle of modern data security is avoiding people getting to the data.\" Despite the work-in-progress nature of the security measures of the chips themselves, the business implications for the technology are as potentially huge as the number of applications. IDTechEX, a management consultancy from Cambridge, Massachusetts, estimates that the global RFID market by 2008 will exceed $7 billion. At the moment, the chips are still relatively expensive but SAP is working together with Intel to remedy this as fast as possible. \"We hope that the massive demand for the chips will eventually help us cut the production costs,\" Lessm\u00f6llmann said.",

"story": "Tunisian FM: 'We are not yet a democracy' Is Tunisia, the only democracy to emerge from the Arab Spring, slipping back into repression and chaos? Tim Sebastian meets Foreign Minister Khemaies Jhinaoui. Since ousting its authoritarian President Zine al Abidine Ben Ali in 2011, Tunisia has struggled in its transition to a democracy. The Arab Spring began in the North African country and Tunisians have indeed enjoyed unprecedented political rights and civil liberties since the transition to democracy began. But authorities have struggled to control corruption, high unemployment and have faced new security threats. The country has seen nine governments since the revolution. None have been able to completely address these issues. In January 2018, a Freedom House report stated that Tunisia has come \"dangerously close to losing its status as the only 'free' country to emerge from the Arab Spring.\" Two high-profile Islamist attacks in the country 2015 targeted the country's all-important tourism sector. The number of European tourists to Tunisia rapidly declined as did foreign investment. The country's public debt has risen 40 billion dinars (around 13.4 billion euros). Tunisia has struggled to contain an Islamist insurgency while reforming its security forces to respect human rights and build the economy. Tunisia's Foreign Minister Khemaies Jhinaoui admitted that his country still has a long way to go in a DW interview: \"To be honest, we are not yet a democracy. (\u2026) We are on the path of reaching a democratic system where transparency and the rule of law will be respected [100 percent].\" Annual human rights protests In January 2018, on the seventh anniversary of the Arab Spring, thousands of Tunisians protested against austerity measures \u2013 the government had passed the 2018 Finance Act which increases taxes and raises fuel prices to solve the inflation. Seven years after the uprisings for \"work, freedom and dignity\" many young Tunisians feel that, beyond freedom of expression, they have gained little from the revolution. This is one of the reasons why the number of Tunisians trying to cross the Mediterranean by boat was higher in 2017 than at any time since the Arab Spring in 2011. A campaigner for one of the protesting organizations, Hamza Obeidi, told DW News in January 2018: \"The Tunisian economic system has not improved after the revolution because it is still based on the policies adopted since independence.\" He said the country is still battling with the corruption of the Ben Ali regime, which ruled the country more than two decades. Obeidi said the current government's \"war on corruption is merely media marketing.\" Arrested for distributing leaflets But Tunisia doesn't just have a problem with the economy. Several human rights organizations heavily criticized the government\u2019s handling of the protests. Human Rights Watch accused the Tunisian police of beating up some of the people detained and denying their right to a lawyer. Some people were allegedly only arrested for distributing leaflets calling for social justice. Foreign Minister Jhinaoui, who called protest \"a healthy sign\" in a democracy, responded to the allegations: \"Is mistreatment a policy, a deliberate policy in Tunisia today? I can tell you, no.\" \"More than 700 people [were arrested], most of all of them they have been freed. Those who were involved in looting, vandalism, they went to the court and they have been persecuted according to the law. Tunisia today is a country which respects the role the rule of law.\" Security forces showed 'professionalism' He defended Tunisian police officers: \"Our forces handled these protests with a lot of professionalism. There were no single casualties. These, there were rioters, there were (...) but no single casualties.\" Prime Minister Youssef Chahed vowed to end the critical period after the demonstrations: \"People have to understand that the situation is extraordinary and their country has difficulties but we believe that 2018 will the last difficult year for Tunisians.\" In the years following the Arab Spring, extremists have started radicalizing and recruiting young people. The immediate danger of this development can be seen in the terror attacks in 2015 on the Bardo Museum and a beach front hotel in Sousse as well as an attack on the presidential guard in November 2015. Asked about how the country is coping with the terrorist threat, Foreign Minister Jhinaoui said: \"Today, I think that our forces are better trained, well-equipped.\" Terrorism in Tunisia He said a US State Department report stating that terrorist groups continue to operate in the mountains of western Tunisia was \u201dtoo exaggerated\u201d and said there is \"no territory in Tunisia held by terrorists.\" \"We are not like other Middle-Eastern countries where terrorists were able to hold the peripheries. Tunisia is completely under control of the state. (\u2026) The last two years, Tunisia was immune [to] any terrorist threat.\" But more people have volunteered to join the so-called 'Islamic State' from Tunisia than from any other country. Now that 'IS' has collapsed in Syria and been removed from Iraq, several thousand Tunisians who had joined its ranks are believed to have returned home. When DW's Tim Sebastian confronted him with these numbers, Jhinaoui called them \"exaggerated.\" According to the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights, Tunisia has no proper de-radicalization program in place for foreign fighters with many allegedly only being placed under house arrest after returning. The foreign minister said: \"There is a comprehensive policy trying to de-radicalize all these young people. (\u2026) If they come [to] any democratic country which is respecting the rule of law, these people, when they come back, of course they are held, interrogated by the police and, if found guilty, they go to the court and of course they will be prosecuted accordingly.\"",

Four activists were awarded the 2009 Right Livelihood award in the Stockholm parliament on Friday for \"offering practical and exemplary answers to the most urgent challenges facing us today.\" The so-called \"Alternative Nobels\" have been awarded since 1980. David Suzuki of Canada won an honorary award for \"his lifetime advocacy of the socially responsible use of science,\" as well as his contributions to highlighting the issue of climate change. He expressed concerns before the awards ceremony that the imminent Copenhagen conference would result in a contract emphasizing economics over the environment. \"The worst possible thing would be a half-hearted agreement,\" he told the dpa news agency, saying it was better to work for a better deal next year. \"We have partied as if there is no tomorrow, using things up and throwing them away without regard to the future,\" Suzuki said on Thursday. \"Well, the party's over and we have to sober up, clean up our mess, assess our situation and get on with acting for a future.\" He also admitted doubting the Canadian government's commitment to dealing with climate change, saying that Ottawa \"would try to prevent any hard targets and time frames and enforcement mechanisms.\" Prize winning activism Other laureates honored were Rene Ngongo, of the Democratic Republic of Congo, who won for his courage in establishing conservation efforts for the rainforests of the Congo. \"Climate change is the biggest threat our planet has to face right now,\" Ngongo said. \"The world must act now - if not, we risk suffering from growing and irreversible disturbances that will exceed our capacities to adapt.\" New Zealand's Alyn Ware won for his work promoting peace education and campaigns against nuclear weapons. In Ethiopia, Australian-born Catherine Hamlin, was awarded the prize for her 50 years of work dedicated to treating obstetric fistula patients.

"story": "'Land is becoming a scarce commodity' The UN Committee on World Food Security on Friday adopted draft guidelines against land grabbing to better protect rural communities. DW spoke to the UN's Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, Olivier De Schutter. The UN's new guidelines against land grabbing came after an outcry by developing countries over the large farmland that is being bought by rich nations. DW: Mr de Shutter, in summary, what does the draft against land grabbing state? Olivier De Schutter: The draft guidelines on the responsible governance of tenures of land, fisheries and forests are guidelines that seek to clarify what states should do in order to protect land users. Essentially, in many countries land users are not legally recognized as the owners of the land. This is particularly the case in Africa - in rural parts of Africa - where land is considered to be owned by the state. And the state very often gives away this land to investors who offer to develop this land, and land users who depend on this land for their livelihoods are evicted without having access to legal remedies and without being protected from the loss of their livelihoods. And so these guidelines seek to clarify what states should do, how they should consult, which compensation they should provide in order to reduce the impacts of land grabbing on these rural communities in Africa. How has the land grabbing of large farmland in developing countries, especially African countries, violated human rights? These are very poor populations which are not very influential politically. And they have been unable as yet to mobilize and to effectively challenge this phenomenon that is called land grabbing and that is essentially the result of the growing worldwide demand for natural resources. Since 2008, and 2009 in particular, both the private sector - private companies - and governments are interested in buying and leasing large areas of land and having access to water underneath the land, because land is becoming a scarce commodity. And we are entering into a phase of repeated crisis where prices of food commodities in particular will be more and more volatile. These actors seek to protect their access to national resources by buying land which in many cases rural communities depend on. And human rights such as the right to food, right to housing, even the right to life sometimes are threatened by this phenomenon. Which African countries are most affected by land grabbing? Two thirds of land grabbing is taking place in sub-Saharan Africa. In weakly governed zones where governments are not effectively protecting the populations and where courts are not able to protect communities who depend on access to natural resources. Many of these lands are given away by governments, often unfortunately as a result of corruption and because the local elites benefit from these transactions but not the rural communities who remain underprotected. To what extent does land grabbing contribute to food security or insecurity? The land grabbing results in large-scale plantations being developed that are highly mechanized and that are relatively less-labor-intensive than the small-scale family farming that's usually practiced by rural communities in developing countries. The result of this is that, in general, less employment will be created. A large number of people may lose their livelihoods and their access to the land on which they depend for their food. And for those who do not find employment on these large-scale plantations, it will mean that they will be without revenues and without adequate livelihoods. The result is that these people will migrate to the cities in the hope of finding employment in the industry and service sectors, but in many cases, those jobs are not be easy to find. And so the result is social disruption, more poverty and inequality in the rural areas and that is what we want to avoid. How does the UN plan to ensure that human rights standards are maintained where huge lands are bought by foreigners? The work of the Committee on World Food Security today is meant to designate a set of principles that states should respect in order to better protect the land users. These principles should be implemented in domestic legislation. They should be a source of reference for courts and national human rights institutions, and states should be gradually led to report back on how they implement these guidelines. This will be supervised at international level by the Committee on World Food Security that will regularly collect information as to how these guidelines are being complied with at a domestic level. It is not enough. It is something however - it is a departure point and it is certainly important in this current context to provide some international framework to define what states are expected to do.

"story": "Spielberg's 'The Post': How 1970s politics resonate with today's era of 'fake news'  Even though its narrative deals with the Pentagon Papers, which revealed secret details of US actions during the Vietnam War, the 1970s scandal serves as an allegory of the current political climate. When the Pentagon Papers were leaked in the summer of 1971, the information they contained shook American society. The papers were historical records of the Vietnam War which had been prepared under Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara since 1967; The New York Times and The Washington Post published parts of these top-secret documents, thereby revealing the full extent of military and political involvement of the US army and government in Vietnam from 1945 to 1967. They demonstrated, for instance, how the US secretly performed coastal raids in Northern Vietnam and extensive bombings of nearby Cambodia and Laos. Another distorted event was the so-called Gulf of Tonkin incident from 1964. The US government had claimed at first that North Vietnamese torpedo boats had fired on a US ship, and that the whole American nation was under an imminent communist threat. In the wake of the event, the US increased the number of soldiers in the area. But the Pentagon Papers revealed that it was actually the American ship, the USS Maddox, which had shot first. All of this had been kept secret from the public, which received a very different image of the conflict through the media. Read more: Washington Post 'Watergate' editor Ben Bradlee dies, aged 93 From Nixon to Trump Steven Spielberg's latest movie \"The Post,\" which stars Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep, dramatizes the events leading to the publication of the documents, and their aftermath. The plot revolves around the timeless themes of freedom of the press and the judiciary system; it is easy to see a parallel between the 1970s scandal and the current events surrounding US President Donald Trump. After all, Spielberg himself said in numerous interviews that \"The allegory is obvious.\" He pointed more directly to the parallels between then and now in an interview with the Austrian magazine Kurier, saying, \"Nixon did not stick to the truth as much as it deserved it. Doesn't it remind you of someone?\" Read more: Spielberg's 'The Post': a cautionary tale of press freedom Spielberg: 'It's a patriotic film' According to the director's own words, \"The Post\" is a \"patriotic film.\" He noted, however, that he did not shoot the movie due to his affiliation with the Democratic party, but simply because he believes in journalism. \"It is an antidote to 'fake news.' Those journalists in the movie are true heroes,\" he added. Richard Nixon's government had tried to prevent the publication of the Papers and even appealed for support to a federal court, where he initially succeeded: After three reports, the New York Times was forced to cease further publication of the remaining stories. But just a few days later, the Washington Post resumed with its own series of excerpts. The Papers were eventually released when a proponent of the publication, US Senator Mike Gravel, entered the documents into an unrelated subcommittee of his. The US Supreme Court then ruled that public interest and freedom of the press has more weight than the secrecy of state interests. All this is strikingly reminiscent of the current political situation, in particular the inquiry surrounding Trump's administration's ties to Russia. Read more: Donald Trump allies say special counsel 'unlawfully' obtained thousands of emails Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep co-star for the first time Starring Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks in the lead roles of a newspaper editor and a journalist, \"The Post\" has already received a lot of attention even before its premiere. The film has been already honored at the National Board of Review Gala when it received the prizes for best film. Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks both won in their respective categories too. At the Golden Globes, the latest Spielberg's opus, however, left the ceremony empty-handed. Its chances for an Oscar are not bad; as special counsel Robert Mueller plans to interview President Trump in his Russian inquiry, parallels with the events depicted in \"The Post\" are still developing. \"The Post\" hits US cinemas on January 12 and will premiere in most European countries throughout January and February",

"story": "Nowitzki and Dallas swept aside in NBA playoffs German basketball legend Dirk Nowitzki has failed to lead his Dallas Mavericks to back-to-back NBA titles in the US. The defending champs were utterly floored at the first hurdle against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The NBA champion Dallas Mavericks were swept out of the NBA playoffs in the first round over the weekend, losing their seven-game series against the Oklahoma City Thunder 4-0. Playing with home-court advantage in their last-chance-saloon fourth game late on Saturday, the Mavericks led by 13 points early in the fourth and final quarter - but could not hold the advantage and lost 103-97. Nowitzki, Dallas' most influential player for years and the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award winner of last season's finals against the Miami Heat, led his team even in defeat, notching up 34 points. Another veteran superstar on the Dallas roster, point guard Jason Kidd, bagged 16 points, eight assists and seven rebounds in an impressive all-round performance. The 33-year-old German, for whom time is starting to run short where silverware is concerned, lauded the young Oklahoma victors. The Thunder had racked up a far superior record to Dallas in the regular season, which is used as a basis to decide how US basketball's top sides will be seeded in the all-important playoffs. \"I just thought they had more weapons than us,\" Nowitzki said after the game. The Mavericks - led by Nowitzki, 18-year veteran Kidd, and 34-year-old livewire Jason Terry - are the oldest team in all the NBA. The new order rises Rising star Kevin Durant led the Thunder throughout the four-game series, also scoring 24 points and 11 rebounds in Saturday's encounter. But another of the young Oklahoma stars, James Harden, did the real game 4 damage, going on a late scoring tear to eradicate Dallas' advantage. Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle praised the team that vanquished his side, hinting that the Thunder might be the surprise package of the entire playoff campaign - not just of the first round. \"They're a great young team,\" Carlisle said. \"And the thing that impressed me most about them is that they have a certain look in their eye right now; not just that they belong, but that this could be their time.\" The result was sweet revenge for the Oklahoma troupe, who lost out to the Mavericks last year as Nowitzki and co. swept towards their first ever championship. Nowitzki is the most successful German basketball player of all time by a wide margin. In 2006, he became the first ever European to win the coveted Most Valuable Player award for regular season performance; he's still the continent's only NBA MVP. He is also the highest scoring player in Mavericks history, by a whopping 4,000-point margin, and he's the 19th-most prolific basketball player in NBA history - with a realistic chance of climbing several more places before he bows out of the game. In his 2006 MVP season, \"the Mavs\" went into the playoffs as the top seeded team in all of basketball, only to crash out in the first round to the Golden State Warriors. For all his success, veteran Nowitzki is no stranger to this weekend's sadness either. msh/sej (AFP, AP, dpa)",

"story": "War crimes spokeswoman on trial over Milosevic secrets A former spokeswoman for the tribunal set up to deal with Yugoslav war crimes was has gone on trial there herself. She is charged with contempt of court over the publication of classified information. Florence Hartmann, who was spokeswoman for the former chief war crimes prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, between 2000 and 2006, is accused of having disclosed confidential information about the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in a book and an article published after she left her post. The publications allegedly cite confidential documents and court decisions made during the trial of former Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, which implicate the Serbian state in the 1995 massacre of thousands of men and boys in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica. In his opening speech, ICTY prosecutor Bruce MacFarlane said he would show that the accused had consciously published information from classified documents. But Hartmann's lawyer, Guenael Mettraux, says she did no wrong as the information referred to in her article and her book, entitled \u201cPeace and Punishment: The Secret Wars of Politics and International Justice\u201d was already in the public domain when her work went into print. Online support The journalist's supporters, many journalists themselves, are running an internet petition which calls for the case to be dropped. They say Hartmann was merely doing her job \u201cby rigorously searching for and publicizing the truth.\u201d The petition goes on to say that making Hartmann appear before a court established to try those guilty of genocide \u201cwill tarnish the image of the international justice system.\u201d Hartmann, who could face seven years in prison or a fine of \u20ac100,000 ($139,000) if found guilty, declined to enter a plea on either charge. The court entered two pleas of \u201cnot guilty\u201d on her behalf. The trial is expected to continue until Wednesday. tkw/AFP/AP/dpa Editor: Jennifer Abramsohn",

"story": "India to push US to extradite former Union Carbide chief A ministerial panel has presented several recommendations to the government after a court sentenced former Union Carbide employees to only two years in jail earlier this month, prompting widespread public outrage. Ever since a lenient verdict on the 1984 Bhopal disaster earlier this month, the Indian government has faced mounting criticism. Victims and activists called the Bhopal ruling a travesty of justice because of the paltry sentences, the long delay in bringing justice and the inadequate clean-up of the disaster site. On Monday, a group of survivors from the Bhopal gas tragedy staged a demonstration in front of India's Home Ministry in New Delhi demanding adequate compensation for the victims. So as to mitigate people's anger, which has been exacerbated by the fact that the current ruling party was already in power when the world's worst industrial disaster happened, the government had formed a panel of senior ministers to draw up recommendations for fresh action. Panel urges government to make great efforts In its report, presented on Monday, the panel recommends that the government make strong efforts to seek the extradition of the ex-Union Carbide chief Warren Anderson, who has been classified as an absconder. \"India will make vigorous efforts\" to have Anderson extradited, the Indian Minister for Urban Development, Jaipal Reddy, told the AFP news agency. Anderson, who is now retired, was arrested after the gas leak but he then fled the country. Opposition parties accused the ruling party of letting Anderson escape Bhopal on a government plane. Repeated requests by the Indians for his extradition turned out to be in vain. Enhanced compensation for victims and relatives The ministerial panel has also finalized a package worth rupees 1,500 crore, or nearly 325 million US dollars, for enhancing compensation for the relatives of those who died and those who were debilitated by the disaster. The gas leak at the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal claimed an estimated 15,000 lives. Many thousands were permanently disabled or are still suffering from critical ailments. According to Reddy, as cited by AFP, the government has recommended the setting up of a federal medical research facility in Bhopal to monitor the health conditions of survivors and newborns. The ministers have also recommended that the government help clean up the site and bury toxic material.

"story": "AirAsia search team finds four 'large objects' The Indonesia Search and Rescue Agency searching for AirAsia flight 8501 has found two more \"large parts\" of the crashed jet, bringing the total to four pieces of debris. The plane had been carrying 162 people. Agency chief Fransiskus Bambang Soelistyo said on Saturday that the four large objects were found in the Java Sea using an Indonesian ship equipped with sonar technology. Despite high waves on Saturday, search teams extended their hunt for bodies and wreckage. So far, some 30 bodies have been found. Two other objects were also found earlier on Saturday, some 30 meters (90 feet) below the surface. No survivors have been found. \"We managed to detect two large objects - one three-dimensioned, another two-dimensioned,\" Soelistyo said, adding there were signs of an oil spill. \"I can confirm that they are parts of the plane we are looking for,\" he said. The Airbus A320-200 disappeared during a flight from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore, after losing contact with air traffic control on December 28. Prior to losing contact, the pilot requested to ascend to avoid approaching threatening clouds. Permission was denied, however, due to heavy air traffic. On Saturday, Indonesian authorities also grounded all AirAsia flights from Surabaya to Singapore, saying that the airline had not had a permit to fly on Sundays - the same day that the AirAsia 8501 flight went down over the Java Sea. ksb/se (Reuters, AFP, dpa)",

"story": "Is Afghanistan's friendship with India imperiling security? After a spate of recent deadly bombings, the Afghan capital Kabul still remains in shock. Experts believe Afghanistan's increasingly close ties with India are a reason for the uptick in violence. \"As soon as you step into the city you can sense that there is only fear and horror,\" says Sirajuddin Yuldash, a resident of Kabul. \"People are even scared of police cars and try to hide from them as soon as they see them to avoid the next suicide bombing, which can happen anytime.\" Violence has never been absent in the Afghan capital, and the recent incidents are just another episode of suicide attacks and bombings that have rocked the city. Still, the increasing brutality and high number of casualties have left many Afghans shaken. On September 5, twin blasts carried out by the Taliban insurgent group followed by a 11-hour standoff with Afghan security forces killed at least 41 people, including senior government officials, and left over 100 people wounded. And a couple of weeks ago, 16 people lost their lives when militants stormed the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul. The insurgents, however, are targeting not just the capital, but also provinces such as Uruzgan and Helmand. Reports suggest that the capital of Uruzgan, Tarin Kowt, is on the verge of falling to the Taliban, as militants have fought their way to within a few kilometers of the city over the past several days. Ever since the Taliban was toppled from power in 2001 by US-led NATO forces, the militant group has been engaged in an armed struggle to dislodge the Western-backed government in Kabul. But some observers believe Afghanistan's increasingly close ties with India are a reason for the recent uptick in violence. India increases military aid New Delhi has had close ties to Kabul since the fall of the Taliban regime, and emerged as one of Afghanistan's major donors, underwriting an array of development projects in the impoverished nation. Furthermore, military cooperation between the two sides has been on the rise, with India recently gifting four Mi-25 attack helicopters to bolster the Afghan Air Force's ability to help ground troops fighting Taliban militants. India also trains hundreds of Afghan soldiers each year in its military academy. In its first public response to Indian military aid, the Taliban recently urged New Delhi to stop giving defense equipment to the Afghan government, condemning it as a \"clear hostility\" towards the war-ravaged nation. \"We call on India to stop exporting items of killing and destruction to Afghanistan and to stop efforts of prolonging the lifespan of this corrupt regime with its military aid,\" Zabihullah Mujahid, the spokesperson for the Taliban, said in a statement released on Sunday, September 4. \"Taking recent Taliban statements into account, it becomes obvious that the Jihadists are identifying India not only as a partner of US interests in Afghanistan but also as an increasing successor in military terms and subsequently as a primary target,\" says Siegfried O. Wolf, a South Asia analyst at the University of Heidelberg. \"As such, the last Taliban attacks in Kabul are not only directed against the Afghan government but are also a signal towards New Delhi to stay out of the country, that India - like the US - is identified as hostile foreign influence,\" he told DW. New Delhi replaces Washington? The deepening of the bilateral military cooperation comes at a time when the US is looking to gradually back away from Afghanistan. Many say the US has already named New Delhi its \"successor\" to take over Washington's role in Afghanistan, citing US Secretary of State John Kerry's recent announcement on an Afghanistan-India-US trilateral dialogue in New York next month. The announcement has been met with dismay in Pakistan, which has so far been the go-to partner on Afghan security issues. Islamabad's military-intelligence establishment has traditionally maintained close ties with the Taliban, and Afghan officials have accused Pakistan of providing safe harbor to the militant group's leadership on its territory. Haroon Mir, a political analyst at the think tank Afghanistan Center for Research Policy Studies, is convinced that the trilateral talks and the exclusion of Pakistan have definitely had an impact on Islamabad's actions towards Kabul. \"These attacks are a threat to Afghanistan's government. Pakistan has warned Kabul before that they are able to have an impact on the situation in Afghanistan and they have now proved it by using the Taliban.\" Choosing between Pakistan and India Both New Delhi and Islamabad have wrestled for influence in Kabul in recent decades. But the strengthening of ties between New Delhi and Kabul has sparked fears of a possible proxy war in Afghanistan between India and Pakistan, a historic backer of the Taliban. \"Closer ties between Kabul and New Delhi are not only an outcome of decades-long friendship between the two countries but also a logical consequence of Pakistan's approach towards Afghanistan,\" underlined Wolf. \"Pakistan's double game of officially supporting the international 'war on terror' and covered state-sponsorship for Jihadists is an obvious contradiction to Islamabad's public rhetoric of being interested in a stable, peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan.\" Nevertheless, Afghanistan is economically dependent on Pakistan. Experts say both countries have to cooperate regionally and work towards a normalization of their bilateral relations. If the two countries fail to improve their relations, they will face not only economic disaster but also armed conflict, Wolf said. Against this backdrop, Afghans are increasingly concerned about the severe impact the geopolitical struggle involving Afghanistan, Pakistan and India is having on their lives and security.

"story": "US, Vietnam cooperate to clean up toxic Agent Orange The US sprayed millions of liters of Agent Orange on the jungles of Vietnam during its war there, creating long-term adverse health effects. Decades later, the former enemies are cooperating to clean up the chemical. The United States began helping Vietnam clean up the toxic chemical defoliant Agent Orange for the first time on Thursday, nearly 40 years after the end of Washington's bloody war with the Southeast Asian communist nation. The US and Vietnam plan to decontaminate some 73,000 cubic meters (2.5 million cubic feet) of soil surrounding the Da Nang airport in the central part of the country. American forces stored and loaded Agent Orange onto planes at Da Nang during the war, which ended in 1975. Between 1,000,000 and 2,500,000 Vietnamese died in the war and over 58,000 Americans. \"We are both moving earth and taking the first steps to bury the legacies of our past,\" US Ambassador to Vietnam David Shear said at a ceremony at Da Nang airport on Thursday. \"I look forward to even more successes to follow.\" Washington sprayed some 45 million liters (12 million gallons) of the defoliant during the Vietnam War in \"Operation Ranch Hand,\" a campaign to remove the jungle canopy and expose North Vietnamese forces and their supply lines to attack. Agent Orange contains the chemical dioxin, which is known to cause cancer and respiratory problems. The Vietnamese government claims that up to four million of its citizens suffer from diseases related to Agent Orange. US soldiers were also affected by the chemical. Washington, for its part, maintains that the link between dioxin exposure and disease is \"uncertain.\" The two former enemies are using technology that heats the contaminated soil at Da Nang to high temperatures, thereby breaking down the dioxin and rendering it into harmless compounds. According to the US embassy, the soil around Da Nang should be safe again by 2016. No compensation for victims Although the US has begun to assist in efforts to clean up Agent Orange in Vietnam, it still has not committed any money to helping the victims of the chemical. According to Vietnamese authorities, children are still being born with deformities and health defects three generations after exposure. \"They have not given any money to help victims of dioxin improve their health,\" said Mai The Chinh, head of the Propaganda Board of the Association for Victims of Agent Orange/Dioxin. \"The life of Agent Orange victims is very difficult now.\" The US and Vietnam are also considering a clean up at Bien Hoa, in the southern province of Dong Nai. The airport there is actually more contaminated than Da Nang, according to the Ho Chi Minh City Law newspaper. Phu Cat airport in the central province of Binh Dinh is another heavily contaminated area. The cleanup is a joint project between Vietnam's Defense Ministry and the US Agency for International Development. Work began last year with the clearance of unexploded ordinance from the area surrounding Da Nang. slk/tj (AFP, Reuters, dpa)",

"story": "Israel releases Palestinian prisoners ahead of peace talks Israel has begun the process of releasing 26 Palestinian prisoners ahead of a round of peace negotiations. The Palestinians, though, remain outraged by fresh Israeli plans to build settlement homes. News agencies reported that vehicles carrying the inmates had left the Ayalon prison near Tel Aviv late on Tuesday. Under the planned release, some of the 26 were to be taken from Ayalon to Gaza Strip, while the rest were to be taken from the Ofer military prison to the West Bank. Celebrations were planned in the Palestinian territories and President Mahmoud Abbas planned to receive some of them at his headquarters in Ramallah. The group is meant to be just the first of 104 Palestinian prisoners to be released by Israel under a deal brokered by US Secretary of State John Kerry to get the Palestinians to return to peace negotiations after they had been stalled for the past three years. Most of the prisoners being released are reported to have been convicted of killings, with victims including Israeli civilians, or attempted murder or kidnapping. The release began after Israel's supreme court rejected an appeal earlier in the day, which had been launched by the families of people killed by some of the prisoners. More settlement home construction The Palestinians agreed to the deal despite the fact that Israel refused to halt all settlement construction, something they had long demanded as a pre-condition for talks. Over the past several days though, the Israeli's have approved the construction of hundreds of new homes in settlements on land captured during the 1967 war, which the Palestinians want to make part of a future state. On Tuesday, Israel approved the construction of around 900 housing units in a settlement in east Jerusalem. This followed Israel's announcement on Sunday, that it had approved of plans for 1,200 settlement homes in both east Jerusalem and the West Bank. Israeli plans to build more settlement homes have enraged the Palestinians, particularly as they've come in the lead-up to the first peace talks in years. \"If the Israeli government believes that every week they're going to cross a red line by settlement activity ... what they're advertising is the unsustainability of the negotiations,\" the head of the Palestinian negotiating team, Saeb Erekat, said following Sunday's announcement. Peace talks still a go US Secretary of State Kerry took great pains on Tuesday to stress that the peace talks, to begin at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem on Wednesday, were still on track, despite the tensions over settlements. \"I'll be talking to President Abbas today ... and he is committed to continuing to come to the negotiation because he believes that negotiation is what will resolve this issue,\" Kerry told a press conference in the Brazilian capital, Brasilia. \"But, that said, [Israeli] Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was completely up front with me and with President Abbas that he would be announcing some additional building in places that will not affect the peace map, that will not have any impact on the capacity to have a peace agreement,\" Kerry said.

"story": "Franco-German \"war child\" granted German citizenship The son of a French woman and a German Wehrmacht officer, 66-year-old Daniel Rouxel on Wednesday became the first Franco-German \"war child\" to be granted German citizenship. The French retiree was granted German citizenship at a ceremony at the German consulate in Paris. Rouxel said the event helped to ease a lifetime of rejection and humiliation in a country whose wartime occupation remained a taboo topic for a long time. \"I'm German. I'm not a bastard any more. I'm a child like all the others. At last I've got the second half that I was so cruelly missing,\" Rouxel said. \"Children of the Boche\" Around 200,000 children were born between 1941 and 1945 as a result of liaisons between French women and occupying German troops. At the time, Nazi rules prohibited marriage with French natives - unlike with Norwegians or Dutch who were deemed to be \"Aryan.\" So the affairs were secret and often ended abruptly when they were discovered. After the war, the mothers were humiliated or sent to jail amid a flood of anti-German hostility. Their children were derided as \"children of the Boche\" - an abusive term for Germans. They were often left to struggle alone with the psychological effects of humiliation, rejection, persecution and ostracism. A figure of hate Rouxel's story was no different. He was born in Paris in 1943 during the World War II occupation. His mother worked in the canteen of the German airbase in the Brittany town of Pleurtuit where his father, Lieutenant Otto Ammon, was stationed. Ammon was killed during the Allied liberation of France and after the war, when his mother could no longer cope with raising him, Rouxel was taken in by his grandmother in a small Breton village. As the illegitimate son of the former enemy, Rouxel was a figure of scorn. He was forced by his own grandmother to sleep in a chicken coop and publicly mocked by local officials. Rouxel detailed his accounts in a book published in 2004 in France on the long-neglected generation of Franco-German war-children. Growing up in the Breton village of Megrit in the 1950s, Rouxel remembers the mayor making him stand up in front of the parishioners outside church one Sunday. \"Which one of you knows the difference between a swallow and a Boche?\" the mayor asked. I'll tell you. When the swallow makes its babies here in France, it takes them with it when it leaves. But the Boche - he leaves his behind.\" The incident left its mark on Rouxel. \"I cried a lot. I was only six years old and already I wanted to kill myself,\" he wrote. \"Symbolic significance\" For a long time, officials in both Germany and France refused to address the plight of war children. Recently, the two countries - which are now close allies - signed an agreement to recognize the children's parentage. Earlier this year, Germany said it would be generous in processing the claims by war children for dual citizenship. \"That's an honor for me whose father - a German - was an enemy,\" Rouxel said at the time. \"I idolized him as a child.\" But French historian Fabrice Virgili said he doubted whether the war-children generation - many of whom are well into their 60s - would apply for German citizenship. Virgili said for many of them the gesture was largely symbolic. sp/afp/ap/dpa Editor: Kyle James",

"story": "'The Egyptian revolution is one of the greatest revolutions in history' Alaa Al Aswany is one of Egypt's leading intellectuals and a vocal supporter of the nation's uprising. He spoke to Deutsche Welle about the revolution's success and the tasks Egypt still faces. The dentist turned blacklisted novelist Alaa Al Aswany rose to fame with his 2002 exploration of post-colonial Egyptian society \"The Yacoubian Building.\" He has been one of the leading voices of the Kifaya (\"Enough\") opposition movement for years and joined the revolution on Tahrir Square in January and February. Deutsche Welle: One year ago, Hosni Mubarak was still in charge and no one imagined that mass protests could have ended his presidency. But more than nine months later, Egypt's reform process seems to have come to a standstill. Did the protesters fail? Alaa Al Aswany: Of course I believe that the Egyptian revolution achieved a great thing by forcing one of the most terrible dictators Hosni Mubarak to step down. But since then, I don't think we have been on the right track. All the decisions of the SCAF (Editor's note: Supreme Council of the Armed Forces) - the military council - were not to protect the revolution, but on the contrary, the SCAF has shown the tendency to preserve Mubarak's regime. So we have a very unique situation in Egypt now that Mubarak is no longer in power, but the regime of Mubarak is. The elections showed this. Despite fair voting, they are not fair elections. Voting is just one step of the election procedure. Everything was prepared from the beginning by the SCAF and the elections law to push the Muslim Brotherhood to have a majority. For example, the electoral zones were too big so that the revolutionary youth couldn't afford to participate. Or in one electoral zone we discovered that there were 176 employees who are in charge of the elections and these 176 are founding members of the Muslim Brotherhood. I don't think at all that the coming parliament will represent the Egyptian revolution. You can see that in Egypt, the revolution is still in the street. The revolution of the youth doesn't think this will ever be their parliament. So you agree with some analysts who don't think Egypt has experienced a real revolution. They say only a very small segment of the elite groups have been replaced, meaning the inner circle of the Mubarak regime. But the only new power in the power sharing is the Muslim Brotherhood. Would you agree on that? I think these analysts confuse two things: the revolution and the achievement of the revolution. The term revolution is objective, not an objective. There are two elements to decide if this is a revolution or not: first, the participation of the people. We had more than 20 percent participation in the January revolution. We have more than 20 million people. Second, the aim of the revolution should be the elimination of the old regime. And when I say regime I'm not only talking about political. I'm also talking about the cultural regime, the social regime and the political regime. I believe the Egyptian revolution in this sense was really one of the most typical revolutions by definition in history. I would say the Egyptian revolution was more a revolution than some in Eastern Europe. But the achievement of the revolution is still a long way off. We are talking about nine months here. We're still in the beginning. Still, the Egyptian revolution is one of the greatest revolutions in history - whether the analysts like it or not. What do you think it will take to fulfill the demands of the revolution from January and February? If you compare our revolution to other revolutions you see it takes time. You are eliminating an entire regime and we were not lucky because the military council was not in favor of the revolution. But I am still very optimistic because in the beginning no one could have ever imagined that Mubarak would be forced to step down. We completed the most important and most difficult part of the job, but the revolution is not over. But it is a step ahead because even with these people in the parliament that I don't think are really revolutionary, the Islamic groups, there will at least be no legal position for the SCAF to rule the country. Do you think the country's powerful military will start playing by democratic and parliamentary rules one of these days? The most powerful element in the Egyptian scene is the revolution itself. Here, I have to differentiate between the army and the military council. The military council is the political authority of the army; it is performing the role of the president and the parliament during the transition. The army is something different. It belongs to the Egyptian people and not to the SCAF. There is very strong pressure from the revolution on the streets. The military council is trying to escape from the pressure, the military council at some point gives in and that's what the revolution was. We had to make pressure in the streets to get it. In your most famous book \"The Yacoubian Building\" you described Egyptian society as being dominated by corruption and favoritism. What does it take to change this mentality? How can Egypt establish a spirit of solidarity like people said was felt during the revolution on Tahrir Square? The revolution wasn't just in Tahrir Square. It was in every city in Egypt. I believe that whenever you have this revolutionary attitude in the sense that you are willing to die for your freedom then you will have all the positive things coming out: you will be more courageous, more understanding and less judgmental, you will be less racist; you won't ever judge other people according to their social background or religion. I believe that the revolution as a psychological phenomenon is very positive. When you participate in a real revolution - and that was the case with me - you really become a different person, your experiences and feelings. You see attitudes you never imagined you would. I wrote about 'the people' many times before the revolution but it was only in Tahrir Square that I felt what the meaning of the word 'people' is. You live with two million people on the square for three weeks and they feel they are members of one family So you think this Tahrir Square spirit will be kept alive? Absolutely. It still exists in the streets. You saw it during the massacre against the protesters on November 19. You saw how brave these youths were, how brave the young doctors were. Two of them were killed simply because they wanted to express their political point of view. Do you think Egypt's youth will ever back down again? Up till now, they have the upper hand. I believe it's going to stay this way for a long time. Only when you have a revolution in parliament will Tahrir Square become of secondary importance. But because the coming parliament is not revolutionary, I believe that Tahrir Square will keep saying what we should do in Egypt. Interview: Thomas Kohlmann Editor: Sabina Casagrande/Rob Mudge",

"story": "France's far-right National Front being investigated by EU fraud squad The European Parliament has asked the EU's anti-fraud body to look into possible misuse of funds by the French National Front party. Leader Marine Le Pen has threatened to lodge a complaint over the \"false allegations.\" The investigation centers around 20 members of the National Front, who were paid out of the EU budget for assisting members of the European Parliament, but who allegedly work for the party in France. Assistants receiving wages from the European Parliament must work directly for parliamentary MEPs. On Monday, EU parliament president Martin Schulz informed the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) of the suspected fraud, which some sources say could amount to 7.5 million euros ($8.1 million) over the current legislature, from 2014 to 2019. \"It is not for Parliament to draw conclusions, it is the OLAF to decide in its capacity as the EU anti-fraud agency,\" said European Parliament spokesman Jaume Duch. Schulz has also written to French Justice Minister Christiane Taubira to express his suspicions, the EU body said in a statement. 'Big guns' National Front Vice President Florian Philippot said the allegations were \"trumped up.\" \"In a way, Schulz is right,\" he tweeted. \"Our assistants don't work for the European Union but against it.\" The party's leader, Marine Le Pen (above right), accused the current French prime minister Manuel Valls of \"mobilizing his Socialist friends against the National Front.\" \"The EU parliament's president is bringing out the big guns. A complaint will be filed against him (Martin Schulz) for making false allegations.\" The OLAF will now to decide whether to start an investigation, and it could take several months before a decision is made. Fears of an 'unprecedented' far-right score French Prime Minister Manuel Valls warned during the weekend that the National Front could win the next presidential election in 2017, saying their policies were a \"disaster\" for the country. Polls showed that the far-right party could win an \"unprecedented\" score in local elections on March 22 and 29, Valls said. \"I fear for my country. I fear that it will smash itself to pieces against the Front National,\" Prime Minister Manuel Valls told Europe 1 radio at the weekend. Most political analysts believe that, while Le Pen could reach the runoff round in the 2017 presidential election, it would be far harder for her to defeat the mainstream candidate and win the position. dj/jr (AFP, Reuters, dpa)",

"story": "EU agrees on details of Greece rescue plan, sources say EU leaders have thrashed out the details of an EU-IMF rescue deal that was announced on March 25, according to news agencies quoting unnamed sources. European markets ended the week up on hopes of a detailed rescue plan. European Union member states are said to have reached consensus on the details of a rescue plan for Greece that would allow the debt-laden eurozone member to borrow money from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as well as from individual member states, according to news agencies quoting unnamed diplomatic sources. The EU-IMF plan to help Greece tackle its huge budget deficit was announced on March 25, but details on the financing of the loans envisaged in the deal have yet to be revealed. The agency reports suggest that the EU has agreed on the conditions of any loans made available to Greece, should it ask for them. \"A deal has been reached,\" a source with close knowledge of the discussions told Reuters. \"It is almost a carbon copy of International Monetary Fund terms.\" \"There is agreement on the interest rate which will be applied for Greece, should it call for an aid plan,\" one diplomat told the AFP news agency. \"It is lower than the current market rate for Greek debt,\" another diplomat told AFP. Reassurance Earlier on Friday, several EU leaders reiterated that they were ready to help Greece resolve its massive debt problem. \"The Greek government is courageous and is breaking with the past. We would be ready to intervene if the Greeks ask us to,\" EU President Herman van Rompuy told several European newspapers. French President Nicolas Sarkozy also reaffirmed his commitment to help Athens. \"We are ready to take action at any moment to come to the aid of Greece,\" Sarkozy said after talks with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Germany more cautious Germany also said that the EU-IMF rescue scheme could be activated quickly but government spokesman Michael Offer again stressed that Greece could solve its problem by focusing on budget cutbacks. \"We believe Greece will be able to achieve its objectives by its own means,\" Offer said, pointing to \"encouraging signs\" such as a reduced Greek public deficit in the first quarter of this year. Athens had earlier said that, at this stage, it did not need to activate the rescue deal. Markets react positively After a massive sell-off of Greek bonds and shares on Thursday, European markets ended the week on a high on Friday, in anticipation of a deal. The euro also rose sharply against the US dollar and Greek government bonds reversed some of their losses from Thursday, although spreads to German bunds, the benchmark bonds in the euro zone, remain high. The higher the spreads, the higher the risk for the investor. On Thursday, the European Central Bank (ECB) extended a helping hand to eurozone member Greece, announcing that government bonds would be exempt from tougher penalties when banks use risky collateral. The move increases the incentive for banks to hold Greek bonds, although ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet stressed the rule was not specifically designed with Greece in mind. Athens has promised to slash its deficit by almost one-third, to 8.7 percent of gross domestic product this year. But the government is wary of public opinion after austerity measures prompted a slew of riots and strikes across the country in recent months.

"story": "Berlin's liberal mosque marks 1-year anniversary In the year since its foundation, Berlin's liberal mosque has established itself and is attracting ever greater interest. But lawyer Seyran Ates, who opened the mosque, lives with ongoing hostility and threats. There are 15 chairs in the room. And two men with guns. Bodyguards. This is daily life for Seyran Ates, daily life in the liberal Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque in Berlin. This small Islamic place of worship in Berlin's Moabit district celebrates its first anniversary on Friday. \"A great deal has already happened in the past 12 months,\" says Ates. \"There really is a need for a mosque like this.\" For her, it's all about \"a friendly, spiritual Islam, a contemporary interpretation.\" This was why she named the mosque after the Arab doctor and philosopher Ibn Rushd, also known as Averroes (1126-1198), and the German polymath Johann Wolfgang von Goethe \u2013 two people \"who did a great deal that was positive for Islam in their respective times.\" 'Women and men together' Seyran Ates is a lawyer, a women's rights activist, and a Muslim. Born in Istanbul, this tough, determined Berliner founded the Ibn Rushd-Goethe mosque in June 2017 in a break with many prevailing ideas about Islam. Here, the Koran is read and interpreted from a modern perspective. Women and men pray together. Women and men who are not imams are also allowed to preach here. \"We don't have a permanent male or female imam. In this situation, the imam is whichever person preaches or calls others to prayer.\" What about her critics? \"They don't want to see any renewal in Islam. They don't accept any contemporary readings of the Koran. They want to stop women and men being equal \u2013 praying together in a mosque, for example \u2013 and to prevent Muslim women who don't wear a headscarf from identifying as Muslim women.\" For many Muslims this is revolutionary \u2013 too revolutionary, even. The mosque's location is an indication of just how revolutionary it is \u2013 the third floor of a building next to the Protestant Sankt Johannes Church. Nothing else could be found. It's almost superfluous to mention that the building is under surveillance by security guards. The mosque's one-year rental contract has just been extended for another two. Read more: Islam makes Germany more diverse, scholar says Towards Mecca A white-painted wooden construction stands by one of the walls of the prayer room. Ates explains that it shows worshippers the direction of Mecca, and thus the direction they have to face when praying. \"I've started a course of Islamic Studies,\" she says. \"It really interests me. That's why I'm currently learning Arabic, because I want to be able to have discussions about individual words, as well.\" Ates, who is 55, says the core congregation is around 35 people, but they are all very active and keep the mosque together. There's also a never-ending flood of interest from people around the world who want to visit the building. \"We're overwhelmed with enquiries,\" she says. The mosque has around 750 visitors each month; these often include groups of children or young people, sometimes even mixed groups of Muslim and Jewish children. They recently employed a new member of staff to offer workshops to schools. And Ates already has another project: setting up a new, liberally oriented Islamic academy. 'People are afraid' There has been repeated speculation about similar mosques or reform initiatives in other countries. Ates has been traveling a lot in recent months, to Vienna and Freiburg, London and Copenhagen. \"People are afraid. When it comes to actually putting it into action, that's when people get afraid,\" she says. But she is \"quite sure\" that more liberal mosques will be established. It's certainly obvious that Ates receives a lot of interview requests, including from the foreign media. Seyran Ates knows first-hand just how dangerous her activism for women's rights and against patriarchal structures is. In 1984, when she was still a student, she worked at an advice center for Turkish women in Germany. As she was talking to one of her clients, a man burst into the room, killed the woman, and shot Ates, too. She sustained life-threatening injuries, but survived. Ates expresses disappointment in both German government policy and the policy of the municipal government in Berlin, which wants to establish an Islamic Theology course at the Humboldt University (HU). \"People are preventing liberal Muslims from being invited to the German Islam Conference and joining the HU's advisory board for Islamic Theology. We've implored politicians to do something about this!\" she says. Instead, she continues, the Berlin Senate again turned to the established Muslim organizations, which put it under pressure. The liberal community remains determined: \"We're stirring things up.\" And they will continue to do so. The mosque will be welcoming the vice-president of the Bundestag, Petra Pau (of the Left Party) and the mayor of Berlin, Michael M\u00fcller (SPD) on the occasion of its first anniversary. Ates also talks about other pressures, such as the Muslim man at the door of the mosque who told her, \"In a week's time you'll be gone.\" Or the five men from another established Berlin mosque who came and demanded that the liberal mosque close down. There have been a lot of personal threats online. This is why Ates has bodyguards; and this is why the highest security level applies whenever she makes a public appearance in Germany. \"Your jobs are definitely safe,\" she tells one of her bodyguards, laughing. She hopes she will be able to move freely again in 10 or 15 years' time. \"That's the sort of timescale I'm thinking along.\" Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.

"story": "Gulf Stream system at weakest point in 1,600 years A further weakening of the system of currents in the Atlantic Ocean could wreak havoc on the Earth's climate. But there isn't too much reason to be overly concerned about a looming ice age \u2014 at least not yet.   Two new studies have found that the system of currents in the Atlantic Ocean is exceptionally weak \u2014 and its strength, or lack thereof, could have serious ramifications for the global climate. The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) \u2014 also known as the Gulf Stream system \u2014 is often described as part of the global ocean conveyor belt. It transports warm water from the Atlantic toward the Arctic, which influences the relatively mild climate of Western Europe. In the northern Atlantic, this surface water eventually cools and sinks to the bottom of the ocean, where another current transports it south to Antarctica before circulating back to the Gulf Stream and beginning the cycle anew. This entire process is known as thermohaline circulation. However, a team of researchers from University College London (UCL) and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) have offered evidence from marine sediment that the AMOC is currently at its weakest point in the past 1,600 years. Another study from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) used climate model data and historical records of sea surface temperatures to reveal that the AMOC has been rapidly weakening since 1950 as a result of rising temperatures linked to global warming. Both studies, which will be published together in the April 12 issue of Nature, strongly suggest that the AMOC has weakened over the past by 150 years by at least 15 percent to 20 percent. A new understanding of the climate Scientists have been studying the changes in the AMOC for decades, mostly through the use of computer simulations that predicted the circulation would slow down as a result of global warming. However, the new studies represent the most compelling evidence yet that the AMOC is weakening. David Thornalley, one of the lead researchers of the UCL/WHOI study and senior lecturer at the UCL, said the findings will help scientists understand the longer-term context of how the AMOC is changing. \"We only have very short, direct observations since 2004, and that means it's been very difficult to gain any longer-term perspective of the decline we've been seeing over the last 10 years and if that's part of any longer-term trend,\" he told DW. \"Our study has used new techniques with marine sediment core \u2014 so relatively direct evidence \u2014 to extend, in effect, our observations and allow us to place what's happening today in a longer-term context.\" Levke Ceasar, a PhD student and a researcher with the PIK study, says the results confirm what scientists already assumed about the AMOC. \"Climate models have predicted that the overturning circulation in the Atlantic will slow down due to global warming,\" she told DW. \"Our study shows that yes, it is already happening. Since the mid-20th century we have seen a slowdown of the overturning circulation by about 15 percent.\" Read more: Arctic warmer than Europe is a worrying sign of climate change What does this mean for the planet? As an important component of our planet's climate system, if the AMOC continues to weaken, weather patterns could be disrupted across the United States and Europe, and even the African Sahel region. \"The broader climate system as a whole has a lot of factors and a lot of complexity, and researchers are trying to better understand that,\" Thornalley said. The AMOC is responsible for warming places like northwest Europe by up to 4 to 6 degrees Celsius. \"If that were to weaken, then you would lose that source of heat. Because it transports heat around the globe, it kind of helps determine where climate patterns are.\" For example, if the AMOC weakens, there could be a shift in tropical rainfall belts or strengthening of the winter storms that cross across the Atlantic into Europe. It may also cause a more rapid increase in sea level along the East Coast of the United States due to changes in ocean density. However, Ceasar says the exact impact it may have on the climate is unlear. \"We think that the AMOC may already have an impact on the weather in Europe,\" she told DW. \"For example, the 2015 European heat wave has been linked to cold [sea surface] temperatures in the sub-polar Atlantic.\" Although this sounds like a paradox, it happens since \"low, sub-polar sea surface temperatures change the air pressure distribution that channels warm air into Europe and can lead to heat waves,\" she explained. Read more: Climate change and extreme weather: Science is proving the link Worst-case scenario Scientists don't necessarily think the Earth could enter a new ice age as a result of the Gulf Stream. In fact, the theory that the Little Ice Age, which occurred between 1460 and 1550, was linked to the weakening of the AMOC has been disproven by the latest study from UCL/WHOI. A worst-case scenario, however, could result in a complete shutdown of the AMOC. Farfetched though it may seem, scientists have said that based on what they know, this is not a totally impossible scenario. \"The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change research says a complete shutdown has something like a 5 to 10 percent chance of happening by 2100,\" Thornalley said. There are still improvements to be made in our understanding of the system, he added. \"There is a possibility that a shutdown could occur, and that is why we invest money into monitoring this system. Although it may be unlikely, if it did happen, it would have very severe consequences.\" Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.

Alcohol is thought to have played a role in the clashes. Police in the German city of Darmstadt came under attack from groups of assailants overnight to Sunday, with 15 officers suffering injuries. Initial police reports said that 80 people, many of them drunk, were arrested after the violence broke out at the end of a popular open-air music festival. According to police, people began throwing bottles at officers without warning as the festival concluded and also carried out acts of vandalism, including setting alight a container for donated clothing. They said reinforcements were brought in to help quell the violence. \"The reason for the violent acts is still unclear. Investigations [...] are ongoing,\" police said. Read more: German police shortages 'threaten rule of law' Call for stiffer sentences The interior minister of the state of Hesse, Peter Beuth, condemned the attacks, calling for the minimum sentence for such offenses to be raised from three months to six months. Such attacks did not just represent an offense against police, but also \"against our constitutional state and our society,\" Beuth said. He said he would bring up the subject of tightening the laws regarding attacks on security forces at a conference of national and state interior ministers that is scheduled to start on Wednesday.

"story": "Russian court sentences Ukrainian pilot Nadezhda Savchenko to 22 years for murder The Ukrainian pilot received her sentence a day after being found guilty by a Russian court over the killing of two journalists. Savchenko has been at the center of the conflict between Kyiv and pro-Moscow separatists. The 34-year-old Savchenko was sentenced to 22 years in jail after the court found her guilty of giving the coordinates used in an attack that killed two journalists who worked for the Russian state TV broadcaster VGTRK. Savchenko has become one of the most famous faces of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine after she was taken into custody by pro-Moscow rebels in June 2014. Following her arrest, Kyiv granted her diplomatic immunity by appointing her as a representative to the Council of Europe. However, Moscow argued she still had to stand trial, as the alleged crime occurred after the appointment was made. She has denied any wrongdoing, and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has called on Moscow to return her to the country. Russian officials have suggested they are open to handing Savchenko over as part of a prisoner swap. The pilot responded to the sentencing in court by singing aloud the Ukrainian national anthem. Complicit in murder Savchenko was also found guilty of illegally crossing the Russian border. On Monday, the Russian court declared that Savchenko, \"having skills of military training, and experience in military actions in Iraq, while on a holiday, on her own choice in order to participate in the armed conflict in Ukraine's southeast, came to the Aidar batallion under commander Sergey Melnichuk, which was located in the town of Schastye in the Luhansk region.\" The court said Melnichuk was primarily responsible for the killings, and that he'd supplied the pilot with the gear and equipment. Savchenko has called the accusations a \"lie,\" something also echoed by both Brussels and Washington, who believe the pilot was abducted by pro-Moscow rebels and falsely charged. Russia has been accused of backing the rebellion in the eastern part of the country, which erupted after demonstrators forced President Viktor Yanukovich out of office in February 2014.

"story": "Top Kurdish rights defender in Turkey shot and killed A prominent Kurdish lawyer and human rights defender has been killed in Turkey after making a pro-peace press statement in the city of Diyarbakir. It is unclear who was behind the attack. Tahir Elci, the head of the Diyarbakir Bar Association, was shot in the head on Saturday after delivering a press statement with other lawyers and activists condemning violence in the region. A critic of both the government and Kurdish militants, Elci had minutes before delivered a speech calling for the end of the fighting between the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Turkish state. Some of his last words were: \"We don't want guns, clashes and military operations in our region.\" Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast has been wracked by violence since a ceasefire and peace process between the state and the PKK broke down in July. Pro-PKK youth groups have erected barricades in cities and neighborhoods across the region, prompting harsh security crackdowns and curfews. Several hundred soldiers, PKK fighters and civilians have been killed in the renewed fighting. A video released by Turkey's DHA news agency shows police returning gunfire down a small street from unknown assailants after Elci and others had delivered a pro-peace message near a local mosque that had been damaged in prior clashes. Police then turned around to where Elci was and fired multiple rounds in that direction. The video shows his body laying facedown on the ground. A policeman was also killed and several people wounded. The governor of Diyarbakir has called a curfew in expectation there will be widespread protests against Elci's death. It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack, but Turkish media outlets citing witnesses reported that the assailant had a beard. Turkish media reported that after firing one shot to Elci's head the assailant fled. Investigators at the scene were later fired upon, wounding two police officers. Speculation of who is behind the attack will be rife, with different sides already blaming the PKK, the Turkish state and Islamists. The Diyarbakir Bar Association on Twitter claimed it was an assassination. State media Anadolu Ajansi suggested the PKK carried out the attack. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the incident in Diyarbakir showed Turkey was justified in its struggle against terrorism. \"We will carry out this struggle to the end, there is no stopping,\" he said. Elci was charged last month on terrorism related charges for saying on a CNN Turk program that the PKK was not a terrorist organization. Selahattin Demirtas, the co-chair of the pro-Kurdish HDP party, alleged last week that an unknown gunman attempted to assassinate him when a bullet hit the back window of his car as he was driving in Diyarbakir. Turkish police later claimed it was not a bullet. Demirtas has insisted it was an assassination attempt. The killing of Elci follows an October twin suicide bombing in Ankara blamed on the \"Islamic State\" (IS) that killed more than 100 people at a leftists and Kurdish peace rally.",

"story": "New Bollywood film sparks storm A new Bollywood film tackling the issue of caste quotas in government jobs and education has raised a storm for its alleged anti-reservation stance. The state government of Uttar Pradesh has banned it for two months. The government of the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh has banned a controversial Hindi film called \"Aarakshan\" (Reservation) just two days before it is due to be released. The decision to ban the film, which was due to hit the screens on Friday, was taken after a recommendation by a high-level official committee that had been set up by the government of Uttar Pradesh that is run by Dalit leader Mayawati. After watching the movie, the official committee said that it felt its screening would create a \"law and order problem\" in the state. The committee said it was of the view that the film's dialogues could create hatred and adverse reaction in society. Uttar Pradesh is a populous state whose population is largely made up of Dalits (previously known as \"Untouchables\"), Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. After UP, the Punjab government has banned the screening of Aarakshan in the state. The ban will stay until the state screening committee previews the movie and submits its report. Affirmative action The head of India's National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) even said that the film by Prakash Jha was \"anti-Dalit and anti-reservation.\" After watching a special screening in New Delhi, the NCSC asked the Censor Board to make necessary changes in the film before it is released, objecting to the \"derogatory way\" the Backward community is featured. Reservation refers to the policy of guaranteeing jobs for India's socially disadvantaged groups. The affirmative action aims to provide equal opportunities for the poorest and most marginalized in the country's complex and deeply entrenched social hierarchy. Those who miss out on public sector jobs or education places as a result say the system fails to reward talent or ability. In Mumbai, publicity material was vandalized and more than a dozen activists were arrested for protesting outside director Prakash Jha's office, prompting police to give him and the films leading actors extra security. Protests were also held in Rajasthan and Punjab. Director's take The director, whose previous films have tackled social issues, corruption and power politics, has rejected all criticism of the film and denies taking a stance. \"In India, there are people who benefit from the reservation policy and those who have missed an opportunity because of it. Reservation and the quota system is a hard-hitting reality. It is almost an India versus India situation and by showing this in my movie, I am trying to bridge the gap,\" the 59-year-old told reporters. A nine-member team of the Censor Board had previously given a certificate to the film without any cuts. On Wednesday, it said it would defend Jha's right to free expression and added that \"Aarakshan\" would be released on August 12 despite the NCSC plea to make cuts.

"story": "South African finance minister Pravin Gordhan sacked in cabinet reshuffle A major cabinet reshuffle in South Africa has the potential to widen rifts within the ruling ANC. President Jacob Zuma is under renewed pressure to step down.  South African President Jacob Zuma sacked his popular finance minister late Thursday as part of a larger cabinet reshuffle which could deepen divisions within the ruling ANC party and spook investors. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, who has clashed with Zuma for months over graft and public spending, was replaced by Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba, a relatively unknown figure with little finance experience. Zuma also made changes at 10 of the country's 35 ministries, including energy, police and tourism. Some of the ministers are newcomers, while others were moved to new portfolios. \"I have directed the new ministers and deputy ministers to work tirelessly with their colleagues to bring about radical socioeconomic transformation and to ensure that the promise of a better life for the poor and the working class becomes a reality,\" Zuma said in a statement. The mid-night announcement sent the rand lower, extending losses from earlier this week that were triggered by speculation Gordhan would be replaced after Zuma recalled him from a trade trip in London. Investors are concerned that Zuma will now be unrestrained in government spending. Gordhan is widely respected by international investors and domestically for his tough stance on corruption and budget discipline at a time the country faces possible credit rating downgrades. Those positions have brought Gordhan up against Zuma allies who argue he was blocking efforts to tackle inequality. The cabinet reshuffle comes amid a split within the ruling African National Congress and growing calls for Zuma to step down over corruption and mismanagement. A number of senior ANC officials had sided with Gordhan in a months-long dispute with Zuma and warned against replacing him. \"We view this as an open attack on Treasury to replace people who are conservative and anti-corruption with people loyal to Zuma,\" said Peter Attard Montalto, analyst at Nomura bank. \"Zuma is taking a risk here and the next step is to watch what happens with resignations.\" The South African Communist Party, which is in an alliance with the ANC, warned that the party's seven cabinet members would resign if Zuma replaced his finance minister. Divisions within the ANC were on display earlier this week at the funeral of anti-apartheid activist Ahmed Kathrada, a critic of Zuma. The funeral turned into a political demonstration as Gordhan received a standing ovation and several longtime leaders of the ANC called on Zuma to step down. The president did not attend the funeral at the request of Kathrada's family. The party that spearheaded the anti-apartheid struggle has lost popularity due to corruption allegations, unemployment and poor economic growth. The scandal-plagued Zuma is under increasing pressure to resign. \"Zuma has bowed to the whims of those who determined to enrich themselves at the expense of the poor & jobless,\" the Democratic Alliance, the country's main opposition said. The party said it would call for a no-confidence vote in Zuma in parliament Also on Thursday, leftist opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party applied to the country's top court to request parliament begin impeachment proceedings against Zuma for lying to the legislature. Last year, the court found Zuma guilty of breaking the constitution after he refused to repay money for upgrades to his home. He is also battling a court order to prevent the reemergence of almost 800 corruption charges over an arms deal in the 1990s. The president is also accused of having unscrupulous ties with wealthy Gupta business family. He has allegedly given them influence over appointing ministers and provided special treatment for contracts. In November, the president survived an attempt by senior party officials to oust him. Gordhan, who was finance minister between 2009 to 2014, took back the portfolio in December 2015 after Zuma unsettled markets by firing two other finance ministers within four days. Late last year, fraud charges against Gordhan were dropped. Many pointed to the charges being politically motivated. cw/bw (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)",

"story": "Saudi-led warplanes pound Yemen after ceasefire ends The Saudi Arabia-led coalition has resumed airstrikes in Sanaa, hours after a three-day truce expired in Yemen. The ceasefire was declared in order to supply crucial humanitarian aid to civilians. Yemen's government continued to blame Shiite Houthi rebels for not upholding the 72-hour truce, forcing the Saudi-led coalition to strike targets in the capital, Sanaa. \"The [Houthi] coup militias deliberately thwarted the truce, and that further convinced our military and political leadership of their unwillingness to accept peace,\" Yemen's army chief of staff Mohammed Ali al-Miqdashi told reporters. Airstrikes were reported from military sites near Sanaa, in the Hafa camp towards the east and the Nahdein area in the south. Planes also targeted the Houthi-controlled city of Hodeida and Taiz, the Reuters news agency reported residents as saying. Fierce fighting was also reported in the country's northern regions along the border with Saudi Arabia. Ten rebels and four Yemeni soldiers were killed over the weekend, media agencies reported. The strikes occurred hours before UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmad, arrived in Sanaa for talks with Houthi representatives. Ahmad had earlier appealed for an extension of the truce to enable humanitarian aid to reach war-ravaged areas. \"We noted over the last days that food and humanitarian supplies were provided to several affected neighborhoods and that UN personnel were able to reach areas that were previously inaccessible,\" Ahmad said on Saturday. He had appealed to parties to extend the ceasefire, which began on Wednesday, for another 72 hours. But Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdulmalek al-Mekhlafi said the call was \"useless\" because rebels were ignoring the truce. \"We respect the UN envoy's call for an extension, but in effect, there was no truce due to the violations\" by the rebels, Mekhlafi told the Agence France-Presse news agency. Nearly 7,000 people have died since early last year, when Saudi Arabia formed a coalition to prevent Iran-backed Shiite Houthi rebels from deposing President Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi and taking over the country. Hadi is now in exile in Riyadh. The war has plunged the country into chaos, with millions facing starvation and an acute shortage of medical supplies. mg/jlw (AFP, Reuters)",

"story": "Russia calls UN Security Council meeting on Yemen strike pause The UN Security Council will meet on Saturday at Russia's instigation to discuss the situation in Yemen. Moscow is proposing a pause in Saudi-led airstrikes in the country. The meeting was called amid growing concern over the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, which is experiencing a rising civilian death toll from fierce fighting. A Saudi Arabia-led campaign, which began on March 26, has pounded key locations across Yemen with airstrikes in an attempt to halt an advance of Shiite Houthi fighters. Riyadh maintains the Houthis are backed by Iran. The Houthis are allied with former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was forced out in the country's 2011 Arab Spring uprising. The latest fighting prompted President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to flee to Saudi Arabia last week. Aid agencies have reported that more than 500 people have been killed and three times as many injured in the past two weeks. Russia's mission to the UN said it called the meeting of the 15-member Council to \"discuss an issue of humanitarian pause during coalition airstrikes in Yemen.\" The Houthis seized power in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, in February, with Hadi declaring a provisional capital in his stronghold Aden, a southern port city. The UN backs Hadi as the legitimate leader of Yemen. Saudi Arabia and several regional allies have vowed to continue the airstrikes until the Houthis \"withdraw and surrender their weapons.\" Russia's proposal came as several Gulf countries called for a UN resolution imposing sanctions and an arms embargo on the Houthis.

"story": "The New York Wheel is growing  Construction on the world's tallest observation wheel is progressing in New York City. The gigantic attraction will, however, be significantly more expensive and its completion delayed.   On a tour of the site in the borough of Staten Island, spokeswoman Tiffany Townsand said that the budget is currently 590 million dollars (about 555 million euros). That would make the New York Wheel more than twice as expensive as originally planned. At first its developers announced total costs of 250 million dollars and an opening date in 2015. Now the wheel is expected to start turning in spring 2018. A shopping mall, hotels, public parking garage and green areas will surround the planned attraction. The project's developers hope it will enhance the most suburban and least populated of the city's five boroughs. To this day, many tourists take the free ferry ride to Staten Island in order to enjoy the view of Upper New York Bay, the Statue of Liberty and the city skyline, but they usually go straight back to Manhattan. It's hoped that the New York Wheel will attract three million visitors annually and that they will spend time on the island's north shore. Right now, it would be the tallest observation wheel in the world, but because several similar projects are in the planning, its height could be exceeded before it's finished. At present the record-holder is the High Roller Ferris wheel in Las Vegas, Nevada, at just under 170 meters. The New York Wheel is expected to take 38 minutes for one rotation and accommodate up to 40 passengers in each of its 36 transparent capsules. Three capsules will have built-in bars and one will be a dining capsule. The new attraction was designed by Starneth B.V. - the company that built the London Eye in 1999. The 135-meter-tall wheel in the UK capital is visited by 3.5 million tourists a year. is/cho/ms (dpa, afp, newyorkwheel.com)",

"story": "Klitschko knocks out Chambers to keep heavyweight crown World heavyweight boxing champion Vladimir Klitschko has knocked out US challenger Eddie Chambers to retain his three titles. Vladimir Klitschko knocked out US challenger Eddie Chambers to retain his three heavyweight boxing titles late Saturday in front of 51,000 fans in Duesseldorf's soccer stadium. The 33-year-old Ukrainian boxer saved the best for last, landing his knockout punch five seconds before the end of the 12-round fight to defend his WBO, IBF and IBO heavyweight titles. After a furious final round \"Fast Eddie\" Chambers slumped to the canvas, finally succumbing to Klitschko's poweful punches. Chambers needed a few minutes to recover from the pounding he received at the end of the title bout. Klitschko dominated the fight and ended it with a left hook to score his 48th KO in 53 professional fights. Ahead of the bout he had promised to \"make a statement.\" \"Eddie Chambers was damn quick, but without the support by the fans in Duesseldorf, the 12th round wouldn't have ended like it did. Thank you,\" said the former Olympic boxing champion as he celebrated in the ring with a bottle of local beer. Klitschko, weighing in at 111 kilograms (245 pounds), had a chance of knocking down Chambers early on in the second round with a combination of solid jabs and straight punches, but Chambers, who weighed in at 95 kilograms (209 pounds) stood his ground. This was Chamber's second defeat in 37 fights with 18 knockouts. nrt/dpa/Reuters Editor: Holly Fox",

"story": "How to combat osteoporosis? Osteoporosis dramatically rises in Western Europe. Women are afflicted more than men. Patients can, however, take action themselves. We talk to sports scientist Dr. J\u00fcrgen Siebenh\u00fcnen. DW: Why do so many people get osteoporosis, and why is the proportion of women so high? J\u00fcrgen Siebenh\u00fcnen: One frequent factor is genetic predisposition, i.e. the illness being passed on by the mother. The main reason for a growing risk of osteoporosis among women is the change in hormone levels during the menopause, who leads to an oestrogen deficiency. As the oestrogen level sinks, bone loss accelerates rapidly by up to 4% per year. Women lose an average of 40% of their bone mass between the ages of 40 and 70. The figure for men is only 12% - although younger men are now catching up, due primarily to unhealthy lifestyles that can favor development of the illness. Insufficient exercise, sweetened drinks, candy, yeast, preserved meat products, pickled meat and above all beer help to reduce bone mass. Can a healthy diet therefore have a positive impact? Faulty diets are indisputably a major factor behind the onset of osteoporosis. Patients should consult a professional dietician to get a formal appraisal of their eating habits. Dietary profiles help to identify faulty nutrition and possible deficiencies in vital nutrients. They also detect dietary sins that are frequently linked to a reduction of calcium levels, and which can be replaced gradually by healthier options. A diet that is balanced and geared to the patient can make a big contribution to relieving symptoms. Which foods do you recommend for osteoporosis patients? Firstly: all varieties of cheese, due to their high calcium content. Then: milk and dairy products, vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, all types of cabbage, fennel, wholegrain bread, and fruit. Mineral water that is high in calcium but low in sodium. But while your diet is important, an appropriate workout program remains essential. Do you have an ideal workout program for osteoporosis patients? Sports and workout programs should include exercises that exert pulling pressure on the bones. As impact on the body is also important, working out on a power plate (a rapidly oscillating platform) is very effective. It has been shown that this kind of workout can replenish bone mass and density. Workouts should be carried out on a regularly basis, however, in order to effectively combat osteoporosis. Doing the odd exercise once will not be enough. In addition to special power training with relatively short but very intensive exercises, endurance sports such as jogging and walking are an important component of any proper training program. To maximize the effect on bones, the workout intensity should be raised gradually, and should in any case exceed everyday demands. Finally: workout programs of this nature should only be performed with professional assistance. Dr. J\u00fcrgen Siebenh\u00fcnen is a sports scientist who runs health management seminars, a sports rehabilitation expert and personal trainer. http://www.siebenhuenen-gesundheit.de",

"story": "UN: Cyprus reunification talks to resume The leaders of ethnically-split Cyprus have agreed to restart peace talks in a bid to reunify the island. The election of a moderate leftist Turkish Cypriot has raised hopes of a breakthrough after 40 years of division. A United Nations envoy said the leaders planned to resume the stalled talks on Friday May 15, seizing a \"unique opportunity\" for peace on an island that's been divided along ethnic lines since 1974. Diplomat Espen Barth Eide made the announcement after hosting a dinner between Greek Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades and newly-elected Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci. \"They agreed it was important to use the momentum created and opportunity to move forward without delay,\" Eide told journalists in the capital Nicosia. It was the first meeting between the two leaders since Akinci, a moderate leftist and reunification advocate, defeated veteran nationalist Dervis Eroglu in elections last month. It's believed the leadership change could give new momentum to reunification efforts. Eide, a former foreign minister for Norway, said Friday's talks would involve a \"general exchange of views\" and address the structure of future negotiations. \"I think this is a unique opportunity that will be grasped and it's truly rewarding to work with two leaders with such a strong commitment to seeing a shared challenge that can only be solved through shared effort.\" Four-decade split The Mediterranean island split into a Turkish North and a Greek-supported South in 1974, when the Turkish army invaded, itself in response to a coup seeking a union with Greece. Since then, there have been a number of failed attempts at peace. In October, Greek Cypriots walked away from UN-brokered talks in protest of Turkish exploration of the island's offshore oil and gas reserves. Although the rival sides agree that there should be a two-state federation, negotiations have stalled on issues such as territorial adjustments, security, property rights of internally displaced people, and power sharing. Turkey supports Northern Cyprus militarily and financially, and is the only country to recognize it as a separate state. The Greek Cypriot leadership theoretically represents the whole island in the European Union, although it technically only governs the south. nm/msh (Reuters, AP, AFP)",

"story": "German media: indication that German co-pilot 'rehearsed' crashing the plane The co-pilot of the Germanwings plane had put the aircraft into an unnecessary descent on the way to Barcelona, before the doomed flight back to D\u00fcsseldorf, a German newspaper says. The crash killed 150 people. Ahead of Wednesday's expected release of an interim report on the Germanwings crash, German mass-circulation newspaper Bild reported that flight data from the day of the deadly plane crash suggested that the young co-pilot had practiced downing the aircraft. The 27-year old co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, allegedly put the plane into a \"controlled, technically unjustified dive, which lasted several minutes\" while traveling to Barcelona on the day of the crash, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the French BEA agency, which is in charge of investigating aviation accidents. He is suspected of intentionally flying the plane with 150 people on board into a mountainside in France during the return flight on March 24. The newspaper also speculated that the dive might not have been just a practice run, and that the co-pilot might have wanted to crash the plane on the way to Barcelona. A BEA spokeswoman confirmed to the DPA news agency that an interim report on the accident is set to be published online Wednesday, but did not immediately comment on the content. Signed off sick Lubitz had suffered from severe depression and received treatment for \"suicidal tendencies\" before obtaining his pilot's license, German authorities have said. Although doctors had no indication that the co-pilot intended to harm himself or others, he was signed off sick from work a number of times, including on the day of the crash. He apparently decided to cover that up. In addition, German investigators found that he had researched methods of suicide and ways of blocking the cockpit door online. The captain is heard no the audio from the flight unsuccessfully trying to force his way back in after briefly leaving the cabin. All the 150 people in the aircraft were killed in the crash. dj/kms (dpa, Reuters)",

"story": "ABC faces job cull over budget cuts The Australian Broadcasting Corporation has warned hundreds of jobs are likely to be slashed after government funding cuts. Opposition leaders said reduced funding was retaliation for unfavorable coverage. More than 400 jobs could be lost at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, ABC Managing Director Mark Scott said Monday. \"We anticipate that more than 400 people - close to 10 percent of our ongoing workforce - face potential redundancy as we adjust our activities over coming months,\" Scott said in a statement. The government currently provides the ABC and ethnic broadcaster SBS some 1.4 billion Australian dollars ($1.2 billion, 970 million euros) annually, but Canberra announced last week the budget would be cut by 254 million Australian dollars over the next five years. Scaling back infrastructure Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the ABC should be able to fund those cuts through efficiencies and without sacrificing programming. ABC Managing Director Mark Scott said the station would have to review its property holdings, with one Sydney site to be sold and an Adelaide TV production studio and five regional radio stations facing closure. Opposition leader Bill Shorten said the cuts were \"retaliation for unfavorable coverage of the government.\" Prime Minister Tony Abbott had earlier been quoted as saying the ABC \"takes everyone's side but Australia's\" in its news coverage. hg/cjc (dpa, AFP)",

"story": "Julian Weigl: 'Last year I played a bit too safe' After a rapid rise in his first Bundesliga season, Julian Weigl is expected to deliver again in his second. DW spoke to the BVB star about that pressure and what he plans to change this time around. Second albums are hard to get right, especially if the first was a hit. Julian Weigl's first season on the big stage certainly was one. Out of nowhere, a player seemingly signed as a prospective talent became the central pivot of Thomas Tuchel's midfield. Now, ahead of his second, Weigl has the pressure of delivering again, and delivering again is just what the Bavaria native has in mind. \"I think it's important not to let up or give that little bit less because you think you've alleady proved yourself,\" Weigl told DW. \"Many athletes can have a good year, but the important thing is to perform consistently on the pitch. Now it is time to do more to prove my performance.\" Dressed for a training session that doesn't start for a while, it's easy to see Weigl's hard-working mindset is more than just an attitude. His father got him into football and while Julian always went to his father's games, he didn't watch because he was too busy playing himself. While he's still got his flashes of youth - the handshake is more friendly than formal and Drake is his one of his favorite artists - he's just as calm in person as he appears when three players are trying to close him down in midfield. At the start of September Weigl will turn 21 years old. For a man of his age, he's proved so much that his final year as a teenager must feel like a lifetime ago. Since then, he has left his old life in Bavaria for a new one as a Borussia player, after the club bought him from second-divison side 1860 Munich for an understated 2.5 million euros ($2.8 million). Weigl made over 50 club appearances, and even made his Germany debut before joining the Euro 2016 squad. Weigl has eased into top-level football with remarkable composure. The youngster admitted that this year had gone went quickly for him, though, and that a recent holiday in the United States with his girlfriend was a welcome chance to get away and take stock. \"I arrived [at Dortmund] knowing no one and it changed drastically from one week to the next and of course, you want to have moments when you can eat alone and be a nobody.\" In a Dortmund team that lost its spine this summer, Weigl has become more than just another member of the team. His role this season will be huge, as BVB welcome a host of new faces and the return of the Champions League. \"The Champions League is the most awesome competition out there,\" Weigl said, clearly excited at the prospect of playing at the top level of club football. \"We lost three important players, so it was obvious we would need to dip into the market. But I trusted the club because they've always signed good players. When Robert Lewandowski left, we got Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang,' Henrikh Mkhitaryan came in for link:19416307:Mario G\u00f6tze.\"# The temptation the second time around for both Tuchel and Weigl will be to offer something new, but the midfielder isn't tempted to stray too far from what has made him so successful. \"My strength is how I played last year and I'm hoping to prove that and take it to the next level by making fewer mistakes and improving my weaknesses. There were perhaps a few games last year when I played a bit too safe. I want to operate a little more offensively, so I can deliver an assist from time to time.\" As Weigl grows as a footballer, it's exciting to think what kind of player he's developing into. \"Last year was my first year so you don't always trust yourself to make the killer pass. I think taking last year's form, perhaps I can take the next step, to take more players out of the play with my passes and be more attacking.\" Weigl is a model professional. He genuinely trains hard and when the name Dirk Nowitzki came up, it became abundantly clear that this is no ordinary 20-year-old. \"Dirk Nowitzki talked about Kobe Bryant being a workaholic. It's those things make you think: 'I won't just spend today on the sofa. I won't do it tomorrow, I'll do it now.'\" And it's hard not to believe Weigl is becoming a better play today. He's also working with the physio team to keep in shape and he even said that he tries \"to live professionally.\" His focus on diet is also impressive. He's been working on a plan to put on some bulk and it seems to be going well. \"It's clear that I'm not going to be a Mats Hummels or a Sokratis, and I might lose a bit of my style of play if I did, but one, two, three kilograms (6.6 pounds) would help.\" Time with the Germany squad this summer has helped Weigl. He said Toni Kroos' passing quality and Bastian Schweinsteiger's work ethic left an impression on him. At Dortmund, he goes to Sokratis for tackling help and Aubameyang for finishing, something that he's keen to improve. Dortmund fans will be hoping that he will stay with the club for a long time. His current contract ends in 2019, but Weigl was non-committal when asked about his future. \"I don't make five-year plans. I just want to keep building on last year's performances,\" he said. Weigl's affection for 1860 means there's no chance of him following the recent trend of swapping yellow and black for the red of Bayern. The rest of Europe will be on guard, but for now Dortmund fans can look forward to another successful album from their midfield maestro.",

"story": "Bayern's Uli Hoeness hopes for March release from prison A court in Augsburg, Bavaria, is examining whether Uli Hoeness should be freed on probation at the mid-way point of his sentence. The longstanding Bayern Munich boss is serving three and a half years for tax evasion. From February 29 next year, Bayern Munich's former commercial manager and president, Uli Hoeness, could be fully released on parole - less than two years after his conviction for tax evasion. An Augsburg court on Tuesday confirmed that it had received an application to consider Hoeness for release at the half-way point of his sentence. \"After hearing from the convicted, the chamber will have to decide whether the legal conditions for this have been fulfilled,\" the court said in a press release. Spokesman Claus P\u00e4tzel said that a decision was highly unlikely before mid-January. Hoeness' lawyer first said in November that his client would seek the release, often dubbed a \"half sentence\" in German legal circles. Hoeness was sentenced in March 2014, after dramatically confessing to tax evasion worth some 28.5 million euros ($31.2 million at today's exchange) in court. Much of the money hailed from successful speculation on the stock markets, he said. The 63-year-old Hoeness has already been granted day-release prisoner status; he works with Bayern Munich's youth setup during the days, spending five nights a week at an open prison in Rothenfeld. He's permitted to spend most weekends in his family home at the lakeside town of Tegernsee, south of Munich. Home for Christmas, listening to Adele Hoeness, who has three days off work at the Bayern academy for the festive period, offered Bavarians something of a status update on Monday, calling private radio station \"Antenne Bayern\" to say how important it was to him to be able to spend Christmas with his family. He and his wife Susi had agreed \"that we will not give each other gifts, because I can be at home,\" Hoeness said. \"That's enough of a present.\" He also donated 10,000 euros to a charitable cause on air, requesting that the station play \"Hello\" by UK popstar Adele; Hoeness dedicated the donation and song to \"my beloved wife Susi, my children and my son- and daughter-in-law,\" saying that they had made it possible for him \"to get through this difficult time.\" Various factors could speak in Hoeness' favor for early release. His 2014 conviction was his first offense, and according to recent reports from the \"Bild\" newspaper, he has repaid his outstanding taxes plus interest. msh/pfd (dpa, SID)",

"story": "Hungary's Orban attempts to secure his position For months, Hungarian opposition parties and civil rights groups had protested the plan - to no avail. Lawmakers have voted in favor of controversial electoral reforms. Under the new electoral regulations, Hungarian voters must register if they want to cast their ballot in future. The governing coalition argues the new legislation will simplify drawing up voter lists. The opposition parties in parliament, however, criticize mandatory voter pre-registration as a covert constraint on electoral rights, arguing it keeps less affluent, poorly educated or undecided people away from the ballot boxes. \"It's an attempt by Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his Fidesz party to anchor their election victory,\" Peter Juhasz, civil rights activist and head of the extra-parliamentary Milla group, told DW. The ruling passed on Monday evening (26.11.2012) requires voters to register personally every four years at the municipal office in their district or via the Internet, should they have an electronic signature. In the latter case, Hungarians eligible to vote must obtain a personal authorization beforehand. Registration is due at the latest two weeks before election day and is valid for parliamentary, local and European elections as well as for referendums. Ethnic Hungarians living in other countries, including the roughly three million-strong Hungarian minorities in Romania, Serbia, Slovakia and Ukraine that have been allowed to voter by list since 2010, can register via letter. The new legislation also restricts election campaign practices: in future, parties and candidates will not be allowed to campaign on private radio and television stations or local print media. Last year, the constituency boundaries were redrawn and the number of delegates in parliament was cut by 50 percent. Critics argue the reform favors large parties like Fidesz. Slap in the face The new legislation has been a topic of heated debate for months. Opposition politicians, legal and electoral experts said there is no need for voter registration. They argued that Hungary, unlike countries that use pre-registration like the United States, has a central population register. Ahead of the vote in parliament Monday, the ruling Fidesz party emphatically rejected criticism of the electoral reform. It is \"inacceptable\", Gergely Gulyas said, that the electoral reform should be labelled anti-democratic or contrary to the rule of law. Jozsef Tobias, deputy parliamentary leader of the Socialist opposition party (MSZP) termed the reform a \"slap in the face of democracy.\" His colleague Tamas Harangozo called it a \"pedantic and inane attempt to influence the election outcome.\" Opposition parties and several civil rights groups have announced fresh marches and protests against the electoral reform. Egy\u00fctt 2014 (Together 2014), an election coalition that includes leading opposition politicians, intellectuals, unionists and civil rights activists - among them the Milla group - plans a nationwide campaign to urge voters to register in large numbers ahead of election. They say that is the only way to win elections and abolish mandatory registration. Orban fears for his power Editorial writers in media critical of the government have slammed the reform as an effort by the ruling Fidesz party to counterbalance a significant loss of popularity over the past two years and to secure good election results in the long run. Orban's government cultivates a nationalist, populist and anti-capitalist rhetoric while at the same time pursuing drastic austerity policies that have mainly hit people with in lower-income bracket and retirees. That has led to Fidesz' sharp decline in opinion polls; currently, the party is far from a two-thirds majority. The electoral reform is \"Fidesz' granite foundation\", according to Hungary's left-liberal daily Nepszabadsag. And Hungary's most popular Internet news service, index.hu, has the following comment: \"Elections are the most important event in a civil democracy, they are the system's festival. They are the moment when all citizens have the same chance to shape fate in their native country. Limiting this chance is a despicable gesture. Since Monday evening, Hungary is a much worse place than it ever was since 1990.\"",

"story": "Deadly sectarian violence continues in Myanmar Sectarian violence has broken out in western Myanmar, leaving dozens dead. The United Nations has called for calm amid the ongoing clashes which have destroyed thousands of homes over five days. Nearly sixty people have died as a result of ongoing violence between Rohingya Muslims and Buddhists in Myanmar, which persisted Thursday for a fifth day. The western state of Rakhine has suffered the brunt of the conflict. According to Rakhine state spokesman Win Myaing, 25 men and 31 women were reported dead as of 7 p.m. local time in four townships. Myaing added that 1,900 homes had also been burned down. Security forces have struggled to quell the unrest in Myanmar since violence broke out in June. At least 80 have died as a result of the conflict, and around 75,000 people have been displaced. UN 'gravely concerned' The UN called for an end to the violence, saying that the struggle has forced thousands of displaced refugees into \"already overcrowded\" camps near the state capital of Sittwe. \"The UN is gravely concerned about reports of a resurgence of inter-communal conflict in several areas in Rakhine State which has resulted in deaths and has forced thousands of people, including women and children to flee their homes,\" said Ashok Nigam, UN humanitarian coordinator in Myanmar, in a statement. Nigam asked for the \"immediate and unconditional access to all communities in accordance with humanitarian principles.\" Unrest after reforms The violence has dampened the widely-praised political reforms brought on by President Thein Sein, which included the release of hundreds of political prisoners. Rights groups have said the death toll could far exceed official numbers. \"The way in which the situation has developed is very worrying,\" said Chris Lewa, head of the Arakan Project which campaigns for Rohingya rights. \"It seems that there is a desire to eliminate Rohingyas from all the townships where they are a minority, continuing what occurred in Sittwe.\" The Rohingya have long been considered to be one of the most-persecuted minorities on the planet by the UN. dr/ccp (AFP, Reuters, AP)",

"story": "Suspected terrorists arrested in Germany, Norway Police say three men were arrested in Germany and Norway who are thought to be linked with the terrorist organization al Qaeda. The detainees are reported to have been planning a bomb attack in Oslo. Three suspected al-Qaeda members have been arrested for allegedly preparing a major bomb attack, Norway's Police Security Service (PST) said Thursday. \"Three people suspected ... of preparing a terrorist act and who have links to al-Qaeda have been arrested today,\" Janne Kristiansen, the head of the PST, confirmed reporters in Oslo. National prosecutor Jan Glent told the press conference that the three had been \"charged with having entered into a partnership to commit a terrorist act.\" \"We also think they have links to al-Qaeda and to similar attempts [at terror attacks] in New York and Manchester,\" he added. Kristiansen said that two of the men had been arrested in Oslo and one in Germany after an extensive investigation lasting over a year. The police force would not give details as to the men's suspected plans, but reports say they were preparing a bomb attack in the Norwegian capital using portable bombs similar in design to those used in recently-thwarted attacks in New York City and Manchester, England. Police refused to give the names of the suspects, but Kristiansen said one was a 39-year-old Norwegian citizen of Chinese Uighur origin. Another was a 37-year-old Iraqi Kurd and the third had come to Norway from Uzbekistan as an asylum-seeker. Both foreign nationals, she said, were legal residents of Norway. Kristiansen said the international arrests were the result of cooperation between Norwegian and other European intelligence agencies, although she would not say which. Europe's war on terror Terrorism expert Rolf Tophoven of the Institute for Terrorism Research and Security Policy, told Deutsche Welle that Thursday's arrests were \"evidence\" that Europe's intelligence agencies were on \"highest alert.\" Tophoven likened the fight against terrorism to an Olympic marathon that never ended, with both intelligence forces and terrorists constantly gaining speed. He added that, because of interagency communication, he believed the fight against terrorism was more effective in Europe than in the United States, where intelligence agencies like the FBI and the CIA notoriously compete with each other. Terrorism expert David Schiller agrees. \"There's much more sharing of information and intelligence than there was in the 1980s and 1990s,\" he said. \"[September 11] did bring home the lesson that one nation alone can not stand up against that type of threat, so we have to cooperate and we have to share information.\" Europe needs united policies Norwegian authorities stressed that the threat of terrorism in Norway was normally low and remained low. Schiller believes that to truly fight terrorism, Europe must have stronger, more united policies on its handling of the nations that support terrorists. These arrests, he said, are a \"tactical event\" but \"in the long run, [arresting people alone] is not a strategy.\" Author: David Levitz Editor: Martin Kuebler",

"story": "Facing the challenge of dealing with Tunisia's past Ibtihel Abdellatif has been dealing with the injustices of Tunisia's dictatorial past for years - first for her NGO, and now in the government's Truth and Dignity Commission. But internal squabbles are impeding her work. \"The revolution is our life. We were almost dead inside, but it has returned us to life.\" One of the first things that Ibtihel Abdellatif did following the ousting of longtime Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali on January 14, 2011 was to make her way to the university. There, after more than 10 years away, she completed her masters degree in religious studies. The press, speech and education were once again free after years of dictatorship. There was optimism in the air, many new organizations were established and civil society, long suppressed, was once again flourishing. Along with some fellow activists Abdellatif, 45, founded Nisa' Tounsiat (\"Tunisian Women\"), a non-governmental organization that helps female torture victims. They've since documented more than 200 cases, most of them among the Islamist opposition which was heavily persecuted under Ben Ali. Three years later I meet with Abdellatif in a barren, unused office smelling of stale cigarette smoke. In this disused bank, the Tunisian government set up its Truth and Dignity Committee. Its nine members share five sparsely furnished rooms on the top floor of the building. Abdellatif was chosen as representative of the civil society to take part in the independent commission. Its task: to come to terms with almost 60 years of oppression. From Habib Bourguiba, Tunisia's first president after independence, up to Ben Ali, torture, occupational bans and long prison sentences hit members of the various opposition movements over the years. From freedom to reconciliation \"On January 14, when no one yet knew what had happened and we only had an old piece of bread to eat, this bread was the best I've ever eaten,\" said Abdellatif, describing her feelings after the dictatorship came to an end. \"We were free. Dictatorship, oppression and torture are not allowed to return under any circumstances.\" But the path from freedom to reconciliation is long, and transitional justice remains one of the most controversial topics in Tunisian politics. That has not changed since the commission started its work this past summer. Abdellatif knows that she and her colleagues can easily become the playthings of the various parties. She squirms a bit at the question, rearranging her headscarf and jacket. She only speaks reluctantly about politics since she began her new job. More than any other, the secular Nidaa Tounes party - which brought in the most votes in the October parliamentary elections - is a particular thorn in their side. But the commission is enshrined in the constitution, and works for the Tunisian citizens and not for the politicians, Abdellatif stresses. \"Any attempt to attack us would be an attack on the constitution, which of course was adopted by all the parties,\" she says, adding that this would be a very dangerous move. Fighting for victims' dignity Critics have called the transitional justice system a stillbirth, saying it has come too late and has become too politicized. The Truth and Dignity Commission must overcome many obstacles, not the least among them being internal squabbles. There is no consensus over which victims are entitled to reparations, leading to constant friction between the various camps. From leftist feminists to dissidents in exile and representatives who, like Abdellatif, count themselves as being closer to the Islamists, the commission is quite mixed. Two members have already stepped down, and one had to be replaced. But now work appears to be running smoothly, leaving no room for political disputes. \"On the contrary. We have such a big task ahead of us that there is no time to argue about something that has nothing to do with our actual work,\" she says. Now, what's important is to give victims back their dignity, says Abdellatif. For those who suffered under the dictatorship, financial compensation is much less important than the recognition of their fate. Numerous calls from concerned citizens every day showed that many have high hopes, and Abdellatif remains convinced that the \"commission is a symbol of dignity, for democracy and revolution.\" For Abdellatif, the eldest of five sisters, her work in commission is the logical consequence of her commitment to the rights of victims of the dictatorship. For her, it's also a way to refute a prevailing stereotype of Muslim women. \"I am married and have three sons; I'm surrounded by men,\" she says. \"When I said that I wanted to engage in civil society they supported me. And had that not been the case, I would have done it anyway.\" \"I feel that I'm respected as a woman,\" she says - another small personal victory.",

"story": "France's Fabius delivers doubts over moderate Syria opposition French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has said he is \"pessimistic\" about the strength of the moderate opposition to Syria's government. Fabius voiced skepticism about the likelihood of success at planned peace talks. The French Foreign Minister said that, while France would continue to work towards proposed talks in Geneva in January, hopes that they would provide any kind of resolution were becoming increasingly remote. \"On Syria, I'm unfortunately rather pessimistic,\" Fabius said as he left the World Policy Conference, a meeting of political and business leaders in Monaco. \"The moderate opposition that we support is in serious difficulty,\" he said. Talks have been scheduled for January 22 in the Swiss city - the next stage of extensive diplomatic efforts to bring together warring factions from within Syria's borders. However, Fabius said there were concerns that any progress would be made. \"My fellow European ministers and I are working to make (the talks) a success, but there's room for lots of doubts,\" said Fabius. \"And unfortunately, if this meeting's not a success, it means this martyred country is going to keep suffering - and neighboring countries, too,\" he said. The Syrian government and opposition are to send delegates to the so-called Geneva-2 conference. However, Fabius said that the weakened position of the opposition led him to believe it had lost bargaining powers with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime. \"Bashar al-Assad says he will send representatives to Geneva,\" said Fabius. \"While Mr Assad has a lot of faults, he is not an idiot... we can't see why he would hand over all his powers.\" The more moderate factions of the opposition to al-Assad have faced mounting difficulties this year, increasingly losing ground to Islamist fighters. There was a further blow on Thursday when the US and Britain said they would suspend the provision of non-lethal aid to the Free Syrian Army after an increasingly strong rebel group, the Islamic Front, took over a Turkish border crossing and weapons warehouses nearby. The civil war in Syria has now raged for more than two-and-a-half years and killed more than 126,000 people. rc/lw (AFP, Reuters)",

"story": "India's Spicejet in 'game-changing' deal with Boeing Indian budget airline Spicejet has said it's buying hundreds of Boeing planes as it seeks to hike its share of the world's fastest-growing passenger aviation market. It will be able to expand into long-haul flights. Indian low-cost airline Spicejet announced Friday it was buying up to 205 planes from Boeing in a deal worth $22 billion (20.6 billion euros). The carrier said the contract included 100 737 jets from Boeing's new Max family of aircraft, which it said would help reduce fuel costs by up to a fifth. The deal also included the option to buy 50 wide-body planes suitable for long-haul flights. Spicejet, which currently has just 49 planes, said the order would enable it to boost its domestic operations and potentially expand into long-haul international flights. \"This is the largest deal for Spicejet, it's one of the largest in Indian aviation and is the largest for Boeing in India,\" Spicejet Chairman Ajay Singh said in a statement. Changing environment India's aviation market is growing at double the pace of China's, as an emerging middle class takes to the skies. The latest industry figures from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) show India's domestic air traffic grew by 22.3 percent in November year on year, followed by Russia at 15.5 percent and China in third position at 14.9 percent. The deal with Boeing marks a turnaround for Spicejet, whose planes were briefly grounded in 2014 after suppliers refused to refuel them due to unpaid bills. Most of India's airlines are still making losses, while state carrier Air India has long relied on government support. But lower fuel prices and a rise in economic growth have boosted the sector and enhanced airlines' profit prospects. hg/jd (AFP, dpa)",

"story": "It's a Dog's Life Hmm, a mint biscuit or a garlic cookie? There are some difficult culinary decisions facing pampered pooches in Germany. Dogs in Wiesbaden -- one of Germany's most affluent cities -- have a tough life. First, there is the arduous stroll through the haute couture stores in the luxurious Wilhelmstrasse. Then there is the patient wait while owners take a flutter at the casino or a dip in the thermal springs. But, fortunately, the poor pooches have some compensation -- their very own bakery offering a choice of tuna cookies, love bones, vitality bars and other tasty creations for the affluent, urban dog. A former florist, Janine Saraniti-Lagerin, set up her \"Dog's Goodies\" bakery for canine customers three months ago after being inspired by a television report about similar US shops. In a stylish city where it just wouldn't do to be seen with a chubby canine, the tidbits on sale are, of course, non-fattening and sugar free. They also contain no salt or chemicals that might harm the sensitive little beasts. Pricey treats for pets Although Germans might spend the least in Europe when it comes to putting food on the table, it seems they're willing to make an exception for the chow that lands in their best friend's bowl. Business is booming at the bakery even though the prices for the tasty treats range from 19 to 32 euros pro kilo ($10.90 to $18.60 per pound). Even if not every dog owner frequents the doggy biscuit shop, the bakery is the talk of the town. \"The doggy bakery is what we owners have all been talking about when we walk our dogs,\" said customer Jutta Schneider. Schneider said she brings her male Havanese, Amor, to the shop once a week for his favorite snack, potato balls. And in case Wiesbaden's inhabitants fail to find just the right gift for their cherished pets at the city's famous Christmas markets, the bakery will be offering Christmas stockings filled with doggy cookies during the festive season.",

"story": "Supreme Court blocks Madoff victims from recovering billions A ruling by the US Supreme Court could block victims of Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme from recouping billions of dollars from investors who cashed out before the enterprise of the disgraced financier went bust in 2008. The high court on Monday said federal bankruptcy law did not permit trustee Irving Picard to recover billions of dollars in payments from some clients of Madoff's fraudulent investment scheme who profited from the now defunct company. Those former Madoff customers sold their shares in Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities more than two years before the firm collapsed on Dec. 11, 2008, walking away with handsome profits. Picard, the bankrupt firm's liquidator, subsequently took action to recover the money that Madoff had swindled from unsuspecting investors, many of whom saw their entire life savings evaporate. Picard sought to win back some $4 billion (3.5 billion euros) from people who withdrew more than they invested, but a federal court barred him from doing so late last year. Monday's Supreme Court decision let that ruling stand. 'Clawbacks' According to lawyers in the case, the courts have blocked Picard and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation - a nonprofit that helps customers recover funds when brokerages go under - from directly recoving some $2 billion. It also complicated the process of getting back a further $2 billion. The courts' recalcitrance was due to clauses in federal bankruptcy code that aim to prevent such \"clawbacks.\" When Congress wrote the laws, representatives hoped to preclude the kind of \"significant market disruption\" that recovering lost funds from brokerages could cause. Madoff was exposed a fraud when the financial crisis struck and it became clear that he had perpetrated the world's greatest known financial fraud. The impact of his Ponzi scheme has meanwhile been estimated at $65 billion. cjc/hg (AFP, Reuters)",

"story": "German city of Essen pays addicts in beer to clean streets A project is underway in Essen in which alcoholics are paid in beer to clean up the city's streets. The idea is to help drug addicts pick themselves up and rejoin society. DW went to Essen to see how it's working out. \"I could really use a beer right now, actually...\" This is what J\u00fcrgen*, draped in a reflective orange suit with bulky black boots, said when asked how his day was going, a day he had spent picking up garbage off the streets around Essen's central train station. Pushing a cart armed with picker, broom, and two disposal bins that were full almost to the brim, J\u00fcrgen was visibly proud of the work he had done. \"Not bad, eh?\" He showed me the garbage he had collected as we stood on a broad, quite tidy main square in Essen, the Willy Brandt Platz. Pride and gladness, however, weren't his only emotions. Out of the blue, while discussing his reasons for taking part in the project, J\u00fcrgen's lips started to quiver. \"I just want to do something good. That's all. You wouldn't think it, but this is so hard for me.\" PICK-UP J\u00fcrgen is one of five people in Essen taking part in a project aimed at giving severe alcoholics a chance to rejoin society by cleaning the streets around the city's central train station. It's called PICK-UP, and it and pays participants a small hourly wage - and beer. \"I'm not doing this just for the beer,\u201d J\u00fcrgen said. \"I can find beer on my own. I can get drunk anytime I want. This is something that allows me to help the people around me, and it gives me a chance to give back to my city.\" J\u00fcrgen's workday lasts four hours. The participants change into their suits at 10:30 in the morning at Essen's Addiction Help Center (AHC) and start on their first route that takes them through to lunchtime. After a meal, the participants go out for a second route that is followed by a discussion at the AHC, where they receive their beer - up to three bottles per shift. \"The beer is distributed based on the individual needs of the participants,\" read a fact sheet from Essen's Suchthilfe Direkt, the organization that manages the project. \"Not everyone gets beer. Only the participants who aren't able to do their work without it.\" \"PICK-UP isn't about just cleaning the streets. The project has nothing to do with exploiting people. The idea is to allow participants, who are not forced to take part, to contribute to society in a way they otherwise wouldn't,\" the statement read. 'No chance' The project, which is the only of its kind in Germany, is based on a Dutch model. In Amsterdam's Oost district, a comparable initiative has been in place since last year, and according to organizers, it has been a success with regard to reducing the amount of alcohol participants drink on a daily basis. \"There's no way this gig is going to reduce how much an alcoholic drinks,\" said Simone*, who was hanging out at the station while J\u00fcrgen and two other participants passed by on their afternoon route. Simone said she'd been here in Essen for the past 18 years, a period in which the \"drinking and drug scene\" around the main station has steadily grown. \"People that hang out here are addicts, but it's not only alcohol. Many of us are junkies. Heroin, cocaine, crystal [methamphetamine], you name it, you'll find people here that use it,\" Simone said, adding that alcohol abuse among drug users at the Essen station was a kind of common denominator. She doesn't, however, approve of the new project. \"I don't have a job because I don't want one, and I doubt that anybody would want to hire me in my current state. But am I going to take part in a charity scheme that pays me one euro [an hour] to make a fool of myself? I can get more money begging in 10 minutes. And, quite honestly, a beer costs 25 cents here. Am I going to sweep the streets for three beers? No chance.\" 'Scaring people away' Simone surmised that the motivation for the project was more of a political than an altruistic nature. \"It's no secret that the politicians don't want us here. Time and again the authorities force us to leave, even though we aren't doing anything wrong. It is not against the law to drink in public in Germany. We aren't in the United States yet, where you can get arrested for smoking cigarettes on the street,\" Simone said, smirking. Not all politicians, however, are in favor of the controversial project, which made news headlines around the world when launched last Wednesday. \"I can well imagine that this project would work fine even if alcohol weren't the main incentive,\" said Karlheinz Endruschat, social affairs spokesman of Essen's Social Democrats. \"The image of a bum and his bottle is not a stereotype we necessarily have to perpetuate to the people of our city.\" Among passers by at the Essen station, meanwhile, the perpetual display of public drinking isn't exactly welcome. When asked whether it was irritating, the most common answer was \"yes,\" and the most common complaint concerned public urination. \"It stinks outside the station all the time, when the smell wafts in from over there,\" an elderly woman said, referring to a set of steps located some 50 meters from where the group congregates (see picture). \"Yeah, the guys go down there,\" Simone said, unbothered. \"Dogs go pee-pee on the streets too, but I don't see anybody concerned about that. This is the problem with projects like [PICK-UP]; they assume we want to rejoin society so badly, that we are so utterly lost with our lot in life. The truth is: We have been severed from society, and that is just fine that way.\" 'Damn wrong' Later on in the day at the Willy Brandt Platz, J\u00fcrgen could be seen hanging around with Simone and around 15 other people at the station, this time dressed in jeans and a brown leather jacket. He was finished with his day's work. Beer in hand, and ostensibly unwilling to answer any more questions, he said: \"You people think this is easy, don't you? That we just drink all day and watch the day go by. Well you know what, you're damn wrong, and I'm happy I'm doing what I'm doing.\" He also wasn't in the least perturbed that Simone and the rest of the gang were against the PICK-UP project. \"What should it matter to me what they think? I know I'm doing a good thing by picking up the streets. I'm going to drink either way. At least now I've got something to be proud of when my day is through.\" *J\u00fcrgen and Simone requested that DW withhold their actual names.",

"story": "Girls as Goods - Forced Prostitution in Berlin They offer her bodies for sale. Many of them don\u2019t have passports and don\u2019t speak German. In particular, young girls from Eastern Europe are increasingly falling prey to unscrupulous traffickers. Young girls from Romania and Bulgaria, some of them underage, are forced to have sex with up to 15 men a day, often without protection. Forced prostitution is a business that earns pimps and unscrupulous businessmen millions every year at the expense of enslaved girls and women who\u2019re often desperately looking for a way out. Girls are Snared by Internet Advertisements Often the young women see their way to Germany as the only way to secure a better life for themselves and their families. They live in a country where prostitution is actually prohibited. And yet there is in all major cities of illegal brothels and women who offer their bodies on the street. In this climate, and the trade is thriving. Girls growing up in poverty can be easy game for traffickers. Our film also shows how ruthless Berlin brothel owners lure young Romanian women into prostitution in Germany with ads on the Internet \u2013 and quite legally, since the German parliament\u2019s 2002 Law on Prostitution equates the operation of brothels with other more conventional services. Since then, the market has demanded an increasing supply of new girls - also because this uninhibited approach to prostitution now attracts sex tourists from all over Europe. A Brutal Cycle of Violence and Sex Authors Nadya Luer and Jo Goll spent over a year making contact with victims of forced prostitution. In long and confidential discussions, some of these women open up to the reporters and explain how they were lured by brutal traffickers back home \u2013 with the prospect of work as a waitress or nurse for the elderly in prosperous Germany.

"story": "Creators Praise Popularity of Berlin Holocaust Monument As the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin nears its first anniversary, initiators looked back at a year of controversy -- and success. The Memorial to the Murdered Jews in Europe in Berlin was visited by 3.5 million people in its first year, organizers said, but nonetheless it remains controversial. Even today, the response to the site is divided, acknowledged Lea Rosh, the activist who fought for years to establish a German memorial to European Jews killed by the Nazis. Looking back at the year, Salomon Korn, a member of the memorial's board of trustees, admitted the memorial was not to everyone's liking. But, he said, the number of visitors attested to the monument's power. The memorial, not far from the Brandenburg Gate, consists of an open space covered with 2,700 gray cement columns of different heights, and an underground Information Center. Uwe Neum\u00e4rker, who heads up the foundation that created the memorial -- officially the Foundation for the Memorial to the Murdered Jews -- acknowledges that the 3.5 million visitor number is just an estimate. Still, the underground information center had 490,000 registered visitors, making the site a \"tourism magnet,\" he said. Respectful treatment Despite fears of vandalism, the monument has been treated with respect, Neum\u00e4rker said. And in the underground documentation center, which contains historical information on the genocide perpetrated by the Nazis, the people are \"well behaved and quiet, without us having to tell them,\" he added. The monument was designed by US architect Peter Eisenman, at a total cost of 27 million euros ($35 million). It opened with a ceremony on May 10, 2005, in the presence of 1,200 guests. Two days later, it was opened to the public. This year, on May 13 a \"long night of memorial,\" with readings, discussions and theater performances, is planned. The association's Korn, speaking on Germany's national Deutschlandradio, said the strength of the field of pillars is that it doesn't have a single given message, but rather is open to interpretation from everyone. And criticism of the plan -- for instance, that it is unfair to have a monument only to murdered Jews and not to other groups that were persecuted by the Nazis, like the Sinti-Roma or homosexuals -- has died down somewhat, acknowledged initiator Rosh. \"It is wonderful for us to see so many people going there,\" she said. And, she noted, visitors did not seem to have an attitude that the Holocaust was something no longer important and best left in the past. Little vandalism Up to now, there have been five cases of swastikas being painted on the memorial's pillars, and one star of David. Neum\u00e4rker discounted the vandalism, calling it \"basically, nothing.\" During the creation of the monument, Rosh set off an outcry when she said she planned to bury the tooth of a Holocaust victim under one of the columns. There was also a discussion over appropriate monument behavior, given the penchant of certain younger visitors to hop from pillar to pillar. A sausage stand at the monument's edge (it is accessible from all sides, and open around the clock, seven days a week) also came under heavy fire. Now, a private builder has set up a disputed pavilion that houses a caf\u00e9, bookstore and snack stand. \"There is always debate over this monument. And that's a good thing. As long as people are talking about it, it will stay alive,\" Neum\u00e4rker said.",

"story": "Saudi effort to squash criticism of Yemen war violations may backfire Saudi Arabia and its allies have threatened the UN with cutting funds to millions of children in order to squash criticism of rights violations in Yemen. Blackmailing the UN is unlikely to avert criticism. Saudi Arabia is throwing its financial and diplomatic weight around in an effort to mask inconvenient but widely documented human rights abuses and violations of international law tied to its war in Yemen. The kingdom's most recent endeavor was revealed in a rare public rebuke from UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who said on Thursday he faced \"undue pressure\" to remove the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen from a blacklist of countries that kill and maim children. The secretary general said he had made the \"painful and difficult\" decision to temporarily remove the Saudi-led coalition from the annex of the report earlier this week due to the \"very real prospect\" that millions of children in Palestine, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen would be cut off from funding. The Saudis and allied Gulf states provide hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to UN bodies annually, including the UN children's fund. The UN report on children and armed conflict, dubbed a \"list of shame,\" found the US-supported, Saudi-led coalition was responsible for 60 percent of the 1,953 children killed or injured in Yemen in 2015. The UN documented 101 attacks on schools and hospitals, for which the coalition was held responsible for about half. Other armed groups in the conflict, including Houthi rebels, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), the \"Islamic State,\" Yemeni government forces and militia were also listed in the annex. Saudi Arabia and its allies, as well as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council all applied pressure to squash the report. Particularly contentious was the placement of the coalition together with terrorist and extremist groups. The UN report parallels widespread findings by rights groups accusing the Saudi-led coalition of committing grave violations of international law in its prosecution of the war in Yemen. The coalition, which includes the Gulf oil states and is backed by the United States, denies any wrongdoing. Saudi Arabia's UN Ambassador Abdallah Al-Mouallimi denied using \"threats or intimidation\" against the UN, while opining that it was his view that the delisting was \"final, irreversible and unconditional.\" Ban said the coalition listing will now go to a joint review of cases. The UN's decision triggered a torrent of criticism from human rights groups, which noted removing the Saudi-led coalition sends \"a message to parties to armed conflict that if they apply sufficient political pressure, they can manipulate their exclusion from the list and avoid scrutiny and accountability.\" \"If the Saudi-led Coalition wants to be removed from the list, it should stop killing and maiming children and bombing schools and hospitals in Yemen\u2014the violations for which it was listed,\" Human Rights Watch and 19 other groups wrote in an open letter to the secretary general. The Saudi efforts to squash criticism may even cause rights organizations to double down on their already harsh criticism of the kingdom's conduct in Yemen. Jane Kinninmont, the deputy head of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, told DW that Saudi strong-arm tactics may further damage its reputation. But, citing the US and Israel, she noted the Saudis threatened to cut funding just as a small number of other powerful countries have done. \"It has not helped its international reputation in this case, but the move may be aimed more at the domestic audience, and also takes place in the context of possible legal challenges to the conduct of the war in Yemen,\" she said. \"It is part of a general PR effort to discredit all reports of violations of international humanitarian law as Houthi propaganda.\" The UN excluded Israel and Hamas from the list last year after coming under pressure from Washington and Tel Aviv, which argued Israel should not be on the same list as a terrorist organization. \"Now we have a pattern where you can bully your way off the list,\" Veronica Yates, the director of Child Rights International Network, which signed onto the open letter to Ban, told DW. \"It really undermines a mechanism that has taken years to build up and strengthen.\" Since coming to the throne in early 2015, King Salman bin-Abdulaziz al-Saud and his 30-year-old son, the deputy crown prince and defense minister Mohammed bin Salman, have pursed a more aggressive foreign policy. The kingdom and its allies entered into a war of choice in Yemen against an alliance of Houthi rebels and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh in a bid reinstall the government of President Abed-Rabbo Mansour Hadi and counter alleged Iranian influence in its backyard. The military operations and a naval blockade have exacerbated the humanitarian situation to the point that 80 percent of Yemenis are in need of assistance. Yet, the Saudis and Gulf states are also major contributors to UN operations, including in Yemen. This gives them considerable leverage and cover to pursue geopolitical objectives. Sebastian Sons, an associate fellow at the Near East and North Africa Program at the German Council on Foreign Relations, told DW that the UN backtracking reflects the increased influence of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states on the UN. \"Saudi Arabia was one of the most important donors to UN institutions. The Saudi influence on the UN has increased tremendously,\" said Sons. \"Nonetheless, this UN decision is a wrong step aiming at appeasing Saudi Arabia and to continue the cooperation with Saudi Arabia.\" He cautioned, however, that the Saudis need to act more cautiously and diplomatically in the future. \"Otherwise, the international criticism against the Saudi policy will further increase which cannot be in the interest of the Saudi government,\" he said, noting the country faces severe security, socio-economic and external problems.",

"story": "Headaches Loom as EU Returns to Work The European Union will be well advised to make the most of its summer break. Hard decisions and difficult times lay ahead not only for the member states that are on leave but also for the institutions in Brussels. The EU quarter in the center of the Belgian capital, normally the beating heart of the European Union, slows to a more sedate pace in July and August as the six-week summer vacation begins. But once the holiday has passed, it's back to the desk again for EU commissioners and representatives of the European Parliament. The summer break is coming to an end and the EU will soon be back in EU policy business. But what issues are waiting for the thousands of returning officials? Summer is a deceptive time in Brussels. Europe's pulse might be slower but the issues that can quicken the beat and raise the blood pressure are still there waiting for those who left them in the in-tray back in July: the finances of the bloc; the constitution crisis, the accession negotiations with Turkey and Croatia, the nuclear quarrel with Iran and the on-going fight against terrorism. EU foreign ministers are holding their first meeting after the holiday this Thursday and Friday. The informal gathering takes place this year in the British city of Newport. Turkey on everyone's mind The British EU presidency has much to consider in the first half of its one-year tenure, most pressingly the negotiation framework of Turkey's EU accession bid. What was once perceived as a difficult but not impossible issue has now become a controversial one. Cyprus, Greece and France are demanding unequivocal recognition of Cyprus by Turkey before accession talks can begin. Austria and a Germany under the possible leadership of a conservative chancellor -- Angela Merkel -- are pushing for \"privileged partnership\" status only and not full membership as the accession negotiations imply. The British themselves are in favor of beginning negotiations with Turkey on Oct. 3, as was decided in December last year. Iran negotiations enter critical stage Moving further into the Middle East, Europe will be thrust once more into the potential powder keg of negotiations with wannabe nuclear power Iran. Whether the Islamic Republic wants nuclear power or the bomb is still a point of contention but Europe will first have to continue its negotiations regarding the suspension of uranium enrichment before that more delicate subject is broached. The Iranians themselves have renounced the deals offered by the EU and have restarted reactors. The diplomatic initiative -- led by Britain, France and Germany and resulting in one agreement more than a year ago -- is now threatened with failure. Blair may put terror first Away from the international arena further afield, issues closer to home will need to be addressed. The biggest hot potato is the EU constitution. British Prime Minister Tony Blair will host a summit at the end of October to press his own social model as a blueprint for the EU constitution. But even that may take a back seat to the more pressing issue for the British at this time -- international terrorism. Then there is the continuing to and fro concerning Chinese textile import quotas, which have been generating angry reactions throughout Europe of late. Retailers want their low-cost brassieres and trousers while others want their industry protected. EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson is running out of time to find a solution which everyone involved is happy with.

"story": "Sydney terror suspects plans revealed The Australian government has released details about the two terror suspects it arrested earlier in the week. The men threatened stabbings and claimed to be operating on behalf of \"Islamic State.\" The two suspected terrorists arrested in Australia on Tuesday were identified on Thursday as Omar Al-Kutobi, 24, and Mohammad Kiad, 25. Besides the knife, machete, and homemade \"Islamic State\" flag seized at their Sydney home, the Australian government also released details of a video in which one of the men threatens to stab the kidney and necks of Australians. After watching the video, Prime Minister Tony Abbott told parliament it depicted a man kneeling before the black flag with a knife saying \"I swear to almighty Allah, we will carry out the first operation for the soldiers of the caliphate in Australia\u2026 I swear to you almighty Allah, blond people, there is no room for blame between you and us. We only owe you stabbing the kidneys and striking necks.\" Sydney police said they responded to a tipoff that Kutobi and Kiad were planning to carry out violence on Tuesday when the pair was arrested and charged with intent to launch a terrorist attack. Neither has asked for bail or entered a plea to the charges, which carry a possible life prison sentence. Immigration Minister Peter Dutton responded to reports on Thursday that the men came to Australia as refugees, and perhaps with fake passports. Dutton admitted that one of them may have entered the country with \"some false documentation\" and called for an urgent review of the matter. \"Monstrous extremism\" \"I don't think it would be possible to witness uglier fanaticism than this, monstrous extremism than this, and I regret to say it is now present in our country,\" Prime Minister Abbott said. Whether the two men actually have ties to the IS terrorist group is under investigation. The government believes that at least 70 Australians are fighting with IS in Syria and Iraq, helped by around 100 Australia-based facilitators. In December, Man Monis, an Iran-born self-styled cleric with a criminal record, took 18 people hostage in a downtown Sydney caf\u00e9. Among his demands that he be delivered an \"Islamic State\" flag, though investigators later established he hadn't had any contact with the jihadist group. Last year, Abbott committed Australian aircraft and special forces to assist in the fight against IS in Iraq, introduced tough new laws on foreign militants returning to Australia, and gave security forces enhanced powers. es/jil (AP, Reuters)",

"story": "Drone usage on the rise in conflicts worldwide Drones are becoming more widespread throughout the world - be it in Pakistan, Iraq, in Yemen or Somalia. These unmanned planes, currently mainly piloted remotely, may eventually engage each other on their own. On Thursday, Iranian and Indian media reported that an American drone strike had killed four militants in the North Waziristan region of Pakistan. Over in Europe, also on Thursday, the French Ministry of Defense said it was in talks with a military contractor to order a new fleet of drones that could be deployed as soon as 2014. Meanwhile, across the globe, on the very same day, the police chief in the Australian capital, Canberra, told Australian media that he was considering deploying surveillance drones across his city's skies. Over the last few years, drones have become an indispensible part of the American campaign to combat terrorism in various parts of the world, and also are starting to trickle into law enforcement tactics worldwide as well. Major increase in drone attacks The United States has especially increased its use of drones in Pakistan. Between 2004 and 2007 there were just nine drone attacks. In 2008 it was 33, the next year it was 53 and last year the attacks hit 118. The estimates about the number of fatalities from these attacks range from 600 to almost 1,000. \"I can't imagine that the USA would launch this many manned air attacks in Pakistan,\" said J\u00fcrgen Altmann, in an interview with Deutsche Welle. The University of Dortmund physicist is a founding member of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control (ICRAC), a non-profit organization that advocates for a re-evaluation of automated war technologies, like drones. The fact that these planes are relatively small and have no crew on board makes it easier for Pakistan's government to allow them, Altmann said. \"[The] threshold for the involvement of unmanned drones in conflict is lower, as when manned planes are involved,\" he said. War without risk? The enormous increase in computer power, new camera and sensor technology has made it possible to run a war without risk to one's soldiers. Noel Sharkey, a professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom, said the new development isn't just dangerous for civilians living in enemy territory. \"It is also dangerous for our own civilians, because lopsided wars lead to new terrorism,\" he noted. \"People won't just give up because we've got the best technology.\" The case for drones? A worldwide drones arms race is well and truly underway. Some 50 states have already bought drones for surveillance \u2013 including countries like Israel, Germany, China, Russia and Iran. Many of these nations are working on armed drones as well. Drone proponents argue that the money saved in comparison to normal fighter jets is considerable: a US MQ 9 drone costs only $10 million (7.05 million euros) and can be loaded up with 14 Hellfire rockets. By comparison, a F-22 fighter jet costs around $150 million (105.8 million euros). Plus, the training for the drone pilots also costs much less than training for a traditional jet pilot. Plus, others have argued that a drone's inability to become emotionally inflamed might be a possible argument for the increased use of drones. \"Robots don't get angry when their fellow soldiers get killed,\" said Peter Warren Singer, an analyst at the American think-tank, the Brookings Institution, and the author of the 2009 book, \"Wired for War.\" \"They don't commit any crime due out of revenge or retaliation \u2013 that's one of the reasons why war crimes are committed,\" he told Deutsche Welle. \"But for a robot an 80-year-old grandmother is the same as a tank. Both are just a combination of zeros and ones.\" An ethical robot Similarly, Ronald Arkin, a professor of robotics at the Georgia Institute of Technology, believes that robots' unemotional operating methods as a strength. Arkin is convinced that systems can be developed which will be better than humans on the battle field - he argues that it may be possible to program a robot with the rules of the Geneva Conventions. This would mean they could refuse to carry out some orders which contradict the rules of international conflict and rules of engagement. However, not all roboticists are convinced of the ability to reduce human ethics into software. \"Because no-one knows what it means to bring in ethical considerations into programming,\" said Hans-J\u00f6rg Kreowsky, a professor of computer science at the University of Bremen. \"Ethics can't be defined by algorithms, that means you can't build it.\" Author: Matthias von Hein / al Editor: Cyrus Farivar",

"story": "Cleveland Indians baseball team to drop 'offensive' logo After years of complaints, a cartoon image depicting a Native American known as Chief Wahoo is to be replaced. The mascot has been labeled racist but fans say it is iconic. The grinning, red-faced caricature of a Native American chief is to be dropped from the uniforms of the Cleveland Indians from next year, the US baseball team confirmed on Monday. The cartoonish image of a big-toothed American Indian, \"Chief Wahoo\u201d complete with single feather in his headdress, has long been criticized as racist by Native American organizations. Discussions have taken place over the past year between community groups, the club, and Major League Baseball \u2014 the sport's US governing body to remove the logo, despite resistance from fans. Indians owner explains \"We have consistently maintained that we are cognizant and sensitive to both sides of the discussion,\" said Cleveland Indians owner Paul Dolan. \"While we recognize many of our fans have a longstanding attachment to Chief Wahoo, I'm ultimately in agreement with (MLB) Commissioner Manfred's desire to remove the logo from our uniforms in 2019.\" Read more: US President Donald Trump claims he's 'not a racist' after controversial remark The change will take place in time for the 2019 season and will lead to the logo being removed from the team's jersey sleeves and caps. The Chief Wahoo logo has been used in one form or another since 1947, but has been slowly phased out over the past few years in favor of the letter \"C.\" The Indians are the latest sports team to change their logo or name following criticism from Native American groups, following in the footsteps of several US colleges. But one high-profile National Football League (NFL) team, the Washington Redskins, have repeatedly ignored calls to do so. 'Respect' a long time coming The change was welcomed by Native American groups including Oneida Indian Nation, who had campaigned for many years for the logo to be retired. \"The Cleveland baseball team has rightly recognized that Native Americans do not deserve to be denigrated as cartoon mascots, and the team's move is a reflection of a grassroots movement that has pressed sports franchises to respect Native people,\" Oneida Nation representative Ray Halbritter said in a statement. \"I'm elated,\" Philip Yenyo, executive director of the American Indian Movement of Ohio, said of the decision. \"But at the same time, I think it should be this year. I don't understand why they're drawing this out. It doesn't make any sense to me, unless they want to continue to make what's basically blood money,\" referring to the club's merchandising revenue. Yenyo and others have demanded that the team go further and drop \"Indians\" from its name. Read more: Donald Trump revives 'Pocahontas' jab during event honoring Native Americans Fans at a loss But some Indians' fans hit out at the move, with one declaring on Twitter that the chief had been created out of honor, not racism. \"It's a big disappointment,\" said Indians' supporter Jeremiah Baker, who was interviewed at a sporting goods store in a suburb of Cleveland. \"Chief Wahoo has been so iconic for so many years, and I understand that some people may be offended, but it's a blow to native Clevelanders.\" Another fan, Marko Farion, said: \"This PC thing has gone too far,\" using an abbreviation for political correctness. Within a few minutes of the announcement, the hashtag #SavetheChief began to circulate on social media. mm/aw (AFP, AP, Reuters)",

"story": "IMF warns global recovery 'too slow, too fragile' International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Christine Lagarde has ramped up her calls for stronger policies by the world's economies to boost growth, warning that downside risks would only increase without decisive action. In a speech at the Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany, on Tuesday, Christine Lagarde outlined specific policy actions to spur global growth, warning that the recovery from the 2008-2009 financial crisis \"remains too slow, too fragile.\" \"Let me be clear: We are on alert, not alarm. There has been a loss of growth momentum,\" Lagarde said, adding that if policymakers across the world would act together to confront the challenges, \"the positive effects on global confidence will be substantial.\" The IMF chief urged the United States to raise its minimum wage, expand tax credits for the working poor and improve family leave benefits. She also called on European countries to implement better training and employment-matching policies to help reduce unemployment among young people. Moreover, emerging economies should cut fuel subsidies and boost social spending, she demanded, while countries with high and growing debts and elevated borrowing costs should pursue further fiscal consolidation. Risks mounting Her remarks come less than two weeks before senior ministers, central bankers and other policymakers from the IMF's 188 member countries gather in Washington for the IMF and World Bank spring meetings to assess the health of the world economy. The global emergency lender has already indicated it will cut its current 2016 global growth forecast of 3.4 percent next week when it publishes fresh forecasts at the meeting in Washington. During her speech in Frankfurt, Largarde said weak global growth was \"exacerbated\" by China's relative economic slowdown, lower commodity prices and the prospect of financial tightening for many countries. \"Emerging markets had largely driven the recovery and the expectation was that the advanced economies would pick up the 'growth baton.' This has not happened,\" she said, adding that other risks, such as uncertainties from terrorist attacks or \"the silent threat of global epidemics\" were also a factor. Lagarde also warned against resorting to protectionist policies, as the US presidential candidates publicly questioned free trade agreements and Europe sought to rein in free movement in response to the refugee crisis. \"To some, the answer is to look inward ... to close borders and to retreat into protectionism,\" she observed. \"But history has told us - time and again - this would be a tragic course.\" Greek debt crisis re-emerges In her remarks, Lagarde did not mention negotiations between the IMF, European lenders and Greece for a new bailout program for the heavily indebted eurozone country. After the whistleblowing Web site Wikileaks published an apparent transcript of a controversial IMF conference call over the weekend, Lagarde denied on Monday that IMF staff might threaten to pull out of the Greek bailout as a negotiating tactic to force more European debt relief for Greece.

"story": "Whose side are we on? The financial crisis and Greeks in Germany Greek expats living in Germany are in a strange quandary. It is tough to take sides, when they are torn between a desire to speak for the Greek people and yet vouch for the country where they lead relatively easy lives. \"Can you have any opinion at all about this crisis,\" yells Theo (name changed), as he shoves journalists out of his tiny Greek restaurant in Bonn. He refused to say a word about Athens, shutting his eyes and closing his ears every time he hears the word \"Tsipras.\" Athens has defaulted a debt repayment of 1.5 billion euros to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and is speeding towards bankruptcy. The eurozone's leaders' willingness to compromise is rapidly shrinking and a referendum this Sunday will decide whether the Greeks support Prime Minister Tsipras' proposals or whether they side with the European Union. Against this volatile backdrop, finding out what Greeks, who live in Germany's former capital, think about their country's problems, can be a tough call. A journalist has to, paparazzo-like, sneakily ask questions about the weather or order several rounds of drinks before a kind waiter at a Greek restaurant finally relents and speaks on the dreaded subject. \"You can tell the whole world that my staff and I support the European Union and what the European Central Bank has proposed to Greece,\" says Alex, the owner of a popular restaurant by the Rhine in Bonn. He hopes the referendum on Sunday will be for the European Union's proposal and that Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will have to step down. You need \"Vitamin B\" in Greece Nikos, who sells gyros and pita at a Bonn suburb, is of Greek origin, but the 26-year-old considers himself more German than Greek. \"Greeks are lazy,\" he laments, adding that only connections to important people help you get your job done. \"Vitamin B is the only thing that works,\" he claims, referring to connections - \"Beziehungen\" in German, using a popular metaphor. But Nikos is aware of the problems that have been bothering his extended family back in Thessaloniki. He has been saving up to send money to his cousins, many of who don't have enough money to buy food. \"Many children come to school without having had anything to eat at home,\" says Sokratis Ntallis, archpriest at the Orthodox Greek Church in Bonn. \"The church makes food and clothes available to such people,\" he adds. The Orthodox Church in Germany works together with its Greek counterpart to help those in need. These include Greece's younger generation, many of whom have been driven to suicide after they couldn't handle the financial turmoil. Why it's tough to take sides Compared to life in Greece, Elena Aliki Papyrou has it easy in Germany. The professional translator from Athens has been living in Bonn for almost ten years now. News from home has been depressing lately. \"Many of my friends have moved out of the country to find jobs and a better future. They are affected not only financially. The quality of life has also suffered. They work a lot for less money,\" she adds. For Elena, Greece's people have themselves been largely responsible for the crisis today. \"Corruption has been rampant in the last 50 years and it simply got transferred from one government to another,\" Elena explains, adding that Greeks didn't even think what they were voting for. \"The people of my country will have to use their minds,\" she hopes. But speaking their mind is not what many Greeks in Bonn want to do right now. Some feel that their opinions may not be representative of all the Greeks living in the city. For many, like Alex, speaking his mind may mean bad business. \"The last time the markets crashed, in 2008, we spoke to many journalists from different channels. After a week, we lost over 10 percent of our clientele,\" he says. The food business has its ups and downs, but since the beginning of this year, several customers have simply stopped coming, he adds. Like Alex, most Greeks here in Bonn feel that having an opinion on Greece's finances is a difficult task. Greeks on Sunday will have to decide carefully, what is best for them. A Grexit is unthinkable for these expats, for Europe cannot exist without Greece. \"Europa is a Greek word,\" Alex sums up his emotions in one sentence.",

"story": "The \"Californication\" of European Cities Marathons, Love Parades, World Youth Day, Christopher St. Day, World Cup, Carnival of Cultures: The European city has become a stage for fleeting productions. But does all that partying have consequences? Marathons: These days there are over 200 every year in Germany alone. There is hardly a day without \"Detour\" signs on the roads because the people of small, medium or large cities have taken over the streets to celebrate something. Christopher Street Day, Love Parade, Carnival of Cultures, not to mention the Pope's visit and the most recent World Cup festivities -- the European city has become a stage for a continually rotating series of parties and festivals. The production of events that permeate the entire city for just a few days is a phenomenon that's been given a name: The \"Californication\" of European cities. Urban bodies In his book \"Urban Bodies -- A Breakdown of the Problem\" (2002), Claus Dreyer, a professor of architecture in Detmold, explains the relationship between the human body and the architecture in a city. According to Dreyer, the \"rhythm of life\" during a given epoque can be interpreted both in the movements and gestures of the people and in the arrangement of elements in the cities. Charles Baudelaire's immortalized bourgeois pedestrian, who walked along slowly and carelessly, was dubbed an urban prototype by German philosopher Walter Benjamin at the beginning of the 20th century. The passageways and boulevards of Belle Epoque Paris correspond to him, Dreyer said. Botho Strauss's pedestrian in \"Paare, Passanten\" (1981) replaced Baudelaire's around the turn of the millennium. \"Disoriented and apathetic, he crosses through foyers, underpasses and shopping centers that all look the same and don't allow for boredom or communication,\" wrote the architecture professor. \"Californication\" in Europe Increasingly, disinterest in the urban unit is juxtaposed with a new \"body cult\" in cities, which manifests itself in events like the Love Parade, Christopher Street Day or Carnival of Cultures. These \"body cult\" events lead to a loss of reality in the city by dressing it up for the temporary festivals, Deyer wrote. The phrase 'Californication' -- an intentionally vulgar compound of \"California\" and \"fornication\" -- was first used in the 1970s and 1980s by Oregon residents to spurn the massive influx of Californians moving across the northern border of their state. As far as Europe is concerned, \"Californication\" is used in the context of mass sport events (city marathons, for example), numerous festivals, performances, and shows that enliven the urban body, Dreyer found. But the term's allusions to sexuality and imposition are hardly lost. It could be, he added, that the \"Californication\" of the European city is a final protest against ever-increasing digitalization and virtualization, which is, in a sense, stealthily dismembering the city. The film \"The Matrix\" is a portrayal of such urban disintegration. Renewed religiosity and patriotism? Observations like Deyer's may be useful in answering the questions specialists and journalists pose every time a religious, sporting or other kind of event draws hundreds of thousands of Europeans onto the streets of their city. When the Pope visited Germany in 2005, many spoke of a new religiosity among the people. Recently, the World Cup sparked talk of renewed patriotism. It seems as if the people who called \"Benedict, Benedict!\" last year are the same ones who hoisted their flags and shouted \"Deutschland, Deutschland!\" last week. Dreyer is not the only one who fears that the festival -- the incarnate metaphor of public life -- could become the doom of the very thing it represents. The rock group Red Hot Chili Peppers criticized urban superficiality and the decline of Western civilization in their 1999 song \"Californication.\" And Berlin philosopher Dietmar Kamper (1936 - 2001) agreed with Deyer already in 1976 when he wrote: \"As soon as society renews its demand for 'games', it will become unreal and abstract and will accelerate its own self-destruction.\"",

The opening ceremony was quite the spectacle, complete with dancers rappeling down the side of the building. Luxury Swiss watch manufacturer Hublot announced its arrival in New York on Tuesday in one of the most dazzling ways imaginable. Following a ribbon-cutting ceremony celebrating the opening of its flagship store on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, spectators were treated to a remarkable spectacle. Two dancers, suspended by wires, rappelled down the side of a glass building in a bout of gravity-defying acrobatics. A store tailored for the best Founded in 1980 by Italian Carlo Crocco, the Swiss company is known for its sleek, expensive watches for men. Describing his design for the boutique shop on Fifth Avenue, architect Peter Marino said he modeled the storefront after the devices themselves. \"The sculptural movement inherent in the facade is an abstract notion of time and the perpetual mechanism of the watch,\" Marino said, according to the Hublot website.\" The manufacturer is currently gearing up for the release of a signature watch in honor of Olympic sprinter Usain Bolt.",

"story": "IMF's Lagarde should face court in Tapie affair - prosecutor A French prosecutor says IMF chief Christine Lagarde should face trial over a massive state payout to tycoon Bernard Tapie. The Supreme Court is now due to rule on the recommendation on July 22. The prosecutor recommended Friday that Lagarde's appeal against charges of misuse of public funds be rejected. Lagarde, who is head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), appealed an earlier Court of Justice ruling in December that she should face trial over a case where prominent French businessman Bernard Tapie received 404 million euros ($450 million) in taxpayer funds while she was French finance minister. The case dates back to 1993, when Tapie sold his majority stake in the sports giant Adidas to become a French cabinet minister. He later sued the French bank Credit Lyonnais, which bought the stake, accusing the lender of undervaluing the company. More than a decade later, Tapie backed Nicolas Sarkozy for president. In 2008, once elected, Sarkozy's government intervened in the court case when Lagarde ordered that the dispute transfer to binding arbitration. Judges later ruled that Tapie should receive hundreds of millions of euros in compensation. France's Supreme Court is expected to rule on Friday's recommendation on July 22. If the original order is upheld, the 60-year-old Lagarde will be tried in the Law Court of the Republic, which handles cases concerning offences committed by sitting government ministers. Prosecutors say Lagarde failed to challenge the arbitration ruling at the time, which they say was prejudicial to the state. She could face a year in jail if convicted as well as a fine of 15,000 euros. Lagarde has denied any wrongdoing or that she acted on orders from Sarkozy. Separately, Tapie was eventually charged with fraud, before being ordered to repay the cash in February 2015. He lost an appeal against the ruling on Thursday. Despite the case hanging over her, IMF's Lagarde to run for second term the IMF has named Lagarde to a second term as managing director, which officially starts next week. mm/kl (AFP, Reuters)",

"story": "Prosecutor requests Sarkozy stand trial over 2012 campaign funds The Paris state prosecutor has recommended former French President Nicolas Sarkozy face trial over alleged illegal funding of his failed 2012 campaign. The case could ruin his chances of running for president in 2017. The Paris prosecutor's office said Monday it had asked investigating magistrates to send former French President Nicolas Sarkozy and 13 others to court. The judges in charge of the case must now decide whether to follow the prosecution's recommendations. Sarkozy is accused of false accounting that allowed him to significantly exceed campaign spending limits in 2012. He was handed preliminary charges over the scandal and put under investigation in February. Re-election bid Sarkozy served as president of France between 2007 and 2012, before losing his re-election bid to current Socialist President Francois Hollande. The 61-year-old has announced plans to run for the presidency again in next year's elections, but a criminal trial could hurt his chances of success. To get a spot on the 2017 ballot, Sarkozy will first have to win backing from his conservative party in primaries set for November. His main rival for the nomination of Les Republicains (The Republicans) is Alain Juppe, 71, who has served as prime minister and minister of defense plus foreign minister. Allegations of illegal overspending The illegal funding case hinges on the activity of public relations firm Bygmalion, which organized some of Sarkozy's campaign appearances and is accused of using an invoice system to conceal unauthorized overspending. Bygmalion allegedly charged 18.5 million euros ($21 million) to Sarkozy's right-wing party - then called the UMP, but since renamed Les Republicains - instead of billing the campaign. According to the prosecution, the incorrect invoicing allowed it to greatly exceed the legal spending limit of 22.5 million euros. nm/jil (Reuters, AFP)",

Reverend Paul Knight hailed her as a \"21st century Good Samaritan.\" Slain British lawmaker Jo Cox was remembered in a memorial service on Sunday in the town of Birstall, where she was killed going into a meeting with constituents. Cox, a Labour MP, was shot on Thursday by a man who yelled xenophobic slogans as he committed the crime. \"Her humanity was powerful and compelling and we would do well to recognize her as an amazing example - a 21st century Good Samaritan,\" said Reverend Paul Knight, who led the Anglican service in her memory. \"Jo was someone who went out of her way to help others. I regret to say I didn't know what she was like as a girl, but she grew into a fervent advocate for the poor and oppressed,\" Knight continued. Charity fund for humanitarian causes To further honor her memory, friends of Cox's have set up a charity fund that made its 500,000 pound goal ($718,000) in less than a day following 17,000 donations. The money has been split evenly among her three favorite charities: Hope Not Hate, a UK group that seeks to challenge and defeat the politics of hate and extremism within local communities; White Helmets, a grassroots, volunteer civil defense organization that operates throughout opposition-controlled Syria and the Royal Voluntary Service (RVS), a UK organization set up in 1938 to involve women in preparing for civil-defense in the time of war. The patron of the RVS is Queen Elizabeth II, and its 35,000 volunteers provide practical services to older and housebound people every day, such as Meals on Wheels, Good Neighbours and community transport. \"The system was overwhelmed with the scale and speed of the donations,\" said Nick Grono, head of the Freedom Fund, an NGO combating modern-day slavery and Jo Cox's former employer. Farage: I'm a 'victim' of political hatred Sunday also saw the resumption of campaigning for Britain's EU referendum. Some have argued that Jo Cox's murderer may have been spurred on by the anti-immigration feeling stirred up by the Brexit campaign. On the day of her death, the Leave campaign and its leader, UKIP head Nigel Farage, presented a new poster connecting the influx of refugees to Europe to the EU's \"failure\" of Britain. Farage has refused to apologize or rescind the poster, although it depicts migrants in the EU nation of Slovenia. He has also referred to himself as a \"victim\" of political hatred determined to blame the Leave camp for Cox's death, in an interview on British television on Sunday. Cox's suspected killer, 52-year-old Thomas Mair, refused to give his real name when he appeared in court on Saturday, instead saying \"death to traitors, freedom for Britain.\"",

"story": "Germany Irked by US Approach to Missile Shield American plans to station part of an anti-missile system in Poland and the Czech Republic without consulting Russia met with criticism from German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, according to a media report. The proximity of the US missile batteries to the Russian border should have convinced officials in Washington of the need to brief their counterparts in Moscow about plans to build portions of an anti-missile shield in the two eastern European countries. \"One should have spoken with Russia earlier as the sites where they (the missiles) are to be stationed are edging closer to Russia,\" Steinmeier told the German business daily Handelsblatt in an interview to be published Monday. \"Given the strategic nature of such projects, I call for a prudent approach and intensive dialogue with all partners who are directly or indirectly affected.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin last week accused the United States of making the world a more place with its plans for an anti-missile system. \"One-sided illegitimate action hasn't solved a single problem and has become a generator of many human tragedies, a source of tension,\" Putin said. Iran not a threat to Europe US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates insisted that the missile system, which calls for placing 10 interceptor missiles in Poland and the Czech Republic, was not directed against Russia but to protect Europe from missiles launched in the Middle East. Steinmeier, however, dismissed any potential threat posed by Iranian rockets, saying Tehran did not possess the technology to make such an attack. He also spoke out against any immediate new sanctions against Iran over its nuclear policies. \"The most recent resolution of the UN Security Council does not contain any automatic mechanism for the situation where Iran does not fulfill its obligations,\" he said. US waiting for Poland's official answer The leader of the oppositions Greens party, Fritz Kuhn, said the German government needed to make it clear to US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during her visit to Berlin this week that it would not support placing missiles in the two EU and NATO member countries. \"What the USA is doing can only be understood by Russia as a provocation,\" he told Monday's Saarbr\u00fccker Zeitung. Exactly how much criticism Germany needs to give the US remains unclear as Poland has yet to decide if it will allow the Americans to station missiles within the country. \"We are preparing an answer that I think we will give to the American administration by diplomatic means within two weeks,\" new Polish Defense Minister Aleksander Szczyglo told Poland's PAP news agency on Sunday.",

"story": "More troops and new strategy for Afghanistan will be hard to come by The dire situation in Afghanistan, highlighted by the call for more troops by NATO's top commander there, is forcing the alliance to make tough decisions. Surprisingly, Europe and the US are closer than before. Whatever decisions President Barack Obama and other NATO leaders make in response to General Stanley McChrystal's assessment of the conflict in Afghanistan, they won't be able to claim later on they didn't understand the message NATO's chief commander in the country wanted to convey in his report. In clear and undiplomatic language, the head of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) spells out how he views the options the alliance is facing. \"Success is not ensured by additional forces alone, but continued underresourcing will likely cause failure,\" is how McChrystal describes his call to send more troops to Afghanistan. The second component for possible success \"is the urgent need for a significant change to our strategy and the way that we think and operate.\" While the two pillars - more soldiers and a new strategy - needed to make progress in Afghanistan are clearly laid out in the report, experts and even McChrystal himself are not sure whether they can be implemented by NATO member states where public opinion is growing increasingly weary of the war, now in its eigth year. The old dividing lines that have existed for a long time regarding the war in Afghanistan are still there, notes Daniel Korski, an Afghanistan expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations. \"It's the division of those who want to committ more assets and those who would rather pull out.\" But, he adds, unlike before the lines between both camps can't be drawn geographically anymore. \"I think it's a division that cuts across both the alliance and within certain member states, but not in sort of neat ways and certainly not in terms of Old Europe and New Europe that Donald Rumsfeld talked about.\" Skeptical Americans But while Europeans on a whole have for a long time had their doubts and concerns about the war in Afghanistan, in the US public opinion has grown increasingly skeptical toward the mission as well. According to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll 51 percent of Americans now oppose sending more troops to Afghanistan. \"More and more people feel that it is a never ending story, that this war has been dragging on now for longer than the second world war, that we see too little results and we really don't know why we are there,\" is how Patrick Keller, Foreign and Security Policy Coordinator at the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, a think tank affiliated with the German Christian Democrats, sums up the shift in the United States. \"And this is a situation that is pretty similar to that in Europe and it's a difficult political issue, especially at a time when the administration is spending most its political capital on domestic issues such as healthcare,\" he adds. Whether or not the increasingly negative perception of the Afghanistan effort among the US public, but also within the foreign policy establishment, translates into political decisions could decide the future of the Afghan mission. The US currently provides 30,000 of the 65,000 ISAF troops in Afghanistan. Should Washington reassess the situation and not opt for increasing the funds and troop levels for Afghanistan as requested by General McChrystal it could signal to the international community that the US has given up on the country. What's more, President Obama has a lot of other tough issues to deal with such as the economic crisis, health care reform, Iran's nuclear program and the upcoming climate conference. Still, it will be difficult for him to turn down General McChrystal. \"It's very hard to see that President Obama given all the things he said in the past about George Bush's strategy, would deny a direct request from the ground commanders for additional troops,\" says Korski. Few European troops Even more so, because the US shouldn't count on Europe to come up with more soldiers to fulfill McChrystal's request. \"It's very difficult at this point to see a lot of European countries rushing to deploy more troops,\" says Korski. \"And in going forward we will probably see the British offer some more troops, perhaps the Danes as well, but many other countries are really looking the other direction.\" While the first demand of McChrystal's request - more troops - may be hard to fulfill, his second demand - a new strategy - may prove even harder to implement. McChrystal said so himself in the report: \"ISAF is a conventional force that is poorly configured for COIN (comprehensive counterinsurgency), inexperienced in local languages and culture, and struggling with challenges inherent to coalition warfare.\" To win in Afghanistan, argues McChrystal, ISAF troops must eschew their traditional role of combat soldier and switch to that of a counterinsurgency operator who basically lives among the local population and protects it. That, however, as the head of ISAF wrote himself, presents a huge challenge for most troops. \"It's going to be very difficult for any other army bar the US, the Brits and perhaps one or two other countries to adopt to this unless we see a real push by the NATO secretary general to turn mentoring of Afghan forces and cooperation with Afghan civilians into a key focus for the alliance,\" argues Korski. But even if ISAF is able to retool its mission, which will take time, it will come with a higher risk for the individual soldier. That in turn could make it difficult to sustain the effort to war-weary constituencies in the US and Europe. \"I think given how bad the situation in Afghanistan is, if you consider that we are there now for more than eight years and how relatively little progress there has been made, it is important to really consider a change in strategy even if that might lead to more casualties because in the long run with the current strategy we will also fail to convince our publics to support it,\" says Keller. Despite the recent negative turn of events in Afghanistan both Keller and Korski believe that a turnaround, not a victory in a classical sense, is still possible. \"Can we build a capability in the Afghan government so that it can not destroy but contain the insurgency while gradually over time drawing more and more ordinary Afghans onto its side,\" is how Korski frames the question of success in Afghanistan. \"That is what our objective ought to be and that is what probably can still be done at this stage.\" Author: Michael Knigge Editor: Rob Mudge",

"story": "Russia mulls resuming direct flights to Egypt Russia's top diplomat has announced Moscow's intentions to resume flights to Egypt after 2015's aviation tragedy. Metrojet, the downed aircraft's operator, was banned from undertaking domestic and international flights. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov announced on Wednesday that Moscow was working with Egyptian authorities to resume \"direct air links\" to Egypt, in comments carried by Russia's state-owned TASS news agency. \"We agreed to restore air links as soon as possible, provided the highest security standards are guaranteed for Russian citizens,\" Lavrov said after meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry in the nation's capital. Moscow banned all direct flights to Egypt in November after a Russian passenger plane was downed over the Sinai Peninsula shortly after taking off from Sharm el-Sheikh, a well-known tourist destination on the Red Sea. The \"Islamic State\"-affiliated militant group Sinai Province claimed responsibility for bringing down the Airbus A321 aircraft by smuggling a bomb onto the passenger plane. In a statement posted online, the militant group said the attack was made in retaliation for Russian airstrikes against \"Islamic State\" targets in Syria. Russian investigators confirmed the plane was brought down by an explosive device, although Egyptian authorities said there was a lack of evidence to prove the militant group's claims. 'Security for our citizens' Lavrov said Russian and Egyptian authorities have been in contact to ensure the necessary security measures have been implemented by Cairo. \"Specific recommendations were formulated. Our specialists are certain they will provide reliable security for our citizens who travel to Egypt and from Egypt by air. The Egyptian side has considered these recommendations and, as far as I understand, were supported in general,\" added Russia's top diplomat. Egypt's Red Sea tourist destinations, including Sharm el-Sheikh and Hurghada, were considered some of the most popular vacation spots for Russian citizens prior to the aviation disaster. Moscow's decision to ban direct civilian flights to Egypt further damaged the country's ailing tourism industry, one of its main sources of foreign currency. Meanwhile, Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency on Wednesday banned Kogalymavia, which operated the downed flight under the name Metrojet, from undertaking international and domestic flights due to \"discrepancies and violations\" following safety inspections, TASS reported.",

"story": "Ukraine's pro-Western parties begin talks after electoral triumph Ukraine's pro-Western parties have begun coalition talks after securing the most votes in Sunday's parliamentary elections. The new government is tasked with quelling a pro-Russian insurgency in the country's east. With most ballots counted, the parties in Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's bloc won around 21.5 percent of the votes in Sunday's elections. The People's Front group of Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk had a slight advantage, with 21.9 percent. \"Talks have already begun,\" said Yuriy Lutsenko of Poroshenko's party on Monday. The pro-European Samopomich (Self-Help) party came third with 11 percent. The Opposition bloc, a pro-Kremlin organization, took fourth with just under 10 percent, followed by the populist Radical Party at just over seven percent, and the Fatherland party of former premier Yulia Tymoshenko between five and six percent. The nationalist Svoboda party, with between and four and five percent, failed to clear the five percent hurdle required for a place in the country's parliament. The initial results, which only take into account party voting for half the seats in the 450-strong parliament (the other half is made up of constituency votes), are in line with pre-election expectations that a pro-Western parliament would be voted in with the aim of steering Ukraine away from Russian influence, in the first parliamentary election since the ouster of pro-Moscow president Viktor Yanukovych in February. A 'victory of democracy' The European Union has described the elections as a victory of democracy and reforms in the ex-Soviet state. \"Congratulations to the people of Ukraine! Victory of democracy and European reforms agenda,\" tweeted Jose Manuel Barroso, head of the European Commission, on Monday. US President Barack Obama also hailed the \"successful\" vote as an \"important milestone in Ukraine's democratic development.\" \"We look forward to the convening of the new parliament and the quick formation of a strong, inclusive government,\" Obama said in a statement on Monday. The US president criticized the Russian involvement in the ongoing crisis in eastern Ukraine in which armed rebels have waged a war against Kyiv's authority. \"It is clear that Russian authorities occupying Crimea and Russian-backed separatists in parts of eastern Ukraine prevented many Ukrainian citizens from exercising their democratic rights to participate in national elections and cast their votes,\" he said, adding that the US \"will not recognize any election held in separatist-held areas that does not comport with Ukrainian law and is not held with the express consent and under the authority of the Ukrainian government.\" Moscow has welcomed the outcome of the election as backing for \"a peaceful resolution\" of the conflict. There has been a lull in fighting since Kyiv and insurgents signed a Moscow-backed truce on September 5; however, ceasefire violations have been quite frequent, particularly around the Donetsk airport. A fiery reminder More fighting was reported on Monday near the government-held coastal city of Mariupol as a reminder of the challenge ahead for President Poroshenko and Prime Minister Yatsenyuk. According to the news agency AFP, the pro-Russian rebels fired dozens of rockets from the city of Donetsk towards a Ukrainian military base in the area. The Ukrainian military authorities said two of its soldiers died in a rebel attack on Sunday near Lugansk. shs/glb (AFP, dpa)",

"story": "Germany's opposition slams Berlin refugee deal Germany's opposition parties have criticized a deal forged by coalition partners to control migration flows in Germany, saying it produces \"little concrete action.\" Germany has struggled to cope with the influx. Robert Habeck, a member of Germany's opposition Green Party, lambasted a migrant deal struck on Thursday by leaders of the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavarian sister-party the Christian Social Union (CSU) and its coalition partner the Social Democrats (SPD). \"In other countries, most people have to wait a year before they can even apply for asylum. In this context, it is a complete mystery how the Federal government intends to conclude the process at special registration centers within a few weeks,\" Habeck told DPA news agency. Top Left Party politician, Bernd Riexinger, further pointed to the plan creating new problems. \"There's the danger that these people won't receive a fair asylum procedure,\" Riexinger said. The deal - announced by Chancellor Angela Merkel, Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel and Bavarian premier Horst Seehofer on Thursday - purports to set up three to five reception centers where asylum seekers must wait until a decision is made on their application. It would also penalize those who would leave the centers' grounds multiple times. Prior to the deal, the SPD was critical of proposals for transit zones and migrant detention centers. However, Thursday's coalition agreement has been hailed by the center-left party as a step forward to managing the migration crisis. 'Little concrete action' Meanwhile, Habeck, the Greens' politician, who wants to be the party's top candidate for the 2017 parliamentary elections, said he also considers it wrong to restrict family reunification, one of the latest provisions to be accepted under the deal, which would impede family reunification until the refugee has lived in Germany for two years. \"In sum, the proposals bring little concrete action - except a truce between the CDU and SPD,\" Habeck said. Germany has struggled to cope with the wave of migration, which has stretched the country's capacities to register and house asylum seekers. Between 800,000 and one million migrants are expected to arrive in the country in 2015. The EU Commission said Thursday it is working with a \"technical assessment\" that posits three million migrants entering the 28-nation bloc by 2017. ls/kms (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

"story": "Stop the nonsense: homeopathy has no place in medicine On Thursday, more than 500 doctors will meet in Bremen for the 165th Annual Congress of Homeopathic Doctors. It\u2019s scandalous that medical professionals still adhere to such superstitions, says DW's Fabian Schmidt. Homeopathy is nothing but an obscure mistaken belief. It explains alleged successes in healing patients with a mystic and magic \"memory of water,\" with ominous \"energy\" and \"vibrations.\" This hocus-pocus is no more scientific than Santeria incantations by Haitian voodoo priests. Homeopathy has been clearly proven to be pharmaceutically useless in proper medical trials. Therefore, its only place is in the cabinet of horrors of historical medical and anthropological research institutions. The best would be to store homeopathy in the last corner on some dusty shelf, somewhere hidden far away behind behind Berlin's famous 19th century doctor Rudolf Virchow's pathological collections of jars with diseased body parts and organs. After all, his terrifying exhibits were part of real scientific medical research. They represent the foundation of our modern medicine. Medicine must not be arbitrary Since Virchow researched cells and his contemporary Robert Koch discovered the importance of bacteria a lot has happened: Our medical research today is focusing on the level of molecules. With the decoding of the human genome, medicine has become better and more powerful than ever before. At no point in history have humans better understood how all the various processes in the body influence each other. Never before have we known more about the functions of all those enzymes, hormones and proteins. Today, even the use of custom made molecules for individual treatment is a common practice against some cancers. It's called personalized medicine. Scientific knowledge today is precise, thorough and verifiable. That's why the medical profession must not allow medicine to be devalued by unscientific and ideologically tainted belief-systems from the Napoleonic era. There must be no place for such arbitrariness in this noble scientific discipline. Doctors need to take a stand For the sake of their own reputations, but even more for the protection of patients and customers, the medical professional organizations, universities and the research-based pharmaceutical companies must take a clear stand: homeopathy must be outlawed. It has no place in medical practices, pharmacies or serious research laboratories. The curricula of medical faculties also need to be free of these esoteric teachings. Leave the globuli - the homeopathic tablets - to those who can really use them: to historians, who are researching the errors of ancient medicine, to anthropologists who are looking into creepy superstitious rites or to the incorrigible shamans and druids. At least those self-appointed healers do not have a medical license.",

"story": "Egypt bans Hamas, labels it a terrorist organization An Egyptian court has banned all activities by the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Egypt. Cairo\u2019s relations with the group have fallen apart since president Morsi\u2019s military-backed ouster. A Cairo court on Tuesday ruled on the ban and ordered that Hamas offices in the country be shut down and all dealings with the group suspended. The court also branded Hamas as a terrorist organization. The country's relations with Hamas, which rules neighboring Gaza Strip, have sharply deteriorated since the military removed Islamist president Mohammed Morsi last July. Hamas, the Palestinian chapter of Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, denounced the move saying it \"serves the [Israeli] occupation.\" Egyptian officials have accused Hamas of plotting with Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood to carry out \"terror attacks\" in the country. The country's new military-installed authorities, led by military chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, were angered by Hamas officials who openly criticized their decision to outlaw the Muslim Brotherhood, the target of a deadly crackdown since Morsi's ouster. hc/ccp (AFP, AP)",

"story": "Czech court keeps Europe waiting The Czech Republic's highest court said it will deliver a ruling next week on a complaint filed by Czech senators against the European Union's Lisbon Treaty, which could hold up reform of the unwieldy 27-member bloc. The Czech Constitutional Court heard the case Tuesday and will likely announce its decision on Tuesday, November 3, according to secretary-general of the court, Tomas Langasek. The proceedings at the Czech Constitutional Court have stirred intense international interest because the Lisbon Treaty, designed to streamline the administrative and decision-making processes in the EU, hangs in the balance. The Czech Republic is the only country yet to ratify the treaty. Without its signature, the European Commission, the EU's executive body, would be in legal limbo and unable to fill appointments set to expire at the end of this month. \"Only when we have legal clarity about the (Lisbon) Treaty can we decide about the new top posts in the EU,\" said Sweden's Minister for European Affairs, Cecilia Malmstrom, whose country currently hold the rotating EU presidency. The group of Czech senators who filed the complaint say the treaty undermines national sovereignty and is at odds with the Czech constitution. Czech President Vaclav Klaus has also been very critical of the treaty, demanding an \"opt-out\" clause with regard to the EU's human rights charter. Klaus has said that if the treaty were approved as is, it would allow ethnic Germans, expelled under the Benes Decrees in postwar Czechoslovakia to reclaim their property and file damage claims. Slovakia now eager to have the same privilege The move by the Czechs has led neighboring Slovakia to demand a similar opt-out. Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajcak on Monday said his country \"would insist on the same political and legal protections as the Czech Republic\" because it shares the same post-World War II law that deported millions of ethnic Germans and Hungarians from then-united Czechoslovakia. Most legal experts say the Czech court, which has already rejected one challenge by the Senate, will throw out the senators' appeal. It could issue a ruling on Tuesday, or take longer to do so. Czech Prime Minister Jan Fischer, who would like to see the Lisbon Treaty ratified, said on Monday that he did not expect the final ruling until later. Rejection of the appeal would give President Klaus the legal authority to sign the Lisbon Treaty. He cannot sign before the ruling. However, if the court accepts the appeal, the Czech constitution would have to be changed to allow ratification. And this could be a lengthy process with an uncertain outcome. gb/dpa/AP/Reuters Editor: Nancy Isenson",

"story": "Germany's corporate battle of the sexes Why are women so hugely underrepresented in senior positions in German business? Are they being prevented from getting ahead in Europe's powerhouse? Or do they have themselves to blame? Lisa Ellis reports. It is a scene that seems unremarkable at first. A woman walks into a meeting at a multinational company in Germany. She is asked by one of the men at the table to pour the coffee. The problem is she is not the caterer. She is one of the executives about to take part in the meeting with clients. This anecdote is told by consultant Philine Erfurt Sandhu who was brought in by the company to try to improve gender balance. Sandhu says the above incident is not a one-off. She hears such stories \"regularly.\" It is an example of what Sandhu calls the \"Thomas Syndrome.\" The idea that the typical senior manager in Germany is a 53-year-old white male called \"Thomas\" who would rather recruit a clone of himself than a woman. The chances of making it to the top as a woman in Germany are unusually low. A recent survey shows German women fare far worse than their counterparts in other advanced countries. In the US, the percentage of blue-chip firms with at least 30 percent female representation on the board is 30 percent. In Germany it is zero. Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media Monika Gr\u00fctters declared Germany \"bottom of the pile\" when it comes to the number of women in senior positions in business. How did women end up at such a disadvantage? Sandhu, who spent a year observing at the multinational, says the reasons are varied but several stand out. Key among them is the tendency of male executives to hire and promote people who look like them, sometimes unconsciously but often intentionally. \"There are advantages to working with people just like you,\" she argues. \"There is less conflict, you don't have to question your identity, and decision making is easier. But it doesn't necessarily produce the best results for the company,\" says Sandhu. The same men establish networks, which are difficult for women to penetrate. Such networks come about when men realize they like the same football team or drink the same wine and then start pursuing their hobbies as a group outside of working hours, says Sandhu. \"Women tend not to do this,\" she observes. \"They are more likely to limit their relationships to the office.\" This is a crucial mistake and one reason why women are at least partly to blame for failing to reach the top tier of management, according to Christoph Z\u00f6ller, CEO and co-founder of recruitment startup Instaffo in Heidelberg. \"Women, for example.... often don't go for the classic 'beer after work' which is vital for your career in many executive circles,\" Z\u00f6ller writes in a post on his company's blog about what women are \"doing wrong.\" \"They are also more cautious in negotiations and accept things as fair that a man would never accept,\" 26-year old Z\u00f6ller says in a phone conversation with DW. Generalizing about a whole group based on gender? Z\u00f6ller believes men and women are \"intrinsically different,\" each with characteristics important to the running of a successful company. He points out that women in the marketing division of Instaffo often make more money than men as they have \"nicer voices\" on the phone. \"[But] Women are more likely to voluntarily leave management duties to men,\" according to Z\u00f6ller. At the end of the day, though, it essentially comes down to one thing. \"There is very strong competition to get to the top. If a woman decides to have a child \u2014 and then raise that child, then she is going to be missing for around five or six years out of a 30-year career. That has to be taken in to account,\" says Z\u00f6ller. Having a child may explain why a woman doesn't have time go for that drink after work. But is it the reason women are failing to make it to the upper echelons? A look at the career of executive Birgit Felden suggests the answer to this is both yes and no. Felden, a 51-year-old professor and mother of two is at the top of her game. She sits on the supervisory boards of three companies, teaches part of a university course for female business leaders and owns a successful consultancy. However, she says she knew at the start of her career 25 years ago that she would only be able to reach this position by becoming her own boss rather than trying to advance as a woman in someone else's firm. \"I decided to start my own business because I didn't want to have to explain to the HR department of some big company that I was going to have both children and a career.\" For Felden, having women at the top is not just about equality, it is about ensuring the continued economic success of the country. \"Diversity at a high level brings benefits,\" she says. \"Businesses need to be made aware of that. It is also a question of demography. In 20 years or so, there just won't be enough middle-aged white men. So we need to change.\"",

"story": "Venezuela meets international creditors as debt default looms Following months of violent protests, Venezuela is meeting with creditors to discuss ways out of what seems to be inevitable default. Meanwhile, the EU slapped a new set of sanctions on the South American nation. Venezuela started meeting a host of its creditors in Caracas to discuss government proposals to restructure at least 60 billion dollars of junk bonds in a bid to ease the country's massive debt burden. Some investors have, however, expressed concern in advance that the meeting was only a ruse for President Nicolas Maduro to seek longer repayment periods for the bonds. This could lead to Venezuela's eventual debt default, with the country's total debt estimated to be at least $150 billion (\u20ac130 billion). Maduro said that 414 investors and representatives of investment banks, which amounted to 91 percent of holders of Venezuelan bonds, would attend the meeting near the presidential palace. However, there had been earlier reports that some of the creditors would not be able to attend the meeting amid concern that the delegation of Venezuelan negotiators could include people who are presently under US sanctions. Venezuela has been in a massive recession since Maduro succeeded the late president Hugo Chavez in 2013. A drop in oil prices has contributed to a galloping shortage of basic goods in the cash-strapped country, where inflation is expected to reach 1,000 percent this year. Meanwhile, a default declaration of the PDVSA state oil company is seen as almost inevitable. The committee of the Internal Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), has agreed to reconvene on Tuesday to determine PDVSA's fate. Persona non grata The head of the committee charged with negotiating a deal, Vice President Tareck El Aissami, is one of the politicians targeted by US sanctions, with Washington accusing El Aissami of drug trafficking. To encourage attendance, Venezuela has reportedly said that Vice President El Aissami won't physically attend the meeting \u2014 despite being put in charge of the restructuring the country's debt. It was unclear whether Venezuelan Finance Minister Simon Zerpa, another individual targeted by US sanctions for alleged corruption, would be present. The prospects for reaching any agreement are complicated by the sanctions imposed on Venezuela and on many senior officials, which prohibit any US person or bank from buying the country's debt. About 70 percent of Venezuelan bondholders are North American, according to government figures, while China and Russia also hold a considerable share. During his weekly television speech on Sunday, President Nicolas Maduro insisted his country would \"never\" default on the country's debt, adding that Venezuela's strategy is to \"renegotiate and refinance all the debt.\" He highlighted talks with allies China and Russia \u2014 Venezuela owes China $28 billion and Russia $8 billion. Russia has already agreed to restructure $3 billion in loans. EU sanctions The meeting started just after the European Union adopted its own set of targeted sanctions earlier in the day targeting \"those involved in the non-respect of democratic principles or the rule of law.\" The sanctions include a ban on arms sales as well as travel restrictions and asset freezes on individuals deemed to be in violation of human rights. Caracas has meanwhile criticized the sanctions as \"illegal\" and \"absurd.\" The EU sanctions came after the bloc declared that it would not recognize Venezuela's Constituent Assembly, a chamber of loyalists appointed by Maduro in August designed to usurp parliamentary powers. The EU said that its creation had \"further eroded the democratic and independent institutions.\" Amid all the international pressure, thousands of Venezuelans have fled to neighboring countries and more than 120 people have been killed in anti-government protests so far this year. ss/dv (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters, EFE)",

"story": "German Reality Shows in Need of Reality Check Reality shows are increasingly attracting the ire of critics -- some who object to the way animals are treated on a new farm docu-soap, and others who worry about the effects such shows have on the human participants. \"Die Alm\" or \"The Alps,\" is a sort of alpine-reality-docu-soap, in which a slew of German B-list celebrities gets down and dirty with everyday life on an alpine farm. Of course, no alpine pasture would be complete without real live farm animals, which provide the celebs with countless opportunities to boost ratings by engaging in gross-out stunts such as having goats lick syrup off their bodies, or sucking milk from a cow's udder. But the last straw for German animal activists came when a recent episode showed a turkey being slaughtered. Now, the German Society for the Protection of Animals (DTB) says it's looking at taking legal steps against the show, which runs on Munich-based private broadcaster, ProSieben. \"We don't care if third-rate celebrities bathe in manure or throw themselves naked down a hillside,\" said DTB head Thomas Schr\u00f6der. \"But animals can't say yes or no. The show has overstepped the legal and ethical boundaries.\" ProSieben is nonplussed but intends to continue airing the show as planned. Tuesday evening's episode includes showing the candidates how to empty the intestines of a freshly slaughtered pig, for later use as sausage casings. The executive in charge of the show, Christian Asanger, has even invited members of the animal society out to the mountain pasture. \"We have nothing to hide,\" he said. Makeover-shows also a target In a world where there's no such thing as bad publicity, experts say such protests are a welcome additional marketing strategy for the shows, which thrive on high ratings and advertising revenue. If that's true, then other German reality TV shows which feature plastic surgery and makeovers instead of farm animals can also expect a ratings boost. Cologne-based private broadcaster RTL II whipped up a storm of protest last week when it announced it would let candidates participating in its \"Big Brother\" reality show undergo cosmetic surgery. The German Association of Plastic Surgeons (VD\u00c4PC) objected, not just to \"Big Brother,\" but also to other makeover reality shows that recently hit the German airwaves. In MTV's \"I Want a Famous Face,\" teens put themselves at the mercy of plastic surgeons in order to wake up looking like stars such as Brad Pitt or Kate Winslet. ProSieben's \"The Swan\" is a reality TV-show format imported from the US, in which ugly ducklings are turned into\u2026well, swans, with the help of plastic surgeons, fitness trainers, nutritionists and psychologists. The most beautiful \"swan\" to emerge out of the 16 candidates wins a modeling contract. Don't blame plastic surgeons These shows are giving plastic surgery a bad name, according to the VD\u00c4PC. \"What we do is medical work. We treat patients. We don't sell the product 'beauty',\" said the association's senior president, Constanze Neuhann-Lorenz. In a letter sent to the association's 120 members, president Rolf R\u00fcdiger Olbrisch wrote: \"Let's protect ourselves from landing in the wrong hands and wrong publicity, of the wrong business.\" Germany's media regulatory board said certain boundaries have to be respected, even in an industry that's all about erasing the boundaries between private and public life. \"Showing plastic surgery can hurt the dignity of a human being, even if the person having the surgery doesn't have a problem with it,\" said the head of the director's conference for Germany's state media boards, Wolfgang Thaenert. \"Basically, it's about respecting the final boundaries that touch on human dignity.\"",

"story": "Sieren's China: Skewing the figures It is very difficult to comprehend China's official economic data, but there are reliable indicators for evaluating the Chinese economy, says DW's Frank Sieren. On Monday, China revised its growth rate for 2014 downwards. However, it is difficult to understand this from the outside. According to the National Bureau of Statistics in Beijing, the world's second-largest economy grew by 7.3 percent instead of 7.4 percent. This, of course, has triggered discussions once again on how reliable Chinese economic data actually is. One argument is that Chinese statisticians interpret figures as they see fit. Of course, there are also political guidelines. Just as the Communist Party controls the media, it also controls the figures. However, this does not mean that it manipulates the figures haphazardly. On the contrary: Over the past 20 years, it has been clear that most of the figures seem plausible when taken in relation to one another. This does not mean that they are correct though. It is incredible that this year Beijing has twice been able to make a precision landing. China's GDP was exactly 7 percent in the past two quarters. Incredible but not impossible. This is why there have been the most diverse reactions: Commerzbank CEO Martin Blessing recently put the figures that the Chinese government had released on the country's economic growth in doubt. But people at Deutsche Bank think that fears of a crisis are exaggerated. Unreliable data not an isolated case The fact that data can only be verified with difficulty is not only valid for China but for other economies. Let's recall the financial crisis in the US in 2008 and 2009, when the state did not know what kind of risks the banks were running. Even the banks did not know. In China, the probability that data could be wrong is much bigger. China is much less transparent and has grown extremely fast over the past two decades. But we are not simply defenseless and at the mercy of those skewing the figures in Beijing. There are some figures that cannot be falsified so easily. These include exports, which can be cross-checked with international data, and foreign exchange reserves, which are invested internationally. They also include external debts and the dollar-yuan exchange rate. These can at least be used to predict big crises. According to these figures, the current situation in China is difficult but not grave. Exports in August fell by over 6 percent. At 1.67 trillion dollars, external debt is low. Foreign currency reserves are falling a little, but remain very, very high at 3.56 trillion dollars. And the yuan is still valued very high, despite the recent devaluation. No deep recession on the horizon A deep recession - like that in Brazil with minus 2 percent growth, or in Russia - is not on the horizon for China at all. The stability of the Chinese economy would be in serious danger if three developments that can be reliably measured were to occur at the same time: A double-digit depreciation of the yuan to stimulate the economy. If China had to reduce foreign exchange reserves by over a trillion dollars. And if China incurred debts abroad. Therefore, we can rule out a big crisis for the moment. Frank Sieren has lived in Beijing for 20 years.",

"story": "Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal ends exile with Gaza visit Khaled Meshaal, the leader-in-exile of Hamas, has crossed into Gaza for the first time ever. There is fierce speculation over whether the visit marks a political comeback for Meshaal or the end of his time as leader. The exiled leader of Hamas, the political group that runs the Gaza Strip, set foot on Palestinian soil for the first time in 45 years on Friday. Khaled Meshaal, who has not returned to the Palestinian Territories since he left the West Bank aged eleven, kissed the soil on his arrival before greeting Gaza's prime minister, Ismail Haniya of Hamas. Meshaal was accompanied by his deputy, Mussa Abu Marzuk, and a party of other senior officials as he drove through the Gaza crossing. Meshaal will stay in Gaza for around 48 hours. He is expected to attend an open-air rally on Saturday, which will celebrate Hamas' 25th anniversary and what the group refers to as its victory against Israel last month. Bouncing back or saying goodbye? Meshaal, who survived an Israeli assassination attempt in Jordan in 1997, was based in Syria from 2004 until January this year; by that point the war between Syrian President Assad and rebels meant the arrangement was no longer workable. The position of the 56-year-old briefly suffered as a result- he had derived much of his authority from cultivating close ties with both Damascus and Tehran from that base. But the exiled leader, who now runs Hamas from Qatar and Cairo, regained ground during the confrontation which erupted between Israel and Gaza on November 14 and left 174 Palestinians and six Israelis dead. He worked closely with Cairo to broker the ceasefire which brought the fighting to an end. Nevertheless, there is speculation that Meshaal's Gaza trip marks the conclusion of a secret leadership election for his successor. Broader unease about the position of the Palestinian Territories vis a vis Israel parallels such uncertainty over leadership. At the end of November, the UN voted to upgrade the status of the Palestinian Territories to \"non-member observer status.\" But Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to plow ahead with controversial plans to build 3,000 settler homes in the West Bank, a move that German Chancellor Angela Merkel cautioned against during talks with Netanyahu in Berlin on Thursday. sej/rg (Reuters, AFP)",

"story": "For women in sports, London 2012 sets milestone The 2012 Olympics are historic for women in sports. Now that Saudi Arabia, Brunei and Qatar are sending female athletes for the first time, women will have competed for every Olympic country. Saudi Arabia was the last country to give the go-ahead after Brunei and Qatar previously agreed to do the same. Wodjan Ali Seraj Abdulrahim Shahrkhani will suit up for the 78-kilogram category in judo while Sarah Attar, 17, will run the 800 meters for Saudi Arabia. \"UN Women welcomes this decision as an important step and sign of progress in the path towards greater political, social and economic status of women and girls in the region,\"UN Women Deputy Director John Hendra told DW. When the first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens in 1896, women were forbidden from participating. Now, 116 years later, women from every nation will have taken to the field of Olympic competition. \"Even though it's a low number, [Saudi Arabia, Brunei and Qatar] are actually sending women to compete,\" said Lisa Maatz, Director of Public Policy and Government Relations for the American Association of University Women (AAUW), a US-based political advocacy group, in an interview with DW. \"I think it's progress.\" Making history The achievement is a long time coming. At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, 26 countries were yet to include female athletes. Twelve years later in Beijing, the number had dropped to three. The overall percentage of women participating has also increased dramatically. Just 1.8 percent of the athletes at the 1908 London Olympics were women. Of the 10,947 athletes who competed in 2008, 4,639 were women - more than 42 percent - according to the IOC's Women and Sport Commission. But it's not just where the women come from that's groundbreaking. It's also what the women will be doing. With the inclusion of women's boxing and wrestling, women will compete in every sport the men will for the first time. In fact, with men barred from synchronized swimming and rhythmic gymnastics, women will compete in more events than their male counterparts. \"It's a lot of firsts,\" said Maatz. Tentative progress The decision by Saudi Arabia - an absolute monarchy governed by a strict interpretation of Islamic, or Shariah, law - has been hailed as a step in the right direction for women's rights, albeit a tentative one. \"It's been a long time coming,\" Christoph Wilcke, senior Middle East researcher for New York-based Human Rights Watch, told DW. But Wilcke, a German native who has more than 15 years of experience in the Middle East, was quick to point out the country still has a long way to go in advancing women's rights - participation in sports included. Earlier this year, Human Rights Watch said that women in Saudi Arabia were excluded from the 153 sports clubs regulated by the General Presidency of Youth Welfare (GPYW), the Saudi National Olympic Committee, and 29 other sporting federations. Lasting impact While the achievements of women in this year's Olympics will be historic, many hope the impact will last longer than the July 27 - August 12 Games. Maatz, for one, said she hopes the women participating in the Olympics will serve as inspiration for girls and women. \"It can inspire a lot of little girls,\" she said. \"Hopefully more women come in 2016 [at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics].\" The UN's Hendra also sees the women competing as pioneers. \"Sport can also offer a forum for advocating for ending violence against women,\" said Hendra. \"And it is so true that role models and pioneers can bring about great changes for gender equality. There has been progress in recent years, like introducing quotas for women\u2019s representation in sports organizations.\" Despite this, Hendra said, gender stereotypes continue to play a major role in sports participation, structurally and in the heat of competition. About 10,500 athletes are expected to compete at the 2012 London Games, representing 204 nations. More than 40 percent of them will be women. Author: Benjamin Mack Editor: Mark Hallam",

"story": "Key European nations call for new sanctions against Belarus Key European nations are calling for new sanctions against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko as his regime continues to try and imprison former presidential candidates and opposition members. Poland, Germany and France have called on the European Union to impose sanctions against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. The new round of sanctions would target 13 other individuals and possibly certain companies. Brussels has already placed sanctions against around 150 people associated with President Lukashenko. \"Not a general embargo, but something which will make life difficult for companies which finance the regime,\" said Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski. \"We will increase pressure on the Belarus regime as long as it does not change its politics.\" German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said the sanctions would be designed to impact only the targeted officials. \"The sanctions will affect the regime, not the people,\" Westerwelle said. French Foreign Minister Alaine Juppe also hinted that he would back the sanctions. The EU's 27 foreign ministers are set to discuss Belarus when they meet in Brussels on Monday. Trials continue Belarusian courts continue to try and convict presidential candidates who ran against President Lukashenko in the election last December. Vladimir Neklyayev and Vitaly Rymashevsky were found guilty of organizing actions that violated public order. The sentences for both men were suspended by two years. Neklyayev credited his relatively soft sentence to support at home and abroad. \"If it was not for the support from the US and the European Union I would not be standing here in front of you but would rather be in prison answering the question about who I am spying for,\" he told reporters. \"This is (also) the result of people's solidarity.\" The convictions come after Lukashenko's main opponent during the December elections, Andrei Sannikov, was sentenced to five years in prison for organizing mass disturbances. Lukashenko won another term as president with 80 percent of the vote in an election in December condemned by the West as manipulated. Mass demonstrations erupted after the election, leading to a government crackdown in which hundreds of people were arrested. Author: Spencer Kimball (Reuters, AFP) Editor: Toma Tasovac",

"story": "Cologne considers emergency plan for Rose Monday holiday Just over a year since the collapse of the Cologne archives building, authorities have expressed concern over ongoing underground subway work in the city, German media says. Concerns over underground subway work in the western German city of Cologne prompted city authorities there to consider evacuation plans for the upcoming Rose Monday public holiday festivities, German media reports. The precautions come less than a year after the Cologne City Archives building collapsed into the ground, along with an apartment building, killing two people. The collapse occurred during building work aimed at expanding Cologne's underground train network. The buildings were above one of the construction sites. However, city manager Guido Kahlen said party-goers and locals were safe on Cologne's streets during the carnival festival. \"There is no danger of collapse,\" Kahlen told a news conference on Friday. \"Even during the festivities, we will be able to react quickly.\" The Rose Monday festival see hundreds of thousands of Germans descend upon Cologne, placing a huge strain on the city's streets and public transportation network. Extra precautions Cologne public prosecutors said they had communicated their concerns over the upcoming public holiday to the city's public transport authority, the KVB, which is overseeing the ongoing underground work, German newsmagazine Der Spiegel reported. City chiefs then reportedly consulted specialists to create an emergency plan for the area around Cologne's Waidmarkt tram stop. However, after further examination of the danger posed by the mass crowds the plan was reportedly dropped. Meanwhile, Cologne city authorities said Thursday they had learned that less than one-fifth of the steel brackets purchased for the underground line beneath the Heumarkt tram stop were in place, the daily Koelner Stadt-Anzeiger reported. The paper said that upon investigation it was found that 83 percent of the brackets, purchased to reinforce the concrete walls of the underground tunnels, were used during construction. Der Spiegel reported that the site's foreman and several employees were believed to have stolen many of the brackets and sold them to a scrap metal merchant. dfm/dpa/AFP Editor: Rob Turner",

"story": "German foreign minister Steinmeier warns on Crimean fallout German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier has warned that the crisis in Crimea could escalate. He threatened Russia with further sanctions if it tried to claim more Ukrainian territory for itself. Steinmeier, who visited Ukraine on Saturday, told the weekly \"Welt am Sonntag\" newspaper that he feared widening consequences of the crisis in Crimea, which on Friday was finally annexed by Russia. \"I am very worried that the attempt, contrary to international law, to correct the internationally recognized borders in our European neighborhood 25 years after the end of the Cold War could open a Pandora's box,\" he told the paper. He said he also wondered whether Russia, which itself includes many different ethnicities, had thought through the possible consequences of its actions. Steinmeier said that although the planned mission of observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) was a first step towards de-escalation, the situation, especially in eastern Ukraine, was \"still anything but stable.\" More sanctions threatened The German foreign minister also threatened Russia with more severe sanctions should it attempt to claim territory beyond Crimea's borders. \"If Russia reaches beyond Crimea, we in Europe will decide on radical measures, even if we have to accept economic disadvantages by doing so,\" he said. He also rejected criticism from some quarters that the West was not being firm enough in its measures against Russia. \"I can detect no weakness in our policies,\" he said. \"It is good and important that Europe and the USA act in close accord in this crisis. We are sending clear messages and we are reacting quickly and decisively,\" he added. Ukraine visit On Saturday, Steinmeier met with Ukraine's interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk in Kyiv, pledging German support to his pro-European Union government. He also traveled to the eastern city of Donetsk, where there is strong backing for a move toward Moscow, to hold talks with local officials. Steinmeier's remarks were published a day after pro-Russian troops seized the last major military facility still under Ukrainian control in Crimea, the Belbek air base near the western port city of Sevastopol. Two people were reportedly injured during the seizure. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday signed legislation to absorb the Ukrainian territory into the Russian Federation, after Crimean residents voted in a referendum to split from Ukraine in favor of Moscow. The referendum and the consequent annexation of Crimea by Russia have been met with widespread international condemnation, particularly from the West. The crisis in Crimea is likely to overshadow a two-day summit on nuclear terrorism starting Monday in the Netherlands. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is expected to hold talks there with his US counterpart John Kerry. tj/se (Reuters, dpa)",

"story": "Germans slow to bin plastics habit Germany has a reputation for being particularly environmentally conscious. Why then does the country produce so much plastic waste? And can Germans be persuaded to ditch the excess packaging? Bananas, slices of cheese, dishwasher tablets and countless other products all wrapped in often unnecessary plastic \u2014 that's what you'll see if you take a trip around the average German supermarket. The country's green image defies the extent of its love affair with the fossil fuel-based packaging. Germany is the biggest consumer of plastic in Europe, according to statistics compiled by Eurostat \u2014 and that tendency is growing alongside lifestyle changes like internet shopping, buying food and drink on the go, and living in single or small households. Read more: What to do about Germany's mounting packaging waste? The reliance on this durable and flexible material has a dirty flipside. Plastic has made its way into tap water via synthetic textiles, and our food chains via fish and seafood. Every year, 8 million tons of plastic makes its way into the world's oceans according to estimates from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, where it poses a danger to marine life and human health. Given that plastics never fully degrade, our legacy of broken flip flops, plastic bottles and microplastics washed out of fleece clothing will linger for generations, according to scientists. Read more: Plastic fibers pervasive in tap water worldwide, new study shows Still, in Germany, some are beginning to realize the impact of plastic use on the environment. Tom Ohlendorf, WWF's project manager for packaging, points to evidence of a mindset shift among some shoppers and retailers favoring plastic-free options. \"The awareness of retailers and consumers has risen,\" he said. \"Just look at initiatives like packaging-free supermarkets which have popped up in a number of German cities.\" Dumping plastic A small store in Berlin's Kreuzberg neighborhood is one of the businesses pioneering the move to go plastic-free: Original Unverpackt, which opened its doors three years ago, is a minimalistic affair, with white-tiled walls, wooden shelves and lines of dispensers where shoppers can fill their containers with grains, pulses and even shampoo. As well as fresh produce, the store sells bamboo toothbrushes, fair-trade condoms and cloth bags emblazoned with the phrase \"There is no planet B.\" Such stores are still a niche phenomenon. Their higher-than-average prices don't sit comfortably with German consumers' reputation as bargain hunters. But change is also emerging in the mainstream; now, supermarket giants are talking about shrinking their plastic footprint too. Shoppers in Edeka, and in Denn's organic supermarkets, for example, can use their own containers for purchases from cheese and meat counters, following in the footsteps of a number of coffee shops in Berlin and beyond, which encourage shoppers to purchase reusable cups. Germany's second-largest grocery retailer Rewe has adopted new dried grass and wood containers for organic apples. The chain is also evaluating the results of a pilot scheme that discouraged shoppers in some of its stores from reaching for translucent plastic bags in the fruit and vegetable aisles. The group told DW it's unclear when it will reach a conclusion on whether the scheme can be implemented in all stores. More to do Tobias Quast, an expert for waste and resources at Friends of the Earth in Berlin, welcomes the moves but dubs them \"initial attempts\" rather than a consumer u-turn: \"These pilot schemes do show that it is completely possible to expand the environmentally friendly idea of reusable containers,\" he told DW. \"But plans underway in German politics and retail are not ambitious enough, by far.\" Greener shopping habits, and policies such as a tax on firms producing plastic waste and a levy on plastic bags in stores, seem not to have stemmed the amount of plastic waste being produced. The most recent data from the EU's statistics office showed that German packaging in general, and plastic in particular, has climbed over recent years. Total packaging waste stood at 18.1 million tons in 2015 after climbing by around half a million tons for three years in a row. Environmental groups have also criticized new German packaging regulations, set to come into force in January 2019, for not going far enough. The law aims to strengthen recycling and reduce the prevalence of single-use bottles and packaging in general. Europe eyes tougher regulations Germany may soon get a further push to cut down on plastic from the EU. Citing the toll of plastic on our fish and our ocean, Brussels said it plans to make all plastic packaging in the bloc recyclable by 2030. European countries churn out 25 million tons of plastic waste every year. Less than a third is recycled. Observers noted how the bloc's new approach followed China's ban on imports of plastic waste, which may force the EU to either incinerate or dump its plastic. Read more: EU unveils plan to make all plastic packaging recyclable by 2030 Read more: Sieren's China: Beijing will take less of the world's trash Read more: 'Not enough action from EU on plastic' Startups around Europe are also experimenting with different approaches to wrapping produce. For instance, Prague-based Miwa has come up with refillable containers equipped with smart technology used to move foodstuffs from producers to consumers with minimum waste. The company has tested the process with a network of suppliers and outlets, and Miwa plans to open its first stores in fall 2018. The company, which recently won an innovation prize, was founded by Petr Baca, who worked for many years in packaging design and was acutely aware of the mounting waste problem. You just have to \"notice the negative impact of of single-use packaging,\" he said.

"story": "German nurse suspected in 24 more patient deaths A male German nurse has been accused of killing dozens of patients over the years with a potent heart drug. The suspected death toll would make him one of Germany's worst post-war serial killers. The number of possible murder victims rose of convicted male nurse Niels H. rose to at least 24, German police said on Wednesday. The former nurse was already found guilty of two murders and three attempted murders of intensive-care patients in February of 2015 and was imprisoned for life. Niels H. already admitted in court to injecting around 90 patients with an unprescribed heart drug and claimed to have killed around 30. After injecting his victims, he would then try to revive them in order to stand out amongst his peers. During the investigation, he said he felt overjoyed when he managed to bring a patient back from the brink of death, and was devastated when he failed. Police in the German town of Oldenburg said on Wednesday that they have exhumed and tested 77 sets of mortal remains from patients who had been under the care of Niels H. Besides the 24 suspicious cases where traces of the drug were found, police are still awaiting results from seven additional bodies. Police are looking into some 200 fatalities at the Delmenhorst hospital where Niels H. worked, as well as at the nurse's previous places of employment which include a nursing home, a clinic, and an emergency medical service. Investigators hope to have all the test results by mid-June, where they will then release detailed information to the public about the cases. The case dates back to 2005 when a coworker witnessed Niels H. administering the drug to a patient in Delmenhorst. After the patient survived, he was arrested and sentenced for attempted murder. A woman then contacted police, voicing suspicion that her mother may have also been a victim of the nurse - leading to the exhumations which sent Niels H. to prison for life. rs/kms (AFP, dpa)",

"story": "Thousands protest against neo-Nazis in Dresden More than 6,000 people from across Germany gathered in the eastern city of Dresden on Saturday to protest a planned Neo-Nazi demonstration, which was canceled beforehand. Thousands of protesters took part in an anti-neo-Nazi demonstration in the eastern German city of Dresden on Saturday. According to the organizers of the event, the left-wing group 'Nazi-free Dresden,' 10,000 people took to the streets. Police, who said the demonstrations were largely peaceful, said attendance was closer to 6,500. Protesters demanded that the right-wing NPD party be banned and that the police in the state of Saxony do more to bring neo-Nazis to book. Dresdencouncil had also organized an event at a separate location, which around 1,500 people attended, among them Saxony's state premier Stanislaw Tillich and Dresden mayor Dirk Hilbert. The demonstrations were originally intended to counteract a planned neo-Nazi march, which was called off after similar marches in 2010 and 2011 were successfully disrupted by anti-far-right protesters. An alternative neo-Nazi march in Gera, in eastern Thuringia, did not attract many demonstrators. Each February, Dresden commemorates the allied bombing and destruction of the city in World War II on February 13, 1945. Far-right groups from across Europe normally use the occasion to stage a march. Only in the last few years have they experienced large-scale organized resistance from groups like 'Nazi-free Dresden.' Dresden's mayor Hilbert said that it was no longer enough to commemorate in silence, but that it was crucial to also \"send a signal\" to the far-right. Sunday's demonstrations follow similar protests last Monday, when around 1,600 neo-Nazis gathered in Dresden. But the march had to be cut short because of massive counter-demonstrations. ng/ccp (epd, dpa)",

"story": "GM ditches Chevrolet in Europe to boost Opel, Vauxhall fortunes US auto giant General Motors (GM) has unveiled plans to withdraw its Chevrolet brand from markets in Europe. The move aims to strengthen GM\u2019s other struggling European brands, Opel in Germany and the UK\u2019s Vauxhall. General Motors (GM) will stop selling its Chevrolet models in European markets by 2015, Stephen Girsky, Vice Chairman at the US carmaker announced on Thursday. Speaking to investors in a conference call, Girsky said GM's decision came as part of efforts to focus resources on reviving the company's Opel brand. \u201cWe have growing confidence in the Opel and Vauxhall brands in Europe,\u201d Girsky said. German carmaker Opel and its UK equivalent Vauxhall have competed against Chevrolet for customers ever since GM introduced smaller Chevrolet models to European markets in 2005. While Opel/Vauxhall secured a 6.7 percent market share on the continent in recent years, Chevrolet barely managed to reach 1 percent. Moreover, Chevrolet sales slumped 17 percent year-on-year to just 25,000 cars by September. \u201cBasically we will shut down the 1-percent-share company in Europe. The financial results have been unacceptable,\u201d Girsky said. The GM vice chairman also said that the US auto giant would set aside up to $1 billion (740 million euros) over the next two years to cover the costs arising from closing Chevrolets about 1,900 dealerships in Europe. The move forms the latest effort by GM to turn around its European operations amid the ongoing car slump on the crisis-hit continent. GM also announced that it would continue to sell its smaller Chevrolet models in Russia and other former Soviet markets. In Western Europe, however, Chevrolet would only be present with its iconic Corvette model after 2016. uhe/pfd (dpa, Reuters, AFP)",

"story": "Quirks and firsts of the Nobel Prize Deceased winners, double laureates and famous refusals: With the 2013 Nobel Prizes set to be awarded, it's worth taking a look back at 112 years of award history. Just don't die before you're nominated... When Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel specified in his will that his fortune be used to create a foundation, his relatives were outraged - even trying to contest his decision in court. It wasn't until 1901, five years after Nobel's death, that the first Nobel prize was actually awarded. This year's Nobel Prize laureates will be announced by October 14. The award, which includes prizes in the categories of chemistry, literature, physics, physiology and medicine - as well as the Nobel Peace Prize - has had a rich history since 1901. A prize for the deceased Officially, you can't be nominated for a Nobel Prize if you're dead. But Swedes Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1961 and Erik Axel Karlfeldt, who won in 1931, were honored posthumously anyway, since they both passed away after being nominated, but before the winners had been announced. The practice was banned in 1974, only for the rule to be broken in 2011. When the Nobel Prize committee announced that Ralph Steinmann was to be honored with the Nobel Prize in Medicine, they didn't know that Steinmann had passed away three days before. In Steinmann's case, the committee made an exception and his heirs accepted the prize in his place. Second time's a charm So far, four scientists have managed to win two Nobel Prizes. John Bardeen of the US won the Nobel Prize in Physics twice - once for his discovery of the transistor effect in 1956 and a second time in 1972 for his theory of superconductivity. British biochemist Frederick Sanger was honored twice as well, once in 1958 and again in 1980. The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to him first for discovering the structure of insulin and again for discovering the method for sequencing DNA molecules. US chemist Linus Pauling received an unusual combination of awards. In 1954 he won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, which was followed up by a Nobel Peace Prize in 1962 for his ardent opposition to nuclear weapons testing. Women underrepresented Marie Curie is probably the most well known female Nobel Prize winner. She, too, won two Nobel Prizes. The first time, she was awarded a prize in Physics for her research on radioactivity in 1903. The second time she won the prize in Chemistry for her discovery of the chemical elements polonium and radium. Thus far, the Nobel Prize has gone to a woman just 44 times. In the three scientific categories, that number falls to 16, or less than five percent. Two women have won the Nobel Prize in Physics, and four have won in Chemistry. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has gone to ten women. Famous refusals To date, one winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and one winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature have refused to accept the award. Le Duc Tho rejected the Peace Prize in 1973 because of the then-current situation in Vietnam, while Jean-Paul Sartre, who was awarded the literary accolade in 1964, simply rejected all public honors. In the scientific categories, the Nobel Prize has never been refused. Under Adolf Hitler, however, German scientists were not allowed to accept the prize. The rule affected the winners Richard Kuhn (Chemistry, 1938), Adolf Butenandt (Chemistry, 1939) and Gerhard Domagk (Medicine, 1939). All three accepted the Nobel diploma and medal after the Second World War ended, but they missed out on the prize money. Which nation has been the most successful? The United States has won the most Nobel Prizes in the scientific disciplines: 43 percent of all prize winners for the physics, chemistry and the physiology and medicine categories are Americans. In physics and chemistry, Germany has taken the second most number of prizes. Great Britain ranks third, with the ranking reversed in physiology and medicine. France ranks fourth in all three categories. When are Nobel Prize winners typically born? May 21 and February 28 are the most frequent birthdays for Nobel Prize winners. How old are the winners? The average age of a Nobel Prize winner across all the categories is 59. It's slightly lower in the scientific disciplines. When they accept their prize, chemistry and physics winners have an average age of 57. In medicine, they're only 55 on average. The youngest Nobel Prize winner was physicist Lawrence Bragg. He was 25 years old when he won in 1915. In the scientific categories the oldest winner was the physicist Raymond Davis Jr. When his prize was awarded in 2002, he was 88. Two winners of the Nobel Prize in the economic sciences, Leonid Hurwicz and Lloyd, were even older: 90 and 89 years old respectively.",

"story": "Cheap products come at a price Most products sold in Germany are manufactured in low-wage countries. Conditions down the supply chain often violate international standards, and now critics want EU companies to live up to their responsibilities. In September, a textile factory in Pakistan burnt down killing more than 250 people. The fire was able to spread partly because the security standards were blatantly violated and the emergency exits of the building were blocked or even locked. Shortly after the deadly fire, it surfaced that the factory had been mostly producing items for the German budget clothing store KiK. The case caused uproar in Germany with some observers saying it showed how little German retailers care about the working conditions down their supply chains. KiK reacted by establishing an emergency fund to support the families of the victims with a total of $500,000, and, according to media reports, is considering doubling that amount. Victims need more than emergency aid This help is important, said Sabine Ferenschild of S\u00fcdwind, an organization that is fighting for global social and economic justice. Ferenschild also told DW that this support is by far not enough. \"What's missing is any kind of long-term perspective,\" she said. \"This is what the catastrophes so far have shown. There have been fires in factories before with several workers getting killed.\" The companies had always paid financial support, but over the years that aid stops. \"Those affected though still continue to live with the consequences, for instance when they're unable to work\" or have lost family members who used to contribute to the household's earnings, Ferenschild added. The pressure of the market The companies have to survive on the market and that means they have to keep their costs low and calculate every penny they invest in their products. This usually occurs on the backs of the poorest contributors, the workers in the low-wage countries down the supply chain. \"Whether it's the lack of proper employment contracts, or minimal wages set too low or whether the workers are forced to put in extra hours - those are all structural problems rooted in the tough competition in the clothing retail sector - but that's the same in other sectors as well,\" Ferenschild told DW. There are a number of other organizations in addition to S\u00fcdwind that are fighting to improve the conditions in the supplier companies in developing countries. So far they've had little success. Ferenschild said she believes that this is because so far all agreements have been on a voluntary basis only. The companies thus could change something if they want to - but they don't have to. German companies are not obliged to regularly monitor the companies that work for them abroad, let alone to be transparent about whether they check their suppliers, according to Ferenschild, Berlin is blocking legislation that would require companies to do so. \"The European Commission signaled last year that it is willing to move away from the principle of keeping this on a purely voluntary basis,\" Ferenschild said. That means that the EU wants to introduce obligatory transparency on the issue: Companies would have to inform the public about the conditions under which their products are being produced. Then customers could whether they want to buy an item. Voluntary commitment The German retail sector, however, saw the matter in a different light. Stefan Wengler, of the Foreign Trade Association of German Retail Trade praised the voluntary efforts made by the companies. He told DW that the Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI) has been in place for nine years and pushes for international standards regarding security and pay. About 1,000 companies have agreed to participate in the initiative. Wengler said he sees the project as moving in the right direction. \"At the beginning, in the first year, out of 100 companies only seven passed the test,\" he said, adding that in the most recent check, one third of the companies managed to fulfill the standards and the companies that didn't pass, quickly reacted to fix whatever was wrong. \"The BSCI has very strict standards. The problem is only that when you go into a supplier to check, all might be fine but when you leave it's all back to how it was before again,\" Wengler said. That's why he said he believes it's about making the company heads in the supply countries aware of the problem by training managers and workers. Only if they understood why security standards are so important would things change, Wengler told DW. Responsibility lies with German companies But S\u00fcdwind's Ferenschild was not quite as optimistic. While she said she saw some improvements, she said she also believes there still are massive problems, which are listed on the website of the campaign for social justice. In particular, Ferenschild said, German companies as being responsible. \"Most of the products that are being sold here in Germany are no longer produced here but rather in countries where the workers' rights only exist on paper but not in reality,\" she said. \"It's the German companies who profit from that.\"",

"story": "Prague seeks to calm China over Dalai Lama visit  The Czech president has tried to limit damage to his country's efforts to coax Chinese investment, after the Dalai Lama met with officials. The Tibetan spiritual leader arrived in Prague on Monday. Czech President Milos Zeman, the prime minister and two parliamentary speakers sought to reassure China, after the exilted Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama met with politicians in Prague. In a joint statement on Tuesday, the group said the Czech Republic \"respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity\" of China, adding that: \"we consider the relationships between our countries and their remarkable development in recent years most beneficial for both parties. \"The private activities of some Czech politicians do not signal a change in the Czech Republic's official policy and we would consider it unfortunate if someone perceived them as such,\" said the leaders. The Dalai Lama arrived in Prague on Monday to attend the pro-democracy Forum 2000 conference, co-founded in 1996 by the late Czech president Vaclav Havel, who had close personal links with the Nobel Peace Prize laureate. The 80-year old met politicians from the small centrist Christian and Democratic Union party, the junior partner in the leftist-led coalition government: Deputy Prime Minister Pavel Belobradek, Culture Minister Daniel Herman and the deputy speakers of both houses of parliament. Before coming to Prague, the Dalai Lama met Slovak President Andrej Kiska in Bratislava, a visit that also angered Beijing. Money talks Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Prague with a business delegation in March and subsequently China's CEFC - one of the country's top 10 private firms - recently spent around a billion euros on stakes in a Czech airline, a brewery, two media groups and a top football team. Beijing maintains that the Dalai Lama supports separatism and violence in Tibet, a region China has ruled since 1951. The Dalai Lama fled to India after a failed uprising in 1959, but is still deeply revered by many Tibetans in China and beyond. jbh/jr (AFP, Reuters)",

"story": "German intelligence agency reconsiders surveillance of right-wing 'Reichsb\u00fcrger' Following a rise in prominence of the anti-government 'Reichsb\u00fcrger' movement and the death of a police officer in October, Germany's intelligence agency is believed to be tightening surveillance on the group.  A month after a so-called \"Reichsb\u00fcrger\" fatally shot a policeman near the southwestern city of Nuremberg, Germany's \"Verfassungsschutz\" intelligence agency may be one step closer to tightening surveillance on the right-wing group. This was the latest development on Saturday, according to information presented to the German news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa). In a reply to a question submitted by the Green party, the Interior Ministry said it has asked Germany's intelligence agency to review its previous assessment of the Reichsb\u00fcrger scene. The review has not yet been finalized, however. The Reichsb\u00fcrger movement has gained greater attention since October, after one member in Nuremberg wounded three police officers and killed another in a shootout. Responding to the possibility of stricter surveillance, Green party politician Irene Mihalic on Saturday told dpa: \"This terrible event in Bavaria wasn't necessary to recognize that the Reichsb\u00fcrger are a dangerous right-wing movement.\" Possible police links Spates of Reichsb\u00fcrger-related crimes have continued, with one member on Thursday injuring six officers with pepper spray at his flat in the northwestern town of S\u00f6gel. Authorities estimate the movement has a few hundred members across the country. Last week, in the eastern state of Saxony, State Premier Stanislaw Tillich also confirmed reports of three police officers with \"possible connections to the Reichsb\u00fcrger\" movement. The group rejects the authority of the German Federal Republic, including its laws, borders and institutions. Instead, members believe in the continued existence of the German Reich and its 1937 borders. They refuse to pay taxes, do not comply with regulations and move around using homemade IDs and registration plates. 'Enemy of the constitution' Asked why the group was not under observation, the Interior Ministry reportedly argued as recently as September 2015 that a unified Reichsb\u00fcrger movement did not exist, but instead that it was fragmented. It was decided that activities should be examined case by case. Even earlier, in 2014, the head of the \"Verfassungsschutz,\" Hans-Georg Maa\u00dfen, had warned the internal affairs committee of Germany's lower house of parliament about the \"seriousness of the Reichsb\u00fcrger movement,\" according to dpa. Several individual states have already been surveying the Reichsb\u00fcrger, but each state handles the movement differently. Earlier this week, the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt announced that the Reichsb\u00fcrger group was now considered \"an enemy of the constitution.\" In Hamburg, too, the movement's adherents have been declared anti-constitutional. Further south in Thuringia, the state intelligence agency has so far only kept an eye on groups with links to anti-Semitism or the extreme right-wing scene. However, in light of recent events, a spokeswoman for Thuringia's intelligence agency said it \"seems advisable to extend the scope of observation.\"",

"story": "Arctic ice keeps seeds safe from climate change, catastrophes More than half a million seeds have been put into a deep freeze in Norway to protect them from wars, climate change and unforeseen catastrophes. In its second year of operation, the vaults still have space. The snow cover on the mountainside above the settlement of Longyearbyen, around 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) from the North Pole, melts to a large extent in summer. But much of the earth below remains frozen. The permafrost is one of the main reasons why this spot, 130 meters above sea level, was chosen to house the planet's \"deep freezer\" for crop seeds. In 2008, the bunker in the frosty interior of this Arctic mountain, christened the \"Global Seed Vault,\" initiated by the Norwegian government and now run by the Global Crop Diversity Trust, was officially opened. Since then, more than half a million seed samples have been stored in what the organizers consider to be the \"safest place in the world.\" Though workmen are drilling inside the 100-meter long tunnel, which leads down to the triple-vault, and shifting permafrost has damaged the facility's entrance, there's no danger to the hundreds of thousands of seeds stored inside, according to Roland von Bothmer, a professor of plant breeding and plant genetics at the Swedish University of Agriculture. Safe from catastrophes, wars and climate change The information about the seeds stored here is generally available on the Internet. The seeds themselves remain the property of whichever body has sent them in, normally a national or regional seed bank or agricultural organization. \"They have been dried to just around 5 to 6 percent water content,\" von Bothmer said, holding vacuum-packed seed samples from Denmark and India. \"They are brought here in a 'black box.' We register them and put the box in the seed vault.\" It's important for the vault to protect duplicates, which could be returned to their owners if the originals were to be lost in the event of a disaster, von Bothmer said, pointing out that landslides, earthquakes and civil war could all result in the loss of important crop material. Refrigeration equipment inside the central storage hall works to push the temperature down to -18 degrees Celsius (-0.4 degrees F) - the ideal temperature to preserve the seeds for hundreds of years. Seeds of more than a third of the world's existing varieties of cultivated plants have already been deposited in the vault. \"We have around 520,000 seed samples in this vault,\" von Bothmer said. \"The chamber is not even half full. That means, when we have all three chambers in operation, we can easily store everything we need.\" Noah's Ark for plants But the work carried out by von Bothmer and his colleagues could bear fruit for humanity even without a world-threatening catastrophe. Genetic erosion, the loss of biodiversity in agricultural crops, is already happening at a worrying rate, according to von Bothmer. \"Natural and human selection have been working for 10,000 years and wherever it got adapted, it developed new landraces,\" he said. \"And we lose that variation a lot in the field because farmers in most areas prefer to cultivate modern varieties with a very narrow genetic background.\" He added that the FAO World Food Summit last year said world food production would have to be increased by more than 70 percent by 2050. At the same time, the area available for agriculture is declining. That means we need more efficient and sustainable farming, with plant breeding and plant genetics playing an important role, von Bothmer said. Climate change poses another challenge. \"It will be drier in many areas, there will be more rain in others. There will be a new spectrum of diseases, new pests, all over the world. And we need to have genes that are resistant, for example, in order to cope with these new conditions coming in. Some areas will be winners, others losers. We don\u2019t know where and we don\u2019t know the speed of this.\u201d Author: Irene Quaile Editor: Sean Sinico",

"story": "VW chief lobbyist reinstated following emission tests on animals Volkswagen executive Thomas Steg has returned to his post after an internal audit cleared him of any legal misconduct. Steg had been leave since January after it emerged he failed to prevent emissions tests on animals. German carmaker Volkswagen on Wednesday announced it was reinstating chief lobbyist Thomas Steg, following an internal investigation into a series of emissions tests carried out on animals. In a statement, VW auditors said they found no evidence that Steg had committed any legal misconduct in relation to the tests. Nevertheless, Steg issued an apology Wednesday, saying he regretted not doing more to prevent the experiments on monkeys. \"I was convinced that I acted legally when it came to fulfilling my duties and the terms of my employment,\" Steg said. \"Still, I wonder whether I could have done more back in the Spring of 2013 to prevent these tests.\" Read more: Car exhaust monkey test backfires on VW, German carmakers In January, it emerged that a US research laboratory had placed macaque monkeys in airtight chambers and exposed them to diesel exhaust fumes. The tests, which were carried out in 2014, were commissioned by the European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector (EUGT) \u2014 a now defunct organization founded by German carmakers Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW. The group reportedly wanted to show that diesel emissions were far less dangerous than reported by the World Health Organization, although the results ultimately proved inconclusive. It subsequently emerged that Steg, who before joining VW worked as the German government's deputy spokesman, had known about the experiments back in May 2013 during the planning stages, but failed to prevent them from going ahead. After reports of the tests broke, Steg was placed on a leave of absence \"at his own behest.\" More VW trials under review VW board member Hiltrud Werner welcomed Steg's return, saying it was important that \"employees are fully rehabilitated once a situation such as this is completely resolved and yields a positive result.\" Werner, who oversees corporate integrity and law at the German car giant, added that the board would review all independent trials and research tests involving VW by the second half of the year. Read more: The US market: Volkswagen's Waterloo A day after reports of the animal testing broke, it also emerged that the EUGT had commissioned a trial in Germany where saw 25 people at an Aachen-based university hospital were made to inhale varying amounts of the gas over several hours. According to newspapers, the experiment aimed to test the affects of \"short-term nitrogen dioxide inhalation by healthy people.\" Volkswagen Group continues to maintain almost 1,300 commercial and research partnerships, with more than 100 universities and over 60 institutions in Germany alone. New VW CEO Herbert Diess has vowed to focus future investments into electric vehicles. During last month's annual general meeting, Diess said his aim was for VW to build 3 million electric cars a year by 2025. dm/kms (Reuters, AP, dpa, AFP)",

"story": "No letup in anti-German sentiment in Greece During the debt crisis Greeks have been badmouthing the Germans - but the Germans have been equally critical of their EU counterparts. Some Greeks want this situation to change. German tabloids portray Greeks as bankrupt and tell them to sell off their islands to pay their debts - and Greek cartoonists sketch German chancellor Angela Merkel in a Nazi uniform or as a whip-touting animal tamer at the circus. Negative comments by both Greek and German politicians have also not made rapprochement between the two countries easier. The sour mood is no surprise, and is just one element of the rampant populism in Europe that has only been exacerbated by the crisis, said Mary Giannakaki, deputy leader of the pro-European Democratic Left party, newly elected to the Athens parliament. She said the bleak opinion of the Greeks toward the Germans can only be thought of in a European context. \"The crisis has allowed the specter of nationalism to emerge all across Europe. The idea of 'Europe' is unfairly vilified and demonized,\" Giannakaki, a political scientist who studied in Paris and Athens, said. She said it was clear neither Germany nor Greece was to blame for starting the current economic crisis, but this is something that needed to be explained to the people - and while that is first and foremost the job of the politicians in each country, it has been neglected: \"I really cannot believe that all Greeks think the Germans are enemies and vice-versa. These are minority opinions and isolated cases,\" she said. Another side to the argument was shown in a survey published a few months ago in \"Epikaira,\" a weekly Athens magazine already known for taking swipes at Berlin. Seventy-six percent of respondents said they thought of Germany as a hostile country. Only 1.5 percent had any positive feelings for it. In contrast, six years ago, surveys showed almost 80 percent of Greeks holding Germany in high esteem. Mary Giannakaki is suspicious. \"I read the article and I have to say, the survey's methodology seems quite odd. We don't know even know how the questions were worded.\" She said many respondents apparently confused Germany with the German government or even with Angela Merkel. Giannakaki says she would like to start a comprehensive debate about Europe, giving the Greeks the opportunity to be self-critical. Misunderstandings about Greece's role in a united Europe could also be sorted out, she said. \"Up till now in this country there has never been an in-depth debate about European integration or even a European federation,\" Giannakaki said. \"I'm sorry to say it, but for many Greeks, Europe is nothing more than a jolly mother distributing money and subsidies without seeming to expect anything in return. That's the wrong approach.\" Angelos Koveos, political editor of the Athens newspaper \"To Vima,\" also thinks something needs to be done in Greece. In terms of crisis management, he said, the Greeks have a lot to learn from the Germans. But he's also critical of German politicians and their preachy tone: \"Sometimes attempts are made to impose a moralistic view of the economy on other countries, as if it were a question of blame and punishment,\" Koveos said. He says many people believed that an example was being made of the guilty Greeks. A union of states cannot work in this way, he said: \"And I think all Europeans have made it clear they don't want to work this way.\" Koveos makes an impassioned plea for the misunderstandings between Germans and Greeks to be swept away. He's disappointed with politicians in both countries, because, he says, it appears they only wish to make their mark on the domestic level. To bring about this change, he said, reputable media outlets need to lead the way. \"It's not just the job of the press to describe conflicts, but to also interpret them and, if possible, to identify solutions. Certainly that isn't easy under the present circumstances,\" Koveos said.",

"story": "Indo-Pakistani author Aatish Taseer\u2019s journey to the Islamic world What does it mean to be a Muslim? The question made the British journalist Aatish Taseer undertake a journey through the Islamic world. In his book \u201cStrangers to History\u201d, Aatish Taseer has penned down his experiences on this journey. But it is also about his unusual Indo-Pakistani family history. \"When the past could be seen as a whole, when my father could cast painful bridges over history, I felt a great sympathy as I watched the man I had judged so harshly for not facing his past when it came to me. Muse on the pain of history in this country. And maybe this was all that the Gods had wished me to see, the grimace on my father's face, and for us both in our own ways, strangers to history, to be together on the night when Benazir Bhutto was killed.\" 30 year old Aatish Taseer describes his complicated relationship with his father in his book \"Strangers to History\". Encounter with his father Aatish was born in 1980 in Delhi out of an affair between Salman Taseer, the current governor of Pakistan's Punjab province, and India's renowned journalist Tavleen Singh. After Aatish's birth Salman returned back to Pakistan to his wife and three children. Aatish was brought up by the Sikh family of his mother. In 2005 Aatish, meanwhile a journalist in London, received a letter from his father, in reaction to an article he had written about the 7/7 terrorist attacks. His father accused him of spreading anti-Muslim propaganda and having very superficial knowledge of the Pakistani ethos. \"It was a very strong reaction, very forceful,\" Aatish recalls. \"He as a Muslim was very upset by what I had written and it was interesting to me, because my father was no Muslim at all - by his own admission, he wasn't. And although I wasn't able to formulate it at that point, but the thing that was really at the back of my mind was the question of what despite his lack of faith made him a Muslim.\" His father's stature made the understanding of the historical and political attitudes, as he puts it, all the more important for him. Understanding Islam His quest took him to Iran, Turkey, Syria, Saudi Arabia and finally to Pakistan, where he met his father. For Aatish, it was extremely important to understand Islam, because without the knowledge of it he could not get close to his father. It turned out to be not an easy task. Aatish Taseer went on the pilgrimage to Mecca; in Istanbul, a young theologist explained to him that being a Muslim means to stand above history; and in Syria, he experienced the controversy over the Danish cartoons of the prophet Mohammad. \"Slowly the understanding began to develop of being a cultural Muslim, which I had always taken to be a benign term, a term that I thought it was just adhering to festivals, wearing a certain kind of dress, perhaps liking Urdu poetry,\" he says. \"I didn't think of it as having the kind of meaning that it later showed itself to have; that it was these issues \u2013 this stuff that was contained in cultural Islam \u2013 that were more important than the faith itself.\" Aatish Taseer's book has found a wide global audience and was recently also published in a German translation.

"story": "US rebukes Israel's Netanyahu over 'ethnic cleansing' remark Israel's prime minister has compared Palestinian criticism of settlement activity to \"ethnic cleansing.\" The US has described the premier's language as \"inappropriate and unhelpful,\" saying it undermines peace efforts. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday equated Palestinian criticism of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank to \"ethnic cleansing,\" drawing sharp criticism from Washington, its key ally. In a video disseminated on social media platforms, Netanyahu said he had \"always been perplexed\" by the claim that settlements are an \"obstacle to peace.\" \"The Palestinian leadership actually demands a Palestinian state with one pre-condition: No Jews. There's a phrase for that: It's called ethnic cleansing,\" Netanyahu said. US State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau told reporters on Friday that \"type of terminology is inappropriate and unhelpful.\" \"We obviously strongly disagree with the characterization that those who oppose settlement activity or view it as an obstacle to peace are somehow calling for ethnic cleansing of Jews from the West Bank,\" she added. Trudeau said Israel's expansion policy raised \"real questions about Israel's long-term intentions in the West Bank.\" Last week, the US took a stronger tone on Israeli settlement expansion after a military committee approved hundreds of complexes in the West Bank, which the Palestinians hope will form part of an independent state. The international community maintains that settlement activity in the West Bank is illegal and counter to peace efforts aimed at ending the conflict. However, the Israeli government rejects such claims, saying Jews have lived in the territory for thousands of years and that settlements do not undermine a peaceful resolution. ls/cmk (Reuters, AP)",

"story": "Mexico's murder rate rises to 20,000 in ten months; worst in 20 years A human rights ombudsman, a media executive and two men in a bitter union dispute are just the latest victims of Mexico's rising murder rate. October was the worst month for murder in 20 years.  Silvestre de la Toba Camacho was driving with his wife and two children in Baja California Sur on Monday night when a vehicle pulled alongside and gunmen began firing. De la Toba Camacho and his son died at the scene, his wife and 18-year-old daughter were wounded. Human Rights Commission director in the state of Baja California Sur since 2015, and a former deputy in the State Congress, de la Toba Camacho and his son added to the record statistics in Mexico for murder. In the first ten months of the year, 20,878 murder investigations have been opened, according to the Interior Ministry. That is more than the 20,547 murders reported for the whole of 2016. The unsolved crime rate in Mexico rose to 96 percent earlier this year. The Canadian Embassy in Mexico was among those to condemn the killing: Vice president of the Televisa media giant, Adolfo Lagos Espinosa, was bicycling in a rural area near the ancient pyramids of Teotihuacan close to the capital on Sunday when a gunfight broke out between two assailants and two of Espinosa's bodyguards. He died in the attack. Deadliest year since records began Nationwide, 2017 is on track to be the deadliest year since the government began collecting this data in 1997. On average, 69 murders are committed every day in Mexico \u2014 an increase from the average of 63 per day six years ago. While the country's rampant illegal drug trade and criminal gangs are at the center of the murders, other causes contribute. A bitter union dispute at a Canadian-owned gold mine in southern Mexico, along with a dispute between two vigilante groups have left state prosecutors unclear on the motives for two killings in the area over the weekend. El Limon Guajes mine has been closed by road blockades since the start of the month. Some reports suggest gunmen drove up to one of the barriers and opened fire. But on Wednesday, the state prosecutor's office suggested the deaths may have resulted from a dispute between two vigilante groups in the Guerrero Gold Belt, 180 kilometers (112 miles) southwest of Mexico City. The most violent state in Mexico Guerrero, which includes the resort city of Acapulco, has become the country's most violent state. In 2014, 43 teaching students disappeared and were presumed murdered after the intervention of police officers and the local mayor. In October, political and social leader Ranferi Hernandez Acevedo, his wife, mother-in-law and chauffeur were reported missing before their remains were recovered from a burning vehicle on a rural state highway. The Mexican war against drug criminals began in 2006 when President Felipe Calderon said his government and security forces would fix drug trafficking and drug-related violence. Instead, nearly ten years later 150,000 people have died and at least 28,000 people have disappeared. President's reputation undermined Current President Enrique Pena Nieto admitted earlier this year that: \"Confrontations between members of different armed groups have really become an everyday scenario in many parts of the country.\" Pena Nieto's political reputation was undermined in the wake of the 2014 disappearances of the Guerrero students and he risks ending his six-year term as one of the least popular presidents of the last 20 years. According to a poll in June, 60 percent of respondents blamed his administration for the rise in violence. Only 3 percent believed him to be trustworthy. jm/se (EFE, Reuters)",

"story": "Opinion: A Bigger, Not Better, NATO A year ago NATO underwent the largest expansion in the organization's history, when on March 29, seven eastern and south-eastern European countries joined the alliance. NATO may have grown in size, but not in importance. The expansion was a big step for NATO -- largely because, with the three Baltic countries, the first successor states of the Soviet Union, the erstwhile superpower which was the impetus for NATO's establishment to start with. Fear of Moscow was the main reason for Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to enter the alliance's protective screen. But, keeping things in perspective, Russia isn't a threat to its western neighbors. For years it's been a guest at NATO's table; it even has a say in a broad range of matters. NATO expansion was certainly an important symbol that the Cold War chapter is really closed -- but just one of many. New chapters in world history already started long ago: southeastern Europe has clearly put the era of war behind it, but it still suffers from the consequences. From Bosnia and Herzegovina to Serbia-Montenegro and Kosovo to Macedonia, a number of more or less unstable states stretches through the region, keeping Europe's security architects holding their breath. And even if NATO's intervention in the Kosovo War was on the margins of legality according to international law, all things considered, the alliance played a positive role in the region's stabilization. But today's overriding task -- the fight against international terrorism -- hasn't yet reached such a conclusion. The United States, with the help of its NATO partners, did indeed put an end to the Taliban's reign of terror in Afghanistan and, at the same time, significantly weakened an important al Qaeda base. However, despite the alliance's presence, the country is far from being either stable or a functioning democracy. And terrorist leader Osama bin Laden is still at large; his network continues to operate, as the terrible attacks in Madrid last year showed. There's also the large-scale anti-terror project \"Enduring Freedom,\" which is meant to ensure security in the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf states. Here, too, substantial NATO contingents are in action, but there still aren't any measurable results. NATO suffered the biggest set-back, however, with the Iraq War. The alliance split over whether the body of evidence against Saddam Hussein was sufficient to justify military intervention. And although the fissure between the war coalition partners and the war's opponents has been passably cemented together, the United States no longer sees NATO as a hard and fast alliance but as a list of potential partners. That also has to do with the fact that many European countries -- and especially the new members -- use NATO as a guarantee of protection but contribute very little to it. For, the United States is militarily still stronger than all the other alliance members put together. All of Washington's appeals to the Europeans to increase their military expenditures have so far been in vain. Despite last year's expansion, NATO risks degenerating into a transatlantic talking shop. In that respect, the idea of intervention troops that can be quickly deployed, which NATO is now pursuing, hasn't changed much, since that is not where the problems in cooperating lay. Alliance or not, national intelligence agencies don't work closely enough together. Although the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks caused NATO partners to close ranks, petty jealousy and mistrust continue to hamper the exchange of information. But close cooperation of the part of intelligence agencies is indispensable to prevent terror. And it could give NATO as an alliance a new and, above all, forward-looking course.",

"story": "Keita and Cisse face off in Mali presidential election runoff Two candidates made large gains in Mali's July 28 polls, but neither has won a majority. Polls have now reopened in a runoff vote that Malians hope will produce a president who can lead the country away from turmoil. The ballot in Sunday's presidential election sharply reduces voters' choice from the original 27 candidates to only two frontrunners: former Prime Minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita (pictured above, left), and former Finance Minister, Soumaila Cisse (pictured above, right). Ex-Prime Minister Keita is favored to win in the runoff vote on Sunday. Not only did he capture roughly 40 percent of the vote late last month, but he has also gained the backing of Mali's religious leaders and military. In the days leading up to the final stage of the election, Keita pledged to move the country toward a peaceful resolution with separatist groups in the country's north. \"My first priority would be the reconciliation of the country ... after the trauma that it has suffered, a new start is needed,\" Keita told supporters at a speech last week, adding that they should give him a \"clear and clean majority.\" Although Mali's largest political party, ADEMA, has endorsed Cisse, the former finance minister won only 20 percent of the vote in the late-July election. However, he expressed confidence in his chances to win the presidency while speaking to the news agency AFP. \"It is not about adding to the votes from the first round. There will be new votes, it is a new election. Everything restarts from zero,\" Cisse told AFP. Voters hope the country's new president can help restabilize the government and protect them from further violence from northern separatists. An interim government and 12,600-strong UN peacekeeping mission now oversee the country. Unrest began in early 2012 with a military coup which led to the ouster of then President Amadou Toumani Toure. The weakened state allowed the Tuareg separatist National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) to gain control in the country's north. Al Qaeda-linked Islamist groups helping the ethnic separatist group gradually exercised their own influence over the region and imposed an extreme version of Islamic law. In January, the government in Bamako asked France to lead a military intervention to halt a rebel-led march toward the capital city. Thousands more troops, mainly from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) joined the effort. The UN deployed a 12,600 peacekeeping force to Mali at the beginning of July. A successful vote on Sunday should allow the new government to unlock 4 billion euros ($5.34 billion) needed to help re-stabilize Mali. Mali wants a strong leader Keita has run on the campaign slogan of returning honor to Mali. His popularity stems from his reputation as a firm leader who has political experience as a prime minister, finance minister and speaker of the National Assembly. \"He has this reputation as somebody who is strict. He doesn't shy away from a fight,\" Mali expert Bruce Whitehouse, who teaches at the Lehigh University in the US state of Pennsylvania, told the Associate Press news agency. \"He's this sort of old-school politician who knows how to get things done, and knows how to build alliances. I don't think anybody sees him as any kind of visionary or innovator but he may just be the sort of man who can hold things together in some basic way,\" said Whitehouse. Both Keita and Cisse ran against the last president, Amadou Toumani Toure, in 2002. Five years later, Keita attempted to oust the incumbent president again, but only gained 19 percent of the vote. The latest delay in forming a government signals hope for the country's future, according to a Malian journalist. \"The fact that there's a runoff vote is a victory for democracy in Mali,\" the journalist Ramata Diaore told the news agency DPA. \"It shows that religious leaders and the armed forces ... didn't succeed in pushing through their preferred candidate, Keita. Now everything is up in the air,\" Diaore said. The new president will face the task of reaching an agreement with the MLNA and allied groups in the north who want autonomy from Bamako. Earlier this week, the MLNA signed an agreement with Tuareg and related umbrella groups to work together for more independence from the Malian government. kms/lw (AP, AFP, Reuters, dpa)",

"story": "Costs of cleaning old Sellafield nuclear site soar The British government has been forced to admit that it doesn't know the ultimate cost of closing down and cleaning up its hazardous nuclear site Sellafield. The latest figure was 53 billion pounds. The cost estimate of cleaning up the hazardous waste at Sellafield reached 53 billion pounds ($79.18 billion, 74 billion euros) in February, a new National Audit Office report said. That estimate is up 5 billion pounds from March last year, and the figure is expected to rise above 70 billion pounds. Last year, Britain's Committee of Public Accounts criticized the management of Sellafield for huge cost over-runs, delays on projects and expensive staff. The committee, which assesses whether taxpayers' money is being spent properly, on Wednesday asked the government, the site's owner, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), Sellafield Ltd and former managers Nuclear Management Partners (NMP) whether costs would continue to rise. The NDA is aiming to clear Sellafield, called Britain's \"largest and most hazardous nuclear site\" by the NAO, by 2120. 'Unprecedented difficulties' \"It is impossible to know that (...) we find difficulties at the site which are pretty much unprecedented,\" Stephen Lovegrove, permanent secretary at the government's Department of Energy and Climate Change, told the committee. Britain's worst ever nuclear accident happened at the site in 1957. Sellafield stopped generating electricity in 2003. It is now a reprocessing and waste storage facility which deals with spent nuclear fuel from Britain and other countries. Despite the dangers of nuclear power - illustrated by the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011- the EU in September recommended approval of Britain's ambitious plan to build its first nuclear plant in a generation - the Hinkley Point project - with backing from French and Chinese energy giants, after ruling that it met state aid rules. bk/hg (Reuters, AFP)",

"story": "Peru earthquake: Casualties reported after powerful quake hits south coast  A strong earthquake has struck off the coast of southern Peru, killing at least one person and injuring more than 60. The jolt damaged roads and homes, and authorities warned the death toll could rise.  The 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit Sunday at 4:18 a.m. local time (0918 UTC) in the Pacific Ocean, 40 kilometers (25 miles) offshore from the town of Acari in Peru's Arequipa region, the US Geological Survey reported. Peru's Geophysics Institute said it had measured a magnitude of 6.8. Read more: Magnitude 7.6 earthquake hits coast of southern Chile The powerful tremor caused 171 homes to collapse, displacing the same number of families, Peru's National Emergency Operations Center said on its website. At least 736 families had been affected in some way by the tremor, they added. Roads also collapsed and left several municipalities without power. Officials said the only confirmed fatality was a 55-year-old man, who died in the town of Yauca after being crushed by rocks. Read more: Waterfalls dry up after Mexico quakes Peru's Civil Defense Institute (INDECI), which is coordinating emergency help, said 65 people were injured. Many of those injured were in Caraveli province, a coastal area dependent on fishing and mining that is popular with tourists, officials said. INDECI chief Jorge Chavez said damage to roads was hampering efforts to reach the worst-affected areas. Workers used large tractors to clear away boulders and debris that crashed down and blocked some roads. Aid for victims President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski traveled to the towns of Chala and Acari, where he said the quake had toppled around 100 houses. \"We are going to send everything that is needed, such as tents for people whose homes were destroyed,\" Kuczynski told reporters. The US Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially warned that \"hazardous tsunami waves are forecast for some coasts\" and that large swells could hit Peru and Chile. But it later downgraded the threat and said no tsunami waves had been spotted. Earthquakes are fairly common in Peru, which is on the so-called \"Ring of Fire\" \u2014 an arc of fault lines that circles the Pacific Basin. A 2007 quake in the country's southern Ica district killed 595 people. In November 2015, two major 7.6 magnitude earthquakes hit eastern Peru near the border with Brazil. The tremor comes as Pope Francis prepares to visit Chile and Peru from January 15-21. Some damage occurred in communities that Pope Francis was scheduled to visit this week, but officials said the damage would not change the pontiff's tour. law,nm/ng (Reuters, AP, EFE, dpa)",

"story": "El-Sonni: Stable Libya 'five to 10 years' away With three rival governments and the reluctant host to thousands of migrants making their way to Europe, Libya is in chaos. Will it ever unite for democracy? Taher El-Sonni meets Tim Sebastian on Conflict Zone. \"It is something that [a government cannot] easily handle on its own, even if we are united. It needs support from all over,\" El-Sonni told Conflict Zone, regarding his country's many troubles. Six years on from the revolution that overthrew the decades-long dictatorship of Colonel Gaddafi, Libya's problems can hardly be overstated: with no legitimate central government, violence common and terrorism a continual threat, the conclusion of many - including in recent months France\u2019s Foreign Minister - is that Libya is a failed state. One million people in waiting On top of all this, the main route for African migrants heading to Europe is through Libya. \"The situation of migrants crossing Libya was appalling during Gaddafi's era, but it has become diabolical since,\" said Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, in September. While stating his desire to establish centers to process migrants in Libya before people took \"crazy risks when they are not all eligible for asylum\", Emmanuel Macron in July put the number waiting to cross the Mediterranean there at between 800,000 and 1 million people. For those that did manage to set off from Libya's coast, their treatment at the hands of the country's coastguard also came under fire from Al Hussein: \"Like the militias onshore, [they] also sometimes beat, rob and even shoot the migrants they intercept.\" Was this a situation El-Sonni \u2013 who worked for the UN for 17 years, specializing in crisis management \u2013 recognized? \"We don't shoot migrants. What we're doing is trying to apply our sovereign rules and regulations and by saving their lives and bringing them back. This is an international agreement. This is an EU-Libya agreement.\" The EU's SOPHIA military operation, which involves the Libyan navy and coastguard, aims to \"identify, capture and dispose of vessels and enabling assets used or suspected of being used by migrant smugglers or traffickers\" in the Southern Central Mediterranean. The EU says SOPHIA has saved 40,000 lives off the coast of Libya since it began in June 2015. But there is grave concern too from the UN and NGOs for the lives of those thousands of migrants stranded in Libya. Dr Joanne Liu, International President of Medecins Sans Frontieres, also in September wrote that the \"detention of migrants and refugees in Libya is rotten to the core. It must be named for what it is: a thriving enterprise of kidnapping, torture and extortion.\" \"Human rights abuse is something that we don't accept,\" said El Sonni. \"We have our minister of interior working on it. We have our civil society working and supporting it. We allow all international organizations to work and support in these detention centers ... But, what I'm telling you, it's a massive thing that even European countries who are steady states could not fix.\" An honest assessment of Libya? So when could Libyans expect a steady state? How many more years would chaos prevail in the country? \"I think five to 10 years, in order for us to have a steady state and a stable state, to be realistic,\" El-Sonni told Tim Sebastian. But had he already been overly optimistic in his prognosis of Libya? Speaking in April 2016, El-Sonni said the Government of National Accord (GNA) \u2013 to whose Prime Minister, Fayez Sarraj, he is chief advisor \u2013 had \"control of the state institutions\" and that their opponents \"understand the game is over.\" Didn\u2019t Libyans deserve a more honest assessment of what is going on? \"We were fair and we are fair,\" El-Sonni told DW. \"You can see how things are shaping up much better; embassies coming back to Tripoli, the United Nations is coming back next month. These are good signs.\" 'A new phase'? Nevertheless, confidence in Libya's political institutions remains at rock bottom. Polls reported by the Libya Herald on 18 October showed 91% of people believed the government had failed to deliver on the aims of the revolution. Perhaps more critical still, 92% thought that corruption had become even worse since the fall of Gaddafi. \"When there is a centralized dictatorship, centralized on a person and without proper institutions [that] collapse all of a sudden, with weapons spread around, this is the typical result you get,\" said El-Sonni. \"The political awareness of the people is minimum because they never got a chance to even be vocal about what they want and to express themselves. This is a new phase in Libya.\" While insisting that security was \"not worse\" than 2014 when elections did take place, Prime Minister Sarraj's right-hand man accepted elections could still bring more factionalism, but said they were \"something that we have to go through. There is no guarantee.\" \"In order to achieve a democracy, you need more democracy,\" El-Sonni told Conflict Zone, summing up the difficulty for Libya of reaching that goal. Despite the country's myriad problems, the recent polls also showed a high level of hopefulness \u2013 44% say they are \"very optimistic\" about its future.",

"story": "Obama announces deployment of 300 troops to Cameroon US President Barack Obama has said he will send troops to Cameroon in order to counter the terror group Boko Haram. The central African country was the target of an attack this past weekend. President Obama informed Congress on Wednesday it was sending 300 soldiers to Cameroon as part of the fight against the terrorist organization Boko Haram. The White House said 90 troops had already been deployed to the central African nation. The force, which officials say is armed for self defense, will remain in the country until their presence is no longer needed. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the deployment was in coordination with the Cameroon government. \"It will be part of a broader regional effort to stop the spread of Boko Haram and other violent extremist organizations in West Africa,\" he said. Boko Haram, a Nigeria-based militant group affiliated with the \"Islamic State\" terrorist organization, began stepping up attacks in Cameroon earlier this year. A report released by Amnesty International in September said that almost 400 people in Cameroon had been killed by Boko Haram fighters since January 2015. On Sunday, a sucide attack killed nine people and injured 29 in a northern part of the country. blc/msh (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)",

"story": "Air India to cut cost amid industry turbulence The Indian airliner has announced plans to slash staff and cut costly routes amid increasing pressure from cut-rate competitors. The move comes as the company eyes a possible turn-around after a long spell of losses. India's state-owned aviation giant Air India announced late on Sunday that it plans to cut costs by 14 billion rupees (195 million euros, $227 million), or about 6 percent of its total outlays, in the next financial year. The announcement comes after the government asked the loss-making carrier to improve its fiscal health. The airline said that it would identify \"surplus staff,\" freeze contractual hiring and discontinue loss-making routes, in a move meant to reduce its variable spending of 140 billion rupees by a tenth. \"The ministry of civil aviation has directed that a 10 percent cut must be imposed,\" the company's chairman and managing director Robit Nandan said in a circular to senior staff. The company has also restricted staff travel, while pilots and cabin crew must stay in hotels near airports to cut transport costs. In addition, the circular said, \"wage increases for local staff... will not be entertained.\" Stiff competition The move comes as Air India faces cut-throat competition from cheaper, private-sector rivals. The country's former aviation monopoly now controls just a fifth of the domestic market and hasn't turned an annual profit since 2007. In 2012, the government handed the flat-lining carrier a 300-billion-rupee bailout package, which was to be administered over a nine-year period, despite opposition from several ministers. The state run airline has reduced its losses over the last two fiscal years, with total year-on-year revenue rising by 6.5 percent in December 2014. All but one of India's major carriers have seen earnings nosedive, due to high operation costs and some of the lowest fare prices in the world. pad/uhe (AFP, PTI, Reuters)",

"story": "New Italian Law Grants Immunity to Premier Berlusconi Italy's lower house of parliament has passed a bill that will grant immunity to Premier Silvio Berlusconi, who has had his share of run-ins with the law over corruption allegations in connection with his media empire. The bill got 309 yes votes from lawmakers, with 236 opposed and 30 abstentions. The adoption of the new law is a victory for Berlusconi, who began his third round as prime minister in April. The bill gives legal immunity from prosecution to the president, prime minister and the speakers of the two chambers of parliament while in office, and is now expected to become law in record time when it advances to the Senate in late July. Judges and much of Italy's left-wing opposition opposed the law, which will suspend any statute of limitations to a case until the defendant leaves office. Italian Justice Minister Angelino Alfano said that the bill was a \"response to the need of those in the highest positions of state to work in serenity.\" Opposition leader Walter Veltroni, whose Democratic Party voted against the bill, commented last month that \"Berlusconi is in a big hurry on these matters,\" while the billionaire's lawyer Niccolo Ghedini said the prime minister was \"under constant attacks by judges.\" Long list of allegations Berlusconi, a self-made billionaire, has faced charges including corruption, tax fraud, false accounting and illegally financing political parties, but he has never been definitively convicted. On Friday parliamentarians will also vote on a bill to suspend thousands of trials for a year as a means of speeding Italy's notoriously slow justice system for the most serious cases languishing on the books. That law would keep the media tycoon out of the dock this month in a trial on charges of giving $600,000 dollars (380,000 euros) to his British lawyer David Mills in exchange for giving false testimony. Berlusconi is also seeking strict curbs on the use of wiretaps in judicial investigations and stiffer penalties for the publication of their transcripts.",

"story": "Anger, dismay and cynicism: The Muslim world responds to the new Charlie Hebdo The latest edition of Charlie Hebdo has sparked heated debate in the Muslim world. The main media outlets have been restrained in their response, but discussions on social media are incensed. You won't find Muhammad anywhere in the Arab world right now. Not, that is, in caricature - the weeping prophet the satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo portrayed on its cover one week after the deadly attacks in Paris. The prophet is weeping over the violence perpetrated in the supposed name of Islam. But readers of the major Arab papers can't see him, because not one of those papers has published the cartoon. The majority in Algeria, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia decided to confine their reporting on the new edition to the sidelines - if, that is, they covered it at all. Some newspapers published caricatures of their own today that expressed their positions on the issue. These are considerably at variance. The Tunisian paper Al Fair, for example, offered its readers a drawing of a jihadist lighting a bomb. The bomb is round and depicts a globe. The jihadist is sitting on it - the message is that Islamist terrorists are destroying the world in which they themselves live. The Algerian paper Al Joumhouria published a very different caricature: a drawing of a larger-than-life Jew holding a tiny Muslim doll under a terrified woman's nose. It's strongly reminiscent of the anti-Semitic drawings that circulated in Germany under the Nazis. One week after the attacks, which were perpetrated by men of Algerian origin, this caricature conveys the message that the true enemies of humanity are the Jews. Justified dismay The young, liberal online newspaper Al Arabi al-Jadeed in London, on the other hand, carries extensive coverage of the caricatures. Commentator Azmi Bishara writes that the lines between free speech and hate speech have been blurred - but that this line \"is not so thin, and a sound mind can indeed tell the difference.\" He says \"it is time to ask ourselves, can cartoons that insult the prophets of all religions, including the prophet of Islam, truly undermine the stature of these prophets? [\u2026] Are such events a worthy cause for millions of people to rise up and damage their future, their plans, their relations with other nations and peoples?\" Angry voices Many people writing online say yes to that, with comments on Twitter expressing anger and even cynicism. One user writes that Charlie Hebdo is spitting into Muslims' faces once again. \"We will avenge our leader Muhammad for you,\" writes another user from East Asia. People who don't entirely condemn the attacks have also been writing in to Al Jazeera. One reader asks what it means that Charlie Hebdo wants to \"forgive,\" as indicated in the cartoon. \"The attackers are dead, so it's not really a question of forgiveness anymore,\" she says. Another refers to the limits of freedom: \"Islam is a peaceful religion. Making fun of or insulting other people's faith is not freedom of speech - that's hate speech.\" Others focus on the political background to the attacks. \"The principal cause is the weakness of Muslim states, their corrupt, weak and traitorous ruling dynasties,\" writes one commentator, and adds that it is obvious what should be done about it: \"They must be removed by good Muslims.\" The Egyptian fatwa office The Dar al-Iftaa, the Egyptian fatwa office, had already commented in advance of today's edition of Charlie Hebdo, describing it as \"an unjustified provocation to the feelings of 1.5 billion Muslims around the world.\" As Dar al-Iftaa had it, \"Charlie Hebdo's next edition will stir a new wave of hatred in the French and western (Muslim) community in general.\" It added that \"the magazine's actions hinder Muslims' endeavors to achieve coexistence and dialog among civilizations.\" A week ago Dar al-Iftaa immediately issued a condemnation of the Paris attacks. Now, though, the office has criticized the new drawings. \"This is considered a dangerous escalation in the face of human values, liberations, cultural diversity, tolerance and respect to human rights which are very vital to maintain societal peace,\" it writes: \"Furthermore, it deepens the sentiments of hatred and discrimination in the hearts of Muslims and non-Muslims alike.\"",

"story": "DW's Health News: What does stress do to our eyes? Did you know that stress can damage your eyesight? Or that the so-called good cholesterol isn't that great after all? DW brings you this week's health news, all in one handy guide! Stress can damage eyesight Our eyes have to cope with a lot throughout the day \u2013 with flickering computer screens, glaring fluorescent lights, or dirt and pollen flying through the air. But it's not only our environment that can damage the eyes, they can also be impacted from the inside. A new study by researchers at Magdeburg University in Germany has revealed that mental stress and anxiety can result in a loss of vision. Continuous mental strain raises levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which impacts our nervous system and therefore our brain and eyes. This can lead to severe eye diseases, such as glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration and optic neuropathy, say the researchers. The researchers emphasize that it is important to realize that stress is not only a consequence of vision loss, but also a cause, which has to be taken seriously. So, be kind to your eyes and body, give yourself a break once in a while and try to relax. Mindfulness training, such as yoga and meditation can help after a long day's work. Is good cholesterol bad for the heart? Cholesterol levels are usually measured in \"good\u201d cholesterol, namely HDL-cholesterol and \"bad\u201d cholesterol called LDL-cholesterol. When people speak about high cholesterol levels, they are usually referring to LDL-cholesterol, which can cause arteriosclerosis and heighten the risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attack and stroke. HDL-cholesterol has always been seen as a vital part of cell membranes and cellular processes, but recently researchers in Japan discovered that it too can increase the risk for cardiovascular diseases, but only at high levels. For 12 years, they studied more than 43,000 people aged between 40 and 89 years. They discovered that people with HDL-cholesterol levels over 90 mg/dl had a 2.4 times higher risk of dying of arteriosclerosis as people with normal HDL-cholesterol levels (40-59 mg/dl). Interestingly, the researchers also saw that extremely high HDL-cholesterol levels were more dangerous for people who frequently drank alcohol. Discovery of new antibiotic against MRSA Multi-resistant bacteria have become a looming problem in hospitals today. The overuse of antibiotics has resulted in resistant bacteria that cannot be killed. The hospital superbug Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, known as MRSA, is one of them. It can trigger severe infections in humans and can even result in death. MRSA is extremely hard to treat because it has become resistant to several common antibiotics. Now researchers at the Technical University in Berlin have discovered a new type of antibiotic that might be able to fight this multi-resistant germ. The research team isolated a bioactive molecule from cultures of Microbacterium aborescens, which they called Microvionin. It belongs to the group of lipopeptide-antibiotics. In future, the researchers are hoping that they can use Microvionin to produce a suitable medication against MRSA and reduce the amount of infections in hospitals.",

"story": "Peru's ex-president Fujimori receives medical pardon Peru's president has pardoned jailed former president Alberto Fujimori after he was hospitalized. The 79-year-old was serving 25 years for rights abuses and corruption. Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski announced Sunday that he granted a medical pardon to jailed ex-president Alberto Fujimori for \"humanitarian reasons.\" Fujimori was hospitalized on Saturday, prompting rumors that he could be handed a medical pardon. Fujimori's doctor said Peru's polarizing figure was transferred to Lima's Centenary Clinic after a \"sudden drop in [blood] pressure with marked arrhythmia.\" The transfer came after his daughter, Keiki Fujimori, who leads the opposition Fujimorist Popular Front party, failed in Congress last Thursday to amass enough votes to impeach Kuczynski. Nine opposition members, including the ex-president's youngest son Kenji, abstained in that vote, allowing Kuczynski to dodge censure. Political analysts questioned whether Fujimori's pardon could be a way for Kuczynski to pay off his political debt to Kenji Fujimori. Loathed and lauded Some Peruvians laud the former strongman, who governed Peru from 1990 to 2000, for defeating the Maoist Shining Path guerrillas and stabilizing Peru's economy. Other Peruvians loathe him for human rights violations carried out under his governance. Peruvian law provides that no person convicted of murder or kidnapping can receive a presidential pardon unless in the case of a terminal illness. In a statement Sunday, Kuczynski said a medical board had determined Fujimori \"suffers from a progressive, degenerative and incurable disease and that prison conditions mean a serious risk to his life, health and well-being.\" Three previous requests from Fujimori for pardons since 2013 were rejected after doctors said he did not suffer from incurable illness or severe mental disorder. cw, ipj/aw (AP, AFP)",

"story": "India hands out life sentences for deadly Gujarat riots Nearly a dozen people have been sentenced to life in prison for their involvement in deadly sectarian riots. But the Indian government has also cracked down on an NGO critical of Modi's involvement in the violence. An Indian court on Friday sentenced 11 people to life in prison for participating in deadly sectarian riots that swept across the state of Gujarat in 2002, leaving over 1,000 dead in its wake. At least 12 more defendants received seven years in prison, while one received a 10-year sentence. \"This is hardly the punishment for the crime they have committed,\" said Zakia Jafri, the widow of the opposition Congress party lawmaker Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the riots. Indian activist Anand Yagnik said the guilty should have received the death penalty. However, Special Court Judge P.B. Desai rejected the demand, saying the prosecution failed to prove accusations of a criminal conspiracy. The case has plagued Prime Minister Narendra Modi's political career since he served as the state's chief minister at the time of the riots. Activists claim Modi did little to prevent the violence that ensued, while others allege he instigated it. Earlier this month, a court convicted 24 Hindus and acquitted 36 others over the Gulbarg Housing Society massacre, in which a Hindu mob in 2002 set fire to residences and attacked inhabitants of the predominantly Muslim complex. 'Actions of a bully' Meanwhile, the Indian government on Thursday revoked the Sabrang Trust's foreign funding license, citing multiple violations of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), including misuse of foreign funds. The non-profit is run by high-profile activist Teesta Setalvad, a staunch critic of Modi who has brought attention to his involvement in the 2002 riots. \"Never be scared of the actions of a bully who only knows the use of brute force. Right shall triumph,\" Setalvad said in a statement posted on Twitter. UN human rights experts on Thursday called on the government to repeal the FCRA. \"We are alarmed that FCRA provisions are being used more and more to silence organizations involved in advocating civil, political, economic, social, environmental or cultural priorities, which may differ from those backed by the government,\" the UN Special Rapporteurs said in a statement. ls/kl (AFP, AP, Reuters)",

"story": "Eurozone jobs crisis far from bottoming out Unemployment in the eurozone has reached a new all-time high, surpassing the 19-million mark for the first time since the euro was launched. As growth won't pick up this year, Europe's jobs crisis is expected to worsen. Unemployment across the 17-nation eurozone has struck 12 percent for the first time since the introduction of the euro in 1999, the European Union's statistics office, Eurostat, said on Tuesday. As 33,000 Europeans joined the jobless queues in February, the number of jobless in the single currency area surpassed 19 million people, or two million more than in the same month a year ago, Eurostat data showed. For the wider 27-nation European Union, February jobs data also showed a significant increase by 76,000 people to 26.34 million - a month-on-month rise in the rate from 10.8 percent in January to 10.9 percent in February. Describing unemployment as unacceptably high, EU Employment Commissioner Laszlo Andor said the European Union needed to mobilize all available resources to create jobs, most notably for young people. Youth unemployment stood at 23.9 percent in the eurozone and at 23.5 percent in the EU, Eurostat's data showed, with crisis-hit Spain and Greece suffering jobless rates of more than 55 percent among youngsters under 25 years of age, followed by Portugal and Italy in the range of more than 35 percent. Greece and Spain are also leaders with regard to total unemployment figures, with rates of 26.4 percent and 26.3 percent respectively. #video#However, the February figures were compiled before the outbreak of the debt crisis in Cyprus. Many economists believe Cyprus' unemployment, which currently stands at 14 percent, will rise to Greek and Spanish levels as the country's economy is expected to shrink by 10 percent this year. In addition, economic contraction in the eurozone is far from bottoming out as output is forecast to shrink by another 0.3 percent this year. Austria and Germany, which have been faring relatively well in the current economic crisis, had the lowest unemployment rate in the eurozone with 4.8 percent and 5.4 percent respectively in February. uhe/pfd (AP, AFP, dpa)",

"story": "Economic summit places euro recovery at heart of Greek bailout At the Munich Economic Summit, the head of the ECB called for a strong sense of direction to lead Europe out of dire financial straits due to debt trouble in Greece. The head of the European Central Bank (ECB), Jean-Claude Trichet, said the key to sparing other European nations from further collateral damage from Greece's financial troubles is getting a rescue package to Athens as soon as possible. \"What we need most at this time is a strong sense of direction,\" said Trichet in a speech at the Munich Economic Summit on Thursday. \"We need a sense of direction that can guide us on how we can emerge from these turbulent events and how we can return to the path of economic stability.\" Trichet added that returning stability to Greece depended on three steps. The first is the ongoing meetings in Athens between the Greek government, the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the ECB. The goal of the meetings is to come up with a concrete plan for Greece to rein in its spending to help get its debt under control. The second step toward regaining financial stability in the eurozone and in Greece is a financial aid package of 45 billion euros ($60 billion) for Athens that is currently under debate in the German government. Germany is being asked to contribute 8.4 billion euros. Finally, Trichet called for \"a giant step forward in our own framework of surveillance, peer pressure and policy adjustment within the [European] monetary union.\" He added that he hoped Germany would play a leading role in policy surveillance and adjustment. 'Help to help themselves' German President Horst Koehler also spoke at the Munich summit, and echoed Trichet's sentiment that a financial lifeline should be thrown to Greece. \"Greece must take responsibility,\" said Koehler, referring to the ongoing negotiations to reduce the country's spending. \"But it's understandable if they expect help so they can help themselves. Germany should, in its own interest, do its part to contribute to stability.\" Many German politicians, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, cite protection of the euro as the main reason for contributing to a bailout for Greece. Koehler added his support for Europe's common currency. \"So far, the euro has served Europe well,\" he said. \"As long as we don't make any serious mistakes, it will continue to serve Europe well and provide an anchor of stability in the world monetary system.\" Regain the upper hand Regarding future financial policy in Germany and Europe, Koehler advocated tougher rules and more transparency in the banking sector. \"Government must win back the upper hand over the financial market,\" he said. \"Too much room with no rules was given to the interests of protagonists in the financial market. That's one of the reasons the financial crisis was able to happen in the first place. It also led to a situation where the government was backed into a corner during the crisis, and that must not be allowed to happen again.\" Koehler said banks and financial institutions can no longer become too big to fail, and should have enough capital on hand to cover all kinds of investments, including hedge funds. He also called for an end to the existence of \"shadow banking entities.\" mz/AFP/Reuters Editor: Susan Houlton",

"story": "Impasse at US-Germany 'no-spying' talks? Two senior German politicians have urged the United States to concede to Germany's quest for a \"no-spying\" pact, with one warning that Berlin could consider sanctions against US firms operating in Germany. German media reports of an impasse at US-German talks to avert spying between allies prompted several senior German politicians on Tuesday to suggest diplomatic and economic pressure on Washington. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere (pictured), however, said that the talks were continuing, telling journalists at a Berlin press conference that negotiations remained confidential. Withholding contracts? Stephan Mayer, the new internal affairs spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative parliamentary group, told Reuters on Tuesday her government should consider withholding contracts with US firms that operate in Germany. Mayer said if the talks failed then Germany must contemplate whether \"US firms receive government contracts from the German side or public institutions.\" \"The Americans understand one language very well, and that is the language of business,\" Mayer said, adding that such a deal could not be seen in isolation from current EU-US free-trade negotiations. He also told the newspaper Die Welt that an anti-spying agreement should not amount to a \"placebo.\" Thomas Oppermann, the caucus leader of the center-left Social Democrats, who are Merkel's new coalition partners, said the \"failure of the agreement would be unacceptable\" and would \"change the political character of relations.\" Talks going nowhere? Last August, Germany announced that Berlin and Washington would negotiate a deal not to spy on each other after revelations about the US' National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance. This was compounded by allegations the US had monitored Merkel's mobile phone and European interest in the claims of the former NSA intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, who has temporary asylum in Moscow. The Munich-based S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung quoted a German source close to the 'no-spying' talks as saying: \"We're getting nothing.\" The German public broadcaster NDR jointly reported that German delegation sources had almost lost hope that an agreement would emerge. German conservative caucus leader Michael Grosse-Br\u00f6mer said he would be \"very disappointed if this agreement does not come about.\" \"We must assume that it is not appropriate when friends are spied upon and listened to when the matter does not relate to averting potential terrorist attacks,\" he said. Veteran Greens party parliamentarian Hans-Christian Str\u00f6bele, who met Snowden in Moscow late last year, told the German news agency dpa: \"We haven't made any progress because the government has been far too timid in demanding answers from the United States.\" 'Shared commitment' For months, senior US officials have signaled that Washington would not agree to a blanket pact and refused to comment on claims of US intelligence eavesdropping in Germany, including alleged monitoring of Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone. In Washington earlier on Tuesday, National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said the negotiations on a mutual spy ban were continuing with Germany Hayden gave little indication that the US government would move substantially towards the German position. \"Such consultations will continue among our intelligence services as a part of our shared commitment to strengthen our practical cooperation in a manner that reflects the shared threats we face, the technological environment in which we operate, our close relationship with one another, and our abiding respect for the civil and political rights and privacy interests of our respective citizens,\" Hayden said. New threats, says de Maiziere Interior Minister de Maiziere at his press conference said Germany faced new threats from international terrorism, requiring all legal measures possible. Speaking after consultations with the heads of Germany's intelligence services, he said 240 radicalized Islamists from Germany had gone to war-torn Syria in the past year. \"That is grounds for disquiet because they could come back with combat experience and related international contacts to possibly carry out crimes here,\" de Maiziere said. Obama to speak on NSA 'soon' Last week, US President Barack Obama phoned Merkel to invite her to Washington in the coming months, hoping to mend fences between the transatlantic allies. The chancellor accepted, although neither side has announced a date. On Tuesday, Obama told reporters he had almost concluded his deliberations on how to rein in NSA activities, in a bid to restore American public confidence following concerns spy agencies were infringing constitutional rights to privacy. \"Actually it's getting close. So I'll have plenty to say about that pretty soon,\" he said. ipj/ph (AFP, Reuters, dpa, AP)",

"story": "Growing momentum for electric cars The present-day market share for electric vehicles is tiny but growing. Automotive expert Stefan Bratzel tells DW the Dieselgate scandal could give new impetus to e-mobility. But success will not come overnight. Stefan Bratzel is director of the Center of Automotive Management (CAM) - an independent institute for empirical automotive and mobility research at the University of Applied Sciences (FHDW) in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany. Deutsche Welle: You have published the findings for the first half of this year of an international study of electric mobility. What are the main results? Stefan Bratzel: On the global level, it's a picture of growth. China is fast becoming the leading market. In the first six months, approximately 170,000 electric vehicles were sold there, including buses and light commercial vehicles. The US recorded a slight increase, but a total of only 66,000 electric cars were sold there. In Europe, there's still the major exception of Norway but not much else. For Germany, the record so far has been very sobering. The sales of purely electric vehicles fell as much as 6 percent in the first half. What about the market share for electric cars? How many e-vehicles are there compared with those with conventional internal combustion engines? The market shares is negligible. In Germany, there was a market share of 0.6 percent for electric cars among new car registrations - which could almost be a rounding error. In China, after all, we are already at a level of 1.5 percent. Although this is not much, the rate of increase is enormous - doubling within one year. But China should always be treated with caution, due to fraud and the often poor quality of the vehicles. France, too, is quite respectable, with 1.5 percent of new car registrations being electric cars. Although in some markets we can see there's been a certain amount of growth in market share, but it's still at, so to speak, homeopathic levels. Why haven't electric cars become widespread? I call it the RIP problem: range, infrastructure and price. The customers expect a minimum range of 400-500 kilometers (248-310 miles) from a car. But so far electric cars only cover distances of 150-180 kilometers - in the standard cycle. But, for example, if it's too hot outside and the air conditioning is turned on, that range drops to only 100 kilometers, which is completely insufficient and needs to be significantly increased. As for the infrastructure for charging electric cars, electric mobility is out of the question for anyone who doesn't have a garage with a power connection. Even people who do have a garage like this, but who want to travel a little bit farther, need a dense network of fast-charging stations along the way. While there are smaller efforts being made, including by the German government, they're not nearly enough to solve the problem. As far as price goes, electric cars are still significantly more expensive than comparable vehicles with internal combustion engines, and a lot still needs to happen there. The RIP formula is easy to remember - electric mobility will indeed \"rest in peace\" if these three problems are not solved. We talked about the needs of customers. How important are electric cars to manufacturers? Electric cars are becoming increasingly important for them, and I think this realization is taking hold among manufacturers. The Dieselgate scandal has made it clear that CO2 limits are increasingly difficult to reach. Not least because more and more gas-guzzling SUVs are being sold that emit a higher output of greenhouse gases than comparable vehicles. Manufacturers will not succeed in making their fleets meet ever more stringent air pollution limits without electrification. That's also why VW recently announced it planned to have purely electric vehicles make up one-quarter of its sales by 2025 - and that's only nine years away. Even one or two years ago no-one was thinking in terms of this magnitude, but now they're working on it. Whether these goals are achieved remains to be seen, but the path is at least leading in this direction. Those are ambitious targets. What do you predict will happen? I think in the next few years we will see only slight increases in market share - because of the problems I described. But from 2020 it should gain tremendous momentum. We expect that in 2025 the world every tenth, possibly every eighth vehicle will already be solely electrically powered, with the share increasing. Battery-powered electric mobility is therefore becoming increasingly important. In the long term, fuel cells could become relevant, but there are still much bigger problems to overcome with them.

"story": "Fed hikes interest rates as inflation picks up The US central bank has increased its benchmark interest rate for the first time since last December. Analysts said the move was overdue and reflected a buoyant economy and higher consumer prices. Ending its two-day policy meeting in Washington, the US Federal Reserve reported it had decided to up its key federal funds rate by 25 basis points, up from the current target range of 0.5-0.75 percent. The announcement came after a long period of no changes to the interest rates amid uncertainty over US President Donald Trump's economic agenda. Prior to Wednesday's move, the Fed had raised its key rate last December for only the second time since setting an unprecedented near-zero level at the peak of the global financial crisis in 2008. While markets had fully priced in Wednesday's rate hike, investors had been waiting for clues on the central bank's future monetary policy. There had been little doubt that the lender was now on course for regular three-monthly rises this year, but there was speculation that the rate-hike speed for 2018 and 2019 could turn out to be slightly higher. The bank said Wednesday there could be two more hikes this year, with an accelerated pace envisaged only for 2019. What made the Fed step into action? The Federal Reserve had earlier indicated that stronger signs of inflation had in no small way bolstered the argument for tighter monetary policy. The price index of personal consumption expenditures (PCE) jumped by 0.4 percent in January, showing a 1.9-percent increase for the last 12 months and thus approaching the central bank's own long-term inflation target of 2.0 percent for the first time in nearly five years. The Fed cites the spending-based PCE index as its preferred inflation gauge over the better-known consumer price index. While the latter showed only a slight 0.1-percent rise for February in data released earlier on Wednesday, the index' 12-month reading came in at 0.6 percent, reaching a nearly four-year high. The central bank was also guided by continuously good labor market figures, with roughly 200,000 new jobs created in each of the past three months and the unemployment rate standing at 4.7 percent at present. Fresh figures also showed a pickup in retail sales in the US despite delays in tax return payments, holding spending back somewhat. hg/sri (AP, dpa)",

"story": "AmCham survey reveals investment worries The American Chamber of Commerce in Germany has released its annual survey of US companies in Europe's largest economy. It shows US executives are satisfied with Germany, but don't see it as innovative as it could be. Ford is the biggest US company in Germany based on sales, while McDonald's is the US company with the most employees in the country, a survey says. The auto maker did 17.5 billion euros ($19.6 billion) in German business last year, topping the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany (AmCham)'s annual Top 50 ranking of US companies active in Germany. While the names of companies like Ford, Apple and Amazon come as no surprise, there were some changes to the rankings that may have been unexpected. For example, the second-largest company in Germany based on sales revenue in 2014 is now General Motors, through its Opel division - a company it came close to selling in 2009. It moves up one position. Rounding out the top five are ExxonMobil, Amazon, and Phillips 66, which runs Jet service stations in Germany. American jobs for German workers McDonald's 60,000 employees earned the fast-food chain the leading position in the Top 30 list of US employers in the country. That was nearly three times as many employees as second-ranked Ford's 23,000. Opel, Manpower and UPS were the next biggest US employers in Germany, all only slightly behind Ford. Alongside the rankings is a survey on Germany as an investment location. The results suggest US companies are generally satisfied with Germany, ranking the investment climate very good - even slightly better than last year. \"The perception of Germany as a business location is good. However, the figures show that 2014 was a year of reluctance regarding investment,\" Bernhard Mattes, President of AmCham Germany, who is also chairman of the management board at Ford's European operations. \"Germany continues to be important for US companies. However, it also needs to remain ambitious and be open to changes in spite of its economic strength. We need innovation and progress. In order to achieve this, the German government has to create the right conditions for doing business, companies have to spur innovation and society needs to confront changes with interest.\" Worries about the future The survey, conducted in collaboration with management consultancy Accenture, said the most important factors in retaining Germany's attractiveness as a place to do business were securing a highly-qualified workforce (64 percent), accelerating the country's digital transformation (50 percent), concluding the TTIP free-trade negotiations (46 percent), and ensuring the future of the EU's single market. Eight out of ten respondents said they believe TTIP would have a positive impact on transatlantic research cooperation. Only 16 percent said it would have little effect. But innovation is an area of concern. Some 62 percent of the US companies surveyed said the US was the clear leader in innovation, compared to 28 percent for Germany and 4 percent for China. But they expected the US and China to stand on an equal footing in a decade's time.",

"story": "Anti-Islamization protests end peacefully in Dresden and D\u00fcsseldorf Right-wing groups have organized protests with less politically extreme citizens to voice their concern over what they see as the Islamification of Europe. A counterdemonstration, however, was also joined in droves. Dresden had a relatively large turnout on Monday, with a PEGIDA-organized protest attracting over 7,500 anti-Islamification demonstrators. The Bild newspaper reported that over 10,000 people had turned out in Dresden to protest against the growing influence of Islam and Salafism in Germany: The umbrella group \"Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the West,\" or PEGIDA is a group led by previously apolitical Dresdeners who wish to distance themselves from right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis while protesting the perceived increasing influence of Islam and Salafism in Germany and the possible return of \"Islamic State\" (IS) fighters who hold European passports. On the group's Facebook page, they write: \"Dear friends, dear fellow citizens, dear patriots! Monday is Pegida Day and today too we wish to show a peaceful sign. Bring your friends and neighbors and let us show the counter-demonstrators that we are not xenophobic.\" Counterdemonstrations Despite the group's efforts to distance itself from neo-Nazis, it has attracted a very large counter-effort, which uses the hashtag #nopegida on Twitter. According to media reports, the counterdemonstration attracted around 5,000 people in Dresden on Monday. Organizers of the counterdemonstration received support from many of the city's Christian churches, the Islamic center, the Jewish community, and the university. The city's advisory board on foreigners described it as a \"march or tolerance and openness.\" Police prepared Dresden police were well prepared for the demonstrators and their opposition, cordoning off the area and setting up floodlights at the protest site so that no one could take advantage of the gathering darkness, reported German public news outlet MDR. Similar protests have been cropping up across Germany, beginning in Cologne on 26 October with a group of self-proclaimed 'hooligans' protesting Salafism, and continuing in Hanover, Kassel, and Chemnitz. The protesters represent a mix of hardline right-wingers and citizens concerned with the rapid rise of IS or the possibility of refugee housing being built in their neighborhoods. The presence of counterdemonstrators has always remained significant, however. Last Monday a demonstration was held in Kassel, where the 80 anti-Islamization marchers were stopped by 500 people opposed to their message. Demonstration in D\u00fcsseldorf In D\u00fcsseldorf, the turnout was much lower, with German public broadcaster WDR reporting that only 100 \"d\u00fcgida\" - which is similar to PEGIDA - protesters showing up: PEGIDA has threatened to return again next Monday and have called for the resignation of Helma Orosz, the mayor of Dresden, despite the fact that she has already signaled that she would depart from her position in February 2015. es,sb/sb",

"story": "Army recruitment drive heats up as conscription ends in Germany Compulsory military service ends in Germany, as of July 1. The Bundeswehr will now have to rely entirely on volunteers, and army recruitment agents are scouring jobs fairs to encourage the best and brightest to enlist. Compulsory military service, first introduced in Germany in 1957, came to an end on Friday. A package of reforms introduced last year is aiming to make the German military smaller but more flexible. The reforms mean the Bundeswehr will become a voluntary army, reduced in size by a quarter to just 185,000 soldiers, made up of 170,000 professional soldiers and 15,000 volunteers. The voluntary military service will be open to men and women and will last between 12 and 23 months, which will give volunteers the opportunity to receive training in foreign assignments. With the end of conscription, the army needs to make up the soldier shortfall, and has lately begun setting up stalls at the country's careers fairs. \"Our demand for 2011 is around 14,000 personnel,\" said Lieutenant Colonel Harry Fegert, head of the Bundeswehr recruitment center in eastern Germany. The Bundeswehr are competing at the Berlin careers fair against companies like engineering giant Siemens, chemical company Bayer and the country's biggest private bank, Deutsche Bank. Fegert says the recruitment task is \"ambitious\" but the Bundeswehr is \"attractive\" and has \"good career prospects.\" The perks For many young people, the Bundeswehr offers a chance to be paid to go to university or receive professional training. The average pay for voluntary military service is now around 700 euros a month and those who sign up for a longer commitment can receive training in 60 different jobs that will be applicable to civilian life. At a recruitment fair in M\u00f6nchengladbach, the Bundeswehr tried to win over new recruits by advertising the fun side of army training. One 18-year-old is challenged to see how many pushups he can do while carrying a heavy army backpack, while at another stall boys and girls compete in a Bundeswehr quiz. Surrounding these activities are information stalls and members of the Bundeswehr handing out information. Soldier Markus Baier was originally not interested in joining the army, but the training opportunities with the Bundeswehr changed his mind. Baier now tours local schools to give students information on joining the army, saying that \"honesty and pure information\" are important tools for recruitment. \"A job in the army is no walk in the park,\" Baier tells the schoolchildren. \"We're not looking for loners or reckless Rambo-types, nor party animals. We go to bed at 10 p.m. so we can wake up at 5 a.m..\" The importance of teamwork is also stressed by Captain Benedict Janich, chief recruitment officer for the states of Saxony and Thuringia. \"Joining the forces means joining a team and that's something where we're better than most companies,\" said Janich. \"You take responsibility very early and finally we are serving Germany, which is not the worst thing to do.\" Recruitment problems Despite the advertisements at careers fairs and in schools, one of the problems attracting volunteers is finding those of a high enough caliber. The benefit of a conscripted army is that it gives the military access to the full breadth of German society and the professional qualifications of young people. \"The average fitness of younger generations is decreasing,\" said Janich. \"Also, as a soldier you have to move at least once in two or three years and that wish for mobility is decreasing.\" This unwillingness to move is the main obstacle for soldier Markus Baier when trying to encourage school-leavers that the army might be for them. While few complain about being deployed abroad, the idea of moving to another part of Germany unnerves them. \"I'd rather stay with my family,\" is a common reply from the students. Nonetheless, between Baier and his colleagues at the M\u00f6nchengladbach fair they register more than 9,000 people who are interested in receiving more information on joining the Bundeswehr. Last month, the Defense Ministry announced that recruitment targets for this year would be reached as 10,000 people had already enlisted as lower-rank soldiers. Although some 4,500 of these were recruited from the last batch of conscripts, those at jobs fairs across Germany seem optimistic they'll make their targets for 2012 as well.

"story": "Obama in Mexico for trade talks, calls for dialog in Venezuela and Ukraine US President Barack Obama in Toluca for trade talks with Mexico and Canada proposed an expansion of trade agreements for the Americas into Asia. Obama also spoke out on the unrest in Venezuela and Ukraine. Obama spent a day south of the US border with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper with a focus on trade discussions around the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade bloc of 12 countries in the Americas, Asia and the Pacific. \"We are wanting to see and committed to seeing a good, comprehensive Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. I think it's in all of our interests,\" Harper said. Obama said the North American partners must maintain their \"competitive advantage\" on trade, in part by expanding into the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region. Obama acknowledged that \"elements in my party\" oppose the TPP deal, but said: \"We'll get this passed if it's a good agreement.\" At issue between the US and Canada, has been the US review of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry oil from tar sands in western Canada over a thousand miles to Nebraska, where existing pipelines would then carry the crude to refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast. Environmental groups have opposed it, and Obama has said he won't approve it if it increases greenhouse gas emissions. For Mexico, the focus is on an overhaul of US immigration laws and Obama said immigration reform remained one of his highest priorities. But Republican opposition in Congress is likely to prevent new laws being passed this year. The North America Leaders' Summit - also known as the \"Three Amigos\" meeting - coincided with the 20th year of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) among the three countries. A third of US exports go to Mexico and Canada and the trade supports 14 million jobs on US soil, US officials say. But NAFTA has been criticized within the US for its effect on jobs and environmental protection. Pena Nieto heralded the \"innovative spirit\" that spurred NAFTA and said new trade agreements were: \"bound to go beyond the progress that each one of our countries has made.\" Venezuela and Ukraine Speaking about unrest in Venezuela and Ukraine, Obama denounced the \"unacceptable violence in those two countries which the United States strongly condemns.\" Obama called on Venezuela's government to release protesters detained in recent demonstrations and address the \"legitimate grievances\" of its people. He said: \"along with the Organization of American States we call on the Venezuelan government to release protesters it has detained and engage in real dialogue.\" On Sunday, left-wing President Nicolas Maduro ordered the expulsion of three US diplomats, accusing them of meeting student leaders under the guise of offering them visas. On Ukraine, Obama gave a cautious welcome to the truce announced between government and opposition on Wednesday. \"My hope is at this point that a truce may hold but ... ultimately the government is responsible for making sure that we shift toward some sort of unity government, even if it's temporary, that allows us to move to fair and free elections so that the will of the Ukrainian people can be rightly expressed without the kinds of chaos we've seen on the streets,\" Obama said. jm / crh (AFP, AP)",

"story": "China protests Myanmar bombing on its territory, sends jets to border Beijing has sent fighter jets to its border and summoned Myanmar's ambassador after a Yangon airstrike within China killed four citizens. The bombing was part of Myanmar's offensive against rebels in its north. Fighter jets monitored China's border to Myanmar on Saturday after a bomb from a Myanmar aircraft hit a sugarcane field in the Chinese border city of Lincang and killed four people. Nine others were injured, news agency Xinhua reported. The strike, which came as Yangon's forces were battling rebels in the north at the Chinese border, followed a similar incident some days back when a stray shell from Myanmar exploded in Chinese territory. The jets were sent to \"track, monitor, warn and chase away\" Myanmar military aircraft flying near the shared border, news agency DPA quoted the Chinese Air Force spokesman Shen Jinke as saying. Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin also summoned Yangon's ambassador Thit Linn Ohn to protest the incident. China \"strongly condemns\" the incident and calls on Myanmar to carry out a thorough investigation, report the findings to China, punish the guilty and take steps to ensure similar events do not occur, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Myanmar denies accusations Myanmar officials, on the other hand, said their offensive took place after they informed Chinese officials of their plan and that their attacks were carried out \"strictly adhering to the information we told them.\" \"The targets of all our aerial attacks were inside our territory,\" Yangon official Zaw Htay told Reuters, accusing rebels of \"purposely creating the attacks with the intent of causing misunderstanding between China and us.\" Myanmar's offensive against rebels in its Kokang region, at China's southwest, has sent thousands of people fleeing across the border into China. Myanmar's forces have blamed the latest fighting on a renegade rebel faction led by Phone Kya Shin, who attempted to seize Laukkai, the capital of the self-administered Kokang region. US officials have also accused Phone, also known as Peng Jiashing, of playing a major role in trafficking opium and methamphetamines. The guerrilla faction used to be part of the Burmese Communist Party, backed by China until it signed a ceasefire with Yangon in 1989. Myanmar officials however still accuse former Chinese soldiers of training the rebels, a charge Beijing denies. mg/ng (dpa, AP, Reuters)",

"story": "Nationwide strike a partial success in India Opposition parties and trade unions in India took to the streets in a day-long strike over the government's plan to open the retail sector to global supermarket chains to kickstart a sluggish economy. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government has been buffeted by a string of corruption scandals and now faces another serious problem - one of his own survival, as it is now up in the air whether his government will last its full term until 2014. Having announced a raft of reforms designed to revive a slowing economy - a move that has sparked a furious backlash - the biggest ally pulled out of the shaky coalition earlier this week raising the risk of an early election. In response, a majority of traders and shopkeepers especially in opposition-ruled states downed shutters while supporters blocked railways tracks. Road traffic was totally paralyzed in eastern state of West Bengal, which also witnessed sporadic clashes between supporters of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the ruling Trinamool Congress. \"This is only the beginning, our struggle will continue till these anti-people polices are reversed. The government should not underestimate the power of dissent and today it was there for all to see,\" said Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Nitin Gadkari. Just last week, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government announced the decision to go ahead with the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in retail, aviation and broadcasting following criticism against it over policy paralysis. It also announced the decision to hike diesel prices by 14 percent to reduce the increasing subsidy costs faced by the country. Life crippled in opposition-ruled states The decisions forced the Trinamool Congress, a key ally propping the government, to snap ties with the ruling alliance in Delhi. Realizing the government was in a spot, opposition parties made political capital and organized a nationwide shutdown. \"The tragedy is that our prime minister (Manmohan Singh) has begun to worship the US. We are heading towards economic slavery,\" said Communist Party of India-Marxist leader Sitaram Yechury. While Mumbai, the financial hub of India, was largely untouched as the Shiv Sena - which rules the city's municipal corporation - was not supporting the strike, public transport was skeletal in other major cities, including New Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai and Bangalore. The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), one of the biggest groupings of Indian traders, claimed that an estimated 50 million shopkeepers across India had participated in it. \"The strike was very successful. All our 25,000 trade associations had called the strike and all traders participated in it,\" said Praveen Khandelwal, the group's general secretary. Shutdown bleeds economy The government put up a brave front despite the strike's success in vast swathes of the country and maintained protesters were only hurting the economy they claimed to be defending. \"The right to protest is a democratic one and nobody is disputing that. But the hurt it is causing to casual workers and those in factories who have to earn wages is enormous. Also the economy suffers,\" said federal Finance Minister P. Chidambaram. According to the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), a business chamber of commerce, the nationwide strike is estimated to cause losses running to the tune 2.25 billion US dollars (around 1.7 billion euros) to the Indian economy. \"Today's bandh [strike] has been disruptive for business and trade in many parts of the country. While an exact loss for the entire economy is not known, it can be estimated that almost 12,500 crore [125 billion] rupees has been the loss to the country in terms of disruptions in production and trade,\" the CII said in a statement. The industry association also asked the government not to roll back the recent reform measures under political pressure.",

"story": "Jewelry found at Sobibor could be linked to Anne Frank: researchers A Jewish girl's necklace found at the former Sobibor Nazi death camp has led researchers to speculate she may have known the famous diarist Anne Frank. The pendant belonged to Karoline Cohn, also of Frankfurt. Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial said Karoline Cohn's necklace with a triangular pendant was unearthed at the former death camp by researchers, who believe it fell between floorboards when taken off on the way to the gas chambers. The museum issued an appeal Sunday, urging anyone or surviving relatives who knew more about Cohn to make contact with Yad Vashem. The necklace - engraved with three small Stars of David, the date July 3, 1929, and the word \"Frankfurt\" - appeared to closely resemble one that belonged to Anne Frank, who perished at Bergen-Belsen, east of Hannover, in early 1945, aged 15. Frank and Cohn were both born in Frankfurt in 1929. Necklace unearthed at Sobibor More than 250,000 Jews were killed in Sobibor in then-Nazi-occupied Poland during World War Two, as the Hitler regime carried out its systematic murder of 6 million Jews across Europe. The excavations at Sobibor, involving researchers from Poland, the Netherlands and Israel's Antiquities Authority and conducted since 2007, have so far uncovered the gas-chamber foundations and train platform used by the Nazis. On the pendant were also the Hebrew letter \"heh,\" symbolizing God, and the word \"Mazal Tov,\" literally translated as \"good luck,\" but used as an expression of congratulations for a joyous or significant occurrence. Ex-guard Demjanjuk One of the guards at Sobibor, John Demjanjuk, was convicted in 2011 by a Munich court of being an accessory to the murders of more than 28,000 Jews on the sole ground that he been present at the death camp. His conviction set a belated landmark legal precedent for German courts, which had previously argued that the top Nazi leadership was mainly to blame. Demjanjuk, a former autoworker in the US state of Ohio, died in 2012 before his appeal application was heard. He had denied serving at Sobibor. Ministry shielded ex-Nazi jurists A recent German Justice Ministry study compiled by historians and published last October found that Germany's immediate post-war justice system was infested with ex-Nazis who shielded each other. Current German Justice Minister Heiko Maas said the study helped explain why post-war German courts convicted only around 6,650 ex-Nazis, a tiny fraction of the membership in Hitler's NSDAP party. \"The Nazi-era lawyers went on to cover up old injustice rather than to uncover it, and thereby created new injustice,\" said Maas. Jurists who survived the war in exile or joined the anti-Nazi resistance remained largely unemployed by the ministry. ipj/tj (AFP, Reuters, dpa)",

Nelson Mandela has been released from a military hospital in Pretoria a day after undergoing a minor operation. \"The doctors have decided to send him home as the diagnostic procedure he underwent did not indicate anything seriously wrong with him,\" a statement released by President Jakob Zuma's office said. The country's defense minister, Lindiwe Sisulu, denied reports that the 93-year-old former president had undergone a hernia operation. \"It wasn't the surgery that has been out there in the media at all,\" Sisulu said. \"He's as fine as he can be at his age.\" Abdominal pain The procedure conducted on Mandela, known as a laparoscopy, involved inserting a tiny camera into his abdomen. He had been admitted to hospital on Saturday for what officials described as \"longstanding abdominal pain.\" Mandela has been in poor health since being hospitalized with breathing problems a year ago. His last public appearance came at the final of the 2010 World Cup in Johannesburg. Mandela spent 27 years in jail for his role in fighting white minority rule in South Africa.

"story": "Comcast to buy GE's stake in NBCUniversal Comcast Corp. has agreed to buy the remaining 49 percent stake in NBCUniversal from its joint venture partner General Electric. The deal will give Comcast full control of the US media and entertainment behemoth. \"This is an exciting day for Comcast as we have agreed to accelerate the purchase of NBCUniversal,\" Comcast chief executive Brian Roberts said on Tuesday, ending the joint venture between his company and GE that was first created two years ago. Comcast, the largest cable TV operator in the US, now acquires full control of the NBC broadcast empire, cable networks, filmed entertainment, theme parks, regional sports networks and certain digital media properties. The deal calls for $16.7 billion (12.42 billion Euros) for the NBCU brand assets and another $1.4 billion in NBC's interest in the 30 Rockefeller Center office buildings in midtown New York City and CNBC's headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. Comcast bought a 51 percent stake in NBCUniversal in January 2011, leaving the remaining 49 percent to GE. Comcast had planned to take a larger stake in it over seven years, paying from operating cash, starting in 2014. The deal is seen as beneficial to both sides. GE will get cash for its stake earlier than expected and Comcast will benefit more from the rising price of the rights to sports and other TV programs. The deal \"allows us to significantly increase the cash we plan to return to shareholders in 2013, to approximately $18 billion, and to continue to invest in our industrial business,\" said GE chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt. \"For nearly 30 years, NBC - and later NBCUniversal - has been a great business for GE and our investors,\" Immelt added. \"We are proud of our stewardship of the business and our association with the NBCU brand.\" Comcast said it would finance the deal, which is expected to close by the end of March, with $11.4 billion of cash on hand, $4 billion in debt owed, $2 billion from its own credit lines and $725 million in preferred stock issued to GE. NBCUniversal is valued at around $34 billion, up from $30 billion when Comcast first acquired its 51 percent stake in the company two years ago. After the deal was announced, Comcast's stock jumped 6.4 percent to $41.46 per share, while GE shares rose 3.6 percent to $23.39. dr/jr (AP, AFP, dpa)",

"story": "Pact with a dictator? Syrian President Bashir al-Assad is isolated on the world stage. But now he's offering the West military cooperation in the fight against \"Islamic State,\" painting himself as a guarantor of stability. When the Arab Spring unfolded in Syria, it appeared that the Syrian president's fate was sealed. The heads of state of other Arab countries had fallen one by one: Ben Ali fled, Mubarak was ousted, Gadhafi was murdered. Things weren't looking good for Bashar al-Assad in the autumn of 2011. Thousands of Syrians were protesting against their president, fighting his regime with all they had. But Assad refused to be chased away. He issued continual warnings against the \"Islamist terrorists\" in his country, and clamped down brutally on his own people. The march of the Islamists Three years and more than 190,000 deaths later, Assad's warning looks more and more like the truth. Militants of the \"Islamic State\" group are advancing across the country, fighting mercilessly for a religious state. They murder anyone who stands in their way. The Islamic extremists, supported by thousands of volunteer fighters from the Arab world and Europe, have taken hold of large areas of both Syria and Iraq. In the beginning, they mainly fought against Syrian rebels, strengthening the regime in Damascus. Now, the militants are also targeting Syria's government troops. The United States, as well as many European and Arab governments, sees the caliphate as a provocation. Islamic State has given Syria and the West a common enemy - something that could play into the hands of the government in Damascus, said Syria expert Petra Becker of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin. \"From the very beginning, Assad denounced the revolution - which was actually about democracy and human rights - as an insurgency of Salafist jihadists,\" Becker said. At the same time, Becker added, Assad granted amnesty to a number of imprisoned jihadists at the start of the uprising, in the knowledge that they would try to establish terror cells in Syria: \"He stood back and watched as jihadists spread across the country. He did everything he could to radicalize the forces at play in the revolution in order to support his narrative.\" Secret torture methods Against the backdrop of the brutal terrorist methods the \"Islamic State\" uses and celebrates in the media, the torture methods used by the Syrian regime appear less drastic. The Syrian government also does all it can to keep such things shrouded in secrecy. But with the capture of the strategically important air base in Tabqa in the northern province of Raqqa, \"Islamic State\" has turned into a problem that is larger than the government expected. Not even Assad himself likely could have predicted such resistance. And yet his strategy appears to be working. The fear-inducing enemy in his own country could help Assad to break through his international isolation. \"This is the moment for Assad to capitalize on his past policy,\" said Becker. \"If he can manage to convince Western states to accept him as a partner in the war against terror, he will have secured his power for the years to come.\" Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem has already floated the idea of a cooperation between Damascus and the United States. \"Geographically and strategically, Syria is at the center of an international coalition against Islamic State,\" Muallem said. \"Any states who seriously want to fight this terror should side with us.\" The lesser evil? On Tuesday, the US military began surveillance flights over Syria in preparation for possible air strikes. American broadcaster NBC reported that surveillance drones are being used to prepare attacks against the terrorist group on Syrian territory. Political leaders in Washington denied that the government was cooperating with Damascus. They say they don't want to strengthen the position of a dictator. But given what's known about the terrorists of \"Islamic State,\" Assad could look like the lesser evil in the eyes of many in the West, even though he ordered the oppression and killing of his own people.",

"story": "Schr\u00f6der Under Attack for Remarks German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der has come under fire for saying that German corporate heads are failing to create new jobs in spite of business-friendly reforms initiated by his government. On Tuesday, senior representatives of German industry denied Schr\u00f6der's allegations, saying that investments in Germany would continue to be made although conditions were far from ideal. Opposition politicians accused the chancellor of trying to deflect attention from the fact that his economic policy was a shambles. The German chancellor has grown increasingly edgy in recent weeks: Two months before a crucial regional election, his center-left government is battered by political scandals, strategy blunders and an economic crisis that won't go away. Losing the election in the industrial state of North Rhine-Westphalia in May would severely hamper the chancellor's ability to act by giving the opposition sufficient clout to block his legislative moves. Now the chancellor has identified a scapegoat responsible for his troubles. German business leaders, he told Bild on Sunday newspaper, should stop moving jobs abroad and start investing in Germany again. He claimed that corporate conditions were now excellent after his government had slashed taxes and labor unions had made compromises on wages and working hours. Party backs Schr\u00f6der On Tuesday, SPD leader Franz M\u00fcntefering joined the chancellor's criticism. \"We have taken various steps in recent years that have helped companies improve their competitiveness,\" he said. \"And many companies have been rather successful in this. But there are also bad examples of corporations moving thousands of job abroad and we are now calling on them to make greater efforts and start investing in Germany again.\" German corparate leaders, however, rejected Schr\u00f6der's allegations and said blame-throwing wouldn't help in difficult times. Business leaders call for more reforms Ludwig Braun, the president of the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce, argued that investments in German industry were rising again in spite of the fact that conditions were hardly ideal here. The head of the German metal-working employers, Martin Kannegiesser, said the chancellor must come to understand that globalization requires a strong presence in foreign markets. Reducing Germany's 5.2 million unemployed people, he added, will take a long time and requires much more sweeping political reforms. Opposition leaders such as CDU general secretary Volker Kauder have been more stinging in their criticism of Schr\u00f6der. \"This is just a ploy by the chancellor to deflect attention from his government's huge policy failures,\" he said. \"He wants to distract from the visa scandal involving foreign minister Joschka Fischer and his own inability to create conditions in Germany that are conducive to investments here.\" Matching words with deeds Christine Scheel, finance policy expert of Schr\u00f6der's junior coalition partners in the government, the Greens, said the chancellor should match his words with deeds now. It can no longer be tolerated she said that German companies, for example, can even write off against taxes the costs associated with moving jobs abroad. \"I don't think that such behavior is alright,\" she said. \"It's become a really big problem that companies have moved jobs abroad. The fact that this is even fostered by tax write-offs is something no-one can understand.\" Schr\u00f6der, who used to be dubbed \"Darling of the Bosses,\" now feels let down and betrayed by corporate leaders: A recent survey of the top 30 German corporations reveals that they eliminated a total of 35,000 jobs in Germany last year alone. At the same time more than 9,000 jobs have been created at their foreign subsidiaries. In view of record unemployment of 12.6 percent of the work force, the chancellor's political fortunes have slumped drastically making victory in general elections next year ever more unlikely.",

"story": "Bavarian government to release new refugee policy so 'Germany remains Germany' Amid an ongoing dispute with Berlin, Bavaria's government is due to finalize its proposal for Germany's refugee policy. As well as a yearly cap on refugee arrivals, Premier Horst Seehofer is calling for tighter borders. The ever-growing divide between Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), showed no sign of resolving itself on Saturday, with Munich's local newspaper the \"M\u00fcnchner Merkur\" reporting that the Bavarian government is due on Tuesday to finalize its overall concept on refugee and immigration policy in Germany. The charter titled \"So that Germany remains Germany\" was reportedly written by CSU leader and Bavarian Premier Horst Seehofer. At the top of the agenda is the CSU's long-time demand for an upper-limit on the number of asylum seekers accepted in Germany - something Bavaria aims to achieve through EU quotas. For months, the CSU has called a yearly cap of no more than 200,000 refugees, a move that Merkel has repeatedly rejected. The debate has prompted an unwelcome divide in the so-called \"Union\" of conservative CDU and CSU - particularly in the year of Germany's federal election. Unrest among conservatives The CSU, which often takes more conservative stances than the CDU, has sharply criticized Merkel's open-door policies that allowed more than a million people to enter the country as refugees and migrants since 2015. Last month Seehofer even ruled out governing with Merkel's CDU should they refuse to introduce an upper limit on the number of migrants entering Germany. In an apparent attempt to calm the rumbling debate, Merkel's CDU proposed on Friday the idea of flexible annual targets for asylum seeker numbers. The Christian Democrats gave no precise numbers but called for Germany to set a new target each year based on the humanitarian situation in global crisis zones and Germany's ability to absorb newcomers. Alongside its refugee cap, the Bavarian state government is also proposing further restrictions on family reunions for refugees, possibly calling for asylum-seekers to secure a livelihood independent of state subsidies before being permitted to apply for family members to join them in Germany. The basic protection for migrants in old age should also be restricted if they have not spent the most important period of working life in Germany, the Bavarian government wrote, adding that asylum-seekers who commit a criminal offense in Germany also \"forfeit their right to hospitality\" and must be deported. 'Humanitarian responsibility' At the same time, however, the paper also states its commitment to the reception of refugees. \"The admission of those in need of protection is a requirement of Christian and humanitarian responsibility,\" the document reads, adding that Germany must proceed with \"zero tolerance against xenophobia, racism and anti-Semitism.\" The charter also calls for the expansion of aid to developing countries, with Seehofer demanding an \"African Act\" from the European Union (EU). Aid programs can no longer be underfunded, the paper continues, noting that without the financial support, misery and distress would increase in refugee camps. Schengen under pressure In light of the terror attack on Berlin last month, the Bavarian government is also proposing tighter border controls. Twelve people were killed and almost 50 others injured, when a truck was rammed into a Berlin Christmas market. Police suspect Tunisian asylum-seeker and \"Islamic State\" (IS) sympathizer Anis Amri was behind the wheel. After fleeing the scene on Decmeber 19, Amri was able to cross Germany's border into the Netherlands and travel via France to Italy, where he was later killed in a police shootout in Milan. His unchecked travel was possible due to the Schengen Zone - the EU's borderless travel region. In light of the growing number of terror attacks, however, the Schengen agreement is being put under increasing pressure, with Merkel also ordering a comprehensive review of Germany's security infrastructure.",

"story": "High expectations for Germany's new president Joachim Gauck's election as new German presidant was no surprise. But politicians and religious leaders are optimistic that his term in office will be marked by honesty and tolerance. There was a strong sense of satisfaction and relief in Berlin after Joachim Gauck was voted in as Germany's new president on Sunday. Politicians from almost all parties where pleased with the result - Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was glad that Gauck received an overwhelming majority in the Federal Assembly. Her conservative Christian Democrats initially had been hesitant to back Gauck as a candidate but eventually did throw their weight behind him. Merkel said that Gauck's acceptance speech made it clear he'd be a president with the people's concerns at heart. But also that he held high respect for politicians. \"I think, we'll be working together very well,\" Merkel said. Germany's image abroad The chancellor said she'd be in dialogue with Gauck just as she'd been with his predecessors. And should there be disagreements, that'd just be something that will strengthen democracy, she added. Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle was optimistic that Gauck would improve the image of Germany abroad. He told DW that it was especially Gauck's personal history and his struggle against the East German communist regime that could play a vital part in this. Gauck's story, Westerwelle said, was his struggle for freedom and the sense of responsibility borne from that. The new president could therefore become an example for those around the world who are still struggling for freedom and liberation. President, not king The opposition Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens had already backed Gauck in the previous presidential poll in 2010. \"Gauck is the right man at the right time,\" SPD parliamentary leader and former Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said. He said that Gauck, who is not affiliated with any of the political parties, might not always be an easy president to get along with, in that he would not hesitate to stand up to the political mainstream. But he certainly would be a president who'd be honest and independent. J\u00fcrgen Trittin of the Greens said that while he expected differences in opinion between his party and the future president , he still looked forward to constructive debates and discussions with Gauck. The president is not a king, Trittin said, adding that \"if you're president of Germany, you don't have to compromise your opinion just to please others.\" Other candidates It was just the Left party that remained more hesitant to welcome the new president. The party had fielded their own candidate, Beate Klarsfeld. Left party floor leader Gesine L\u00f6tzsch cautioned that Gauck might have a lot to learn to fill his new post and might have to alter some of his views. But she conceded she was impressed that he did pay the Left party a visit to talk to the parliamentarians. Ahead of the vote, the government had explicitly excluded the Left party from talks on who to nominate. The Left party is still seen in association with its predecessor, the communist party of former East Germany. Religious tolerance Religious leaders also sent their congratulations to Gauck who himself was once a Lutheran pastor. The head of Germany's Lutheran community, Nikolaus Schneider, said he was looking forward to fresh impulses coming from Gauck. After the scandals and criticism surrounding his predecessor, Christian Wulff, Gauck was expected to lead the presidency back into calmer waters. The head of the Catholic bishops' conference, Robert Zollitsch, said Gauck was marked by a high level of credibility and broad acceptance among the population. Germany's Muslim community also congratulated Gauck, expressing hope that he would work towards more acceptance and tolerance for Muslims in Germany. The head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Dieter Graumann, said he hoped Gauck would take a strong stance against racism and anti-Semitism. First comments Gauck himself said after the vote that he'd be cautious about the high expectations that the public had about him taking office. \"People have to accept me the way I am. I am a person with rough edges.\" He said he was happy about the overwhelming result of the vote and about the fact that he's the first president from what used to be communist East Germany. His first trip abroad is scheduled for neighboring Poland, a country which shared his experience of the struggle against dictatorship. The new president dismissed accusations that his concept of freedom was one-dimensional, only formed by his experiences in East Germany but not informed by current social problems in modern-day Germany. Social justice was a central concern for him, Gauck said. Yet the new president did not go into too much detail on politics in his comments after the vote. His first major speech is expected at his swearing-in ceremony next Friday. Author: Bettina Marx / ai Editor: Darren Mara",

"story": "Financial expert: A debt avalanche is on the way Cologne-based financial strategist Philip Vorndran says inflation is the only way out of the European debt crisis. But that would not only shrink debt, it would also slash people's savings. DW: You recently published a book entitled \"The Debt Avalanche\" - referring, of course, to the debt crisis in Europe. If we picture an avalanche, where are we right now? At the bottom of the mountain, which means the avalanche hasn't fully hit us yet, or are we in its midst already? Phillipp Vorndran: We are convinced that we are in its early stages, we feel the avalanche's suction, its air draft. But we are not yet past the most dangerous parts of the debt avalanche. You say the debt crisis - this landslide - can only be stopped by inflation, which means a drop in the purchasing power of money and rising prices. How can that function? In theory, you can reduce debt in four different ways. The Greeks have shown us the easiest way, debt restructuring. But that is unrealistic, we won't see that in the large economies because the central banks will balk at the concept. The second option is the \"Swabian housewife\" model: austerity. Here, unfortunately, we are all 15 years too late. If we all started saving now and putting the brakes on spending, we would quickly reach a state of economic Armageddon, comparable to the situation in the 1930s. That is something politicians certainly do not want, and it would also be a massive challenge to apeaceful social coexistence. The third theoretical option is growth - nominal growth, which is greater than the increase in debt. That is not a realistic scenario within the Western World, we have too many demographic challenges. That leaves higher inflation. If you have a look at how widely the central banks have already opened their purse strings then it is, as former ECB chief economist J\u00fcrgen Stark put it, just a matter of time. Isn't inflation unfair to people who have been saving money? Sooner or later, their assets would be considerably reduced. That is true but one should not forget: there is no painless solution to the debt crisis. I believe a political consensus has been reached - to ensure there is no threat to social peace - to get the wealthy involved rather than those at the other end of the social scale. In that scenario, people who have saved money for decades lose out. That is what happened with Germany's hyperinflation in the early 1920s when all those who had put their money in assets such as savings accounts and insurance policies were mercilessly dispossessed. If you say inflation is the only way out, what should I do now? Should I spend my money? That is a possibility. That's what you see when you look at the statistics for luxury labels in Germany and other large economies. Many people say they do not know what they will be able to afford tomorrow, so I will buy the car today that I planned to buy in three years. That is one option. The other is to think about securing one's assets as realistically as possible in such an environment. The first idea many Germans come up with is to buy real estate. That is something I can touch, an actual building. No matter what happens to inflation, no one can take it away. That is one of the reasons why real estate prices in Germany are on the rise. A word on Greece, where the arguments have started again: will the state go bankrupt? Should they leave the eurozone? Should they get more money? Is Greece a lost cause or can the country still grow out of the crisis, or cut spending enough? In 2009 we already said, Greece is bankrupt. Then German politicians criticized us for being irresponsible and unsettling Germans savers. But for us, it was a mathematical certainty: Greece does not have a business model to survive within the eurozone. Nothing has changed. It is clear that sooner or later, Greece will have to leave the eurozone. The alternative is that strong economies such as Finland, Germany, the Netherlands and Austria agree to permanently support this hopeless case. Does Germany even need the euro? If the Greeks give up, Portugal, Spain and others might also exit the eurozone, which might eventually dissolve. The euro in its present form can not survive. Either weaker countries will leave - Portugal, Greece, possibly Spain and Italy - or we must leave. We believe the former is the more likely option. We are not convinced Germany benefits greatly from the euro. We also do not believe our economy will founder if the euro disappears. Of course there will be an appreciation of a new German currency. For a while, we will have to burden the German export industry. But Germany is more than the sum of its exports. Germany also has citizens who save money and their buying power should be heard just as loudly in the discussion as the permanent hymns of praise to the export industry. If you want to export goods, you need buyers. The debt landslide is heading not only to Europe, but to the US, Japan and other parts of the world as well. That is true. The conclusion should be close scrutiny of the German business model. Is it a good idea to live off an export industry whose goods are shipped all over the world and where payments are often made on paper only. Germany must also consider whether a policy of stimulating domestic demand shouldn't be a long term element in the political strategy. Where debt is concerned, the old economies - apart from many eurozone member states, they include Britain, the US and Japan - have problems the same as we do. In the long run, these old economies will no longer be able to buy our goods to the same extent as before. Other economies will fill the gap. A look at German exports to the eurozone since the introduction of the euro shows a clear decline. But apparently, based on quality - and despite high prices - Germany manages to find buyers for its products in emerging markets. Philipp Vorndran is a capital market strategist with the renowned Cologne portfolio management firm Flossbach von Storch. The business economist previously held the position of chief strategist for global asset management at Credit Suisse; he also worked for the Swiss private bank Julius B\u00e4r and the University of W\u00fcrzburg. Vorndran is the author of \"The debt avalanche\". In his book, he explains why only inflation can resolve the debt crisis in Europe. Interview : Bernd Riegert / db Editor: Michael Lawton",

"story": "Oscar Pistorius taken to hospital with chest pains, reports say Oscar Pistorius has been taken to hospital for overnight observation. The South African athlete, who is serving a six-year jail term for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, was reportedly suffering chest pains. Jailed Paralympic champion Oscar Pistorius was taken from Pretoria's Atteridgeville prison to a medical facility for checks, a spokesman for the South African Department of Correctional Services said Thursday. \"This morning he went for a medical examination and he was scheduled to return back (to jail), but he will now be kept overnight for observation,\" the spokesman, Logan Maistry, said, without elaborating on Pistorius's condition. Local media reported that the 30-year-old double-amputee was suffering from chest pains and was taken by ambulance to the emergency department at Kalafong Hospital. This is the second time Pistorius has left prison for medical treatment. Last August he was taken to hospital with wrist injuries, which prison authorities said he sustained after falling in his cell. Pistorius is one year into a six-year jail sentence for the 2013 shooting death of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. The Paralympic athlete has always maintained that he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder when he fired multiple times at her through a locked toilet door at his Pretoria home. Sometimes dubbed the \"Blade Runner,\" Pistorius soared to international fame after becoming the first amputee to compete against able-bodied athletes in the 2012 Olympic Games. nm/kms (AP, AFP, dpa)",

"story": "Canadian judge grants bail to ex-Guantanamo detainee A Canadian judge has granted bail to a former Guantanamo inmate while he fights his conviction in a Washington court for war crimes, including killing a US soldier. Omar Khadr could get his next breath of freedom May 5. A Canadian court has granted bail pending appeal to the former Guantanamo detainee Omar Khadr. He was captured at the age of 15 in 2002 on a battlefield in Afghanistan and sent to the US prison on Cuban territory. Judge June Ross had ruled that Khadr had a strong basis for appealing the sentence that would otherwise last until 2018 and that keeping him behind bars would not serve the public interest. \"Omar is fortunate to be back in Canada, where we have real courts and real laws,\" Nate Whitling, one of Khadr's lawyers, said on Friday In 2010, after he had already spent eight years in prison, Khadr received an eight-year sentence from a US military commission after agreeing to a plea deal that stipulated that he would serve only one year of his sentence at the US naval base. He has since said he only pleaded guilty to get out of Guantanamo and return to Canada. The commission convicted Khadr on five counts, including throwing the grenade that killed a sergeant in the US Army during a 2002 firefight. Khadr was the first person since World War Two prosecuted in a war crimes tribunal for acts committed as a juvenile. His attorneys had requested bail pending an appeal before the US Court of Military Commission Review. Khadr's attorneys said his father, Ahmed Said Khadr - an alleged al Qaeda financier who once brought the family to stay with Osama bin Laden during Omar's childhood - had pushed the teenager into war. Egypt-born, Ahmed died with other Qaeda operatives in 2003. In February, a US commission overturned the terrorism conviction of an Australian inmate at Guantanamo. 'A normal life' Canada's government argues that Ross had no jurisdiction to hear Khadr's application. Giving him bail would undermine international relations and obligations, government attorneys argued. They added that Ross should have taken into account the fact that Khadr had pleaded guilty to serious offenses. Dennis Edney, one of Khadr's attorneys, told CBC that he and his wife invited Khadr to stay at their home in Edmonton. Edney and his wife have also offered to pay Khadr's tuition at a local Christian college. \"He will go to school,\" Edney told CBC on Friday. \"He will continue his education. He will probably find some part-time employment. He will live a normal life.\" The continued presence of the US military prison on Cuban territory has proved a troublesome point in negotiations between the two nations toward normalizing relations. mkg/sms (Reuters, AFP, AP)",

"story": "World Bank Spends Billions to Allay Food Crisis The World Bank on Thursday, May 29, launched a new $1.2 billion program to get emergency aid to countries suffering from global food shortages and surging prices. The new program will get at least $200 billion (128 billion euros) in grants to the poorest countries worst hit by the high cost of food, which the UN and World Bank have said is threatening to reverse nearly a decade of successes in reducing global poverty. Grants totalling $25 million were approved Thursday for Haiti, Djibouti and Liberia -- the first under the new facility. Haiti and others have suffered riots and even the dismissal of its government over food shortages. Another 10 countries have made requests for grants. The remaining $1 billion will be divided up through a mixture of grants and loans in a streamlined process that effectively bypasses the usual votes required by the bank's board of member countries. Plans to step up food production World Bank President Robert Zoellick said developing nations -- especially in Africa -- are seeking immediate resources for projects that could drastically increase food production, such as buying seeds and fertilizers for the upcoming harvest season. \"These initiatives will help address the immediate danger of hunger and malnutrition for the two billion people struggling to survive in the face of rising food prices,\" Zoellick said in a statement. Total World Bank support for agricultural programs will increase to $6 billion in 2009 from $4 billion in 2008, the development bank said. Zoellick said he will push for a clear action plan at a UN meeting in Rome from June 3-5 to tackle the food crisis and provide poor countries with immediate support. \"We don't need to reinvent the wheel. These leaders are asking for action now,\" he told reporters in a conference call from Japan.",

"story": "Referendum for Thailand's New Constitution Demonstrators vowed Monday to stage a fresh rally against Thailand's junta, after clashes with police at a Bangkok protest on Sunday left scores injured. Protesters have also begun rallying against the new constitution which the junta unveiled earlier this month and is set to go to a referendum next month. The military-backed transitional government has promised new elections but the people will first have to sanction the new constitution. Phisit Lee-Atham is a member of the Constitution Drafting Council and he is confident that the new draft is much more democratic than the scrapped 1997 constitution: \"In the old constitution the head of government was given too much power. He could use it without there being any checks and balances. But this time, we've made it easier for the Opposition to put votes of no confidence to the parliament so there will be more checks and balances in the future.\" Previously, 40 percent of the parliament's votes were necessary but the new draft says 20 percent suffice for a vote of no confidence. Anti-Thaksin constitution? The new draft has been termed an anti-Thaksin constitution. The prime minister, who was ousted in a military coup last September, was notorious for eating away the democratic system. He was accused of gambling away all legitimation for running the country with his corrupt behaviour. Surat Horachaikul is from Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok: \"I have always told people how Thaksin Shinawatra's government directly tried to hinder independent organisations. The putsch didn't tear the constitution in half, Thaksin had already done it.\" Thaksin was also known for mixing political and business interests. His family-owned \"Shin Corp\", which has since been sold to an investment company in Singapore, clearly benefited from Thaksin's six years in office. One of the main points of the new constitution is that future prime ministers cannot conduct business activities whilst in political office. Information drive A massive image campaign has been planned to inform the country about the new constitution. But critics are sceptical. Because the draft constitution that gives the military more power in crisis situations is a consequence of an illegitimate putsch of September 2006. So many want the old 1997 constitution to be modified -- some say it was the best Thailand ever had. The media lawyer Supinya Klangnarong was once charged with slander by the \"Shin Corp\" and is an outspoken critic of Thaksin but she also protested against the military when it scrapped the old constitution: \"We deeply regret that the popular constitution was abolished. It was one of the most democratic ones and one which the whole country took part in. The constitution was great and we're sad that we've lost it.\" Communication gap It's unclear how good the chances are of the new constitution being accepted. Despite the image campaign the information is slow to flow. According to recent polls, about 80 percent of the inhabitants in Thailand's twelve largest provinces don't even know when the referendum is taking place. An announcement by the junta chief Sonthi Boonyaratkalin that he was toying with the idea of entering politics was received with deep suspicion. Most Thais are inclined to think that Thailand's recent history has been bloody enough and that the military was largely responsible.",

"story": "Uganda lifts ban on Daily Monitor newspaper and two radio stations Uganda's government has ordered police to allow journalists to return to the premises of a newspaper, which had been shut down for 10 days amid widespread criticism. DW spoke to the Daily Monitor's managing director. Police shut down the Daily Monitor and another paper after they printed a confidential memo by a senior general alleging that President Yoweri Museveni was grooming his son to succeed him. Independent newspaper Daily Monitor faced pressure to reveal how it obtained the letter in which Gen. David Sejusa urged the internal security service to investigate reports that high-ranking officials opposed to the political rise of the president's son were at risk. Sejusa, who is in London at the time and faces arrest if he were to return to Uganda, has said he himself might be targeted. The newspaper has resisted efforts to forward a copy of Sejusa's letter to the police, saying it goes against press freedom. DW: Before the internal affairs minister agreed to withdraw the police cordon around your premises, you had to agree not to publish stories that would cause insecurity or disturb law and order. Such conditions are obviously open to a very broad interpretation and could be easily abused. How worried are you that government interference in the media will continue? Alex Assimwe: What I can say is that we shared our editorial policy guidelines with them which they were not privy to. And in these guidelines they found a breath of fresh air in terms of the journalistic standards we have decided to uphold. And that's the only document that we did share. We did not sign any other undertakings. What exactly was in this memo written by Gen. David Sejusa that made it so sensitive apart from the allegation of nepotism at the highest level? Well from what I do remember is that it that they did say it was an internal security document. I think there were some assassination claims in this letter that Gen. Sejusa wrote to his internal security chief and he acknowledged that it was his letter. So I think their reasoning and understanding is that it touched on national security and they were probably worried that it would create security issues and divisions in the army. How serious is the financial impact of the ten-day closure on your paper? It was serious and it's been serious, but you have to look at the silver lining. To me I think this has come to a close sooner than later; it could have gone on for a longer period. I'm just appreciative that we are now open. I have received so many messages of good will, so much media coverage. The closure of your paper was criticized by the United Nations, the European Union, and various international media watchdogs. Can you assess how much impact this pressure had on the Uganda government? I would never be able to determine accurately how much each of their efforts - or their efforts collectively - what they have done. We appreciate them standing with us and I think it has been useful. The other thing that is that actually sitting down with the government side we did recognize that in spite of the action we had seen outside, there was a very reasonable candid and objective discussion that was going on. But even our wildest fears in terms of them demanding certain things that we are certainly not going to accept - we found a bit less of that. Alex Asiimwe is the Daily Monitor's Managing Director.",

"story": "Brazil Supreme Court seizes anti-Rousseff lawmaker's alleged assets Brazil's lower house speaker has denied allegations he received kickbacks in the Petrobras scandal. A court decision to seize his alleged assets comes after a report denying \"institutional corruption\" at the oil giant. The Brazil Supreme Court this week seized $2.45 million (2.22 million euros) from Swiss accounts allegedly belonging to Chamber of Deputies Speaker Eduardo Cunha, a self-proclaimed enemy of President Dilma Rousseff. According to Justice Teori Zavascki, who approved the request to seize the speaker's funds, Swiss prosecutors provided documents to Brazilian federal prosecutors linking Cunha and his wife to the assets. However, the house speaker denied the allegations, saying he nor his wife own any bank accounts in Switzerland. Brazilian federal prosecutors say that Cunha is suspected in Brazil's largest kickback scandal, comprising more than $2 billion in bribes paid to several executives and politicians. Cunha allegedly assisted companies in building winning contracts with state-run Brazilian Petroleum Corporation (Petrobras) in exchange for millions of dollars in bribes. If the funds are discovered to be linked to kickback schemes, they will returned to the Brazilian treasury, Judge Zavascki added. 'Institutional corruption' non-existent? However, a Brazilian congressional panel on Friday published its final report on an investigation into corruption at Petrobras, concluding that suppliers and rogue employees were responsible for the graft, just shy of absolving politicians of complicity. Instead, the panel said that \"institutional corruption\" was non-existent at Petrobras, adding that police and prosecutors poorly handled Operation Car Wash, a probe into contract fixing, political kickbacks and bribery, with a focus on the oil giant. Rousseff, who served as chairwoman of Petrobras during much of the time the corruption took place, is facing calls from the opposition to resign or face impeachment over her possible involvement in the kickback scheme, though she has yet to be named by prosecutors. Opposition lawmakers allege that she also manipulated public accounts prior to her narrow reelection to boost government spending, a charge that could serve as grounds for impeachment. ls/bw (AP, Reuters, EFE)",

"story": "Storms lash western France, southern England Bad weather overnight to Sunday left thousands of homes in the French region of Brittany without power. In the English Channel, a cargo ship and its crew were rescued after it hit a barge.  Strong winds that lashed France's western and northwestern coast overnight to Sunday left nearly 70,000 homes without power, according to the national electricity grid Enedis. France's national weather agency, Meteo France, said winds that reached up to 160 kilometers (100 miles) per hour battered the Breton peninsula and the Normandy coast, and that two other regions also remained under a storm alert. Power was off in the morning hours in 33,000 homes in Normandy, 18,700 in Brittany and 16,500 in the Loire-Atlantique region south of Brittany, according to Enedis. Local officials said a woman suffered serious injuries when she ran into a fallen tree in her car in Brittany's Cote d'Armor department. Meteo France said the stormy conditions resulted from a rare combination of bad weather in the northeastern Atlantic and a strong airstream directed at northwestern France. The winds were expected to die down on Monday. Media reports said that many trees and roofs were torn down in the violent winds. Ship in distress On the other side of the English Channel, a storm affecting England's south coast has brought a cargo ship into difficulty, British coast guards said on Sunday. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said the 650-foot (200-meter) vessel, carrying 23 people, lost power near the southern port city of Dover, causing it to drift into a rock-laden barge. The agency said a tug was being sent to tow the leaking ship to safety, and that 11 crew members were evacuated by helicopter. Local media reported the name of the ship as the Saga Sky. The storm, called Angus, is the first big one of the autumn-winter season in Britain. Forecasters said the southern coast had been hit by 110 kph winds, with one offshore gust reaching 156 kph. The government issued at least 20 flood warnings. The port of Dover earlier said ferry movements had been temporarily suspended owing to \"very high winds.\" Weather warning in Germany The German Weather Service (DWD) issued a level 2 significant weather warning for the north and northwest of the country valid for Sunday evening and early Monday. DWD warned of squalls packing winds of between 85 and 110 kilometers per hour in parts of Lower Saxony and Schleswig Holstein, as well as the city states of Bremen and Hamburg. On the coastal islands and inlets of the Wadden Sea, the DWD issued a level 3 severe weather warning with wind gusts of up to 100 kilometers an hour. tj/jlw (AP, AFP, Reuters)",

"story": "Fake medicines inundate EU market The EU's outgoing industry commissioner warns that the bloc has been swamped by spurious pharmaceutical products. Guenter Verheugen is calling for steps that will criminalize offenses and protect potential victims. The Industry Commissioner said in an interview published in the German daily Die Welt on Monday that the trade in counterfeit medicines in the European Union had exceeded the body's worst fears. Guenter Verheugen said the EU had seized fake tablets worth millions within a short period of time. \"In just two months, the EU seized 34 million fake tablets at customs points in all member countries. This exceeded our worst fears,\" he said. He told Die Welt that antibiotics, cancer treatments and Viagra were among the counterfeit medicines. Other fake drugs seized included anti-malaria medicines, analgesics and anti-cholesterol treatments. Verheugen is Germany's commissioner to the European Union and will hold the portfolio until commissioner-designate Antonio Tajani of Italy is approved and takes office early next year. Verheugen said the European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, was very concerned about the situation, adding that he expected the EU to take action to fight the menace of fake pharmaceutical products. \"The number of counterfeit medicines arriving in Europe ... is constantly growing. The European Commission is extremely worried,\" Die Welt quoted Verheugen as saying. An EU report in July said that many of the fake pharmaceuticals seized in 2008 came from India. Call to criminalize Verheugen said counterfeiting drugs should be treated as a serious crime and punished severely. \"Every faked drug is a potential massacre,\u201d he said, adding: \"Even when a medicine only contains an ineffective substance, this can lead to people dying because they think they are fighting their illness with a real drug.\" The outgoing EU commissioner expressed optimism that there would be progress in tackling the problem of fake medicines in the coming year. \"I expect the EU will agree in 2010 that a drug's journey from manufacture to sale should be scrutinized carefully. There will also be anti-counterfeit markings on packaging \u2013 in particular a barcode and seal, to show clearly if a package has been opened,\" he said. In June, EU health ministers gave a warm reception to a legal proposal aimed at stopping fake drugs entering the legal supply chain. The plan included stepped-up security measures on packaging, including barcodes, seals and holograms, as well as tighter controls on suppliers. Some analysts have welcomed the proposal, saying it could help to better regulate distributors. rb/AFP/AP/dpa Editor: Kyle James",

"story": "The Sorrows of Young Schiller German icon Friedrich Schiller died 200 years ago on Monday -- an anniversary marked in Weimar with the opening of a special \"Schiller Year.\" The writer died at age 45 and wrote many of his works in physical pain. Managing life's inevitable hardships is a recurring theme in Schiller's works. The artist himself was a prime example as he showed how the mind can triumph over a sick body for most of his life. Schiller's fever attacks often became so severe that rumors of his death spread frequently. But again and again he managed to leave his sick bed and return to the writing desk. \"When he finally died, the duke said, 'Let's cut him open,'\" wrote Schiller's biographer, R\u00fcdiger Safranski. Doctors had long considered the writer a medical phenomenon: Due to his medical history, they felt he should have died much earlier. But \"one should call it idealism, when someone manages to live 10 years longer than the body would permit simply because of the power of enthusiasm and mind,\" Safranski wrote. A dominating duke Schiller was born on Nov. 10, 1759 in Marbach on the Neckar in southwestern Germany. His father worked as an army doctor for Duke Karl Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg. His mother was the daughter of an innkeeper. While in school, Schiller wanted to become a priest, but the duke prevented this. In 1773, he ordered the teenager to attend his military academy. As his father served in the army, it was a request he couldn't refuse. The school turned out to be hell for Schiller, who suffered under the strict regimen. To deal with the pressure, he began to write -- first poems, followed by the play \"The Robbers\" in 1777. While secretly working on the play, he also wrote a medical dissertation. The latter was finished in 1780, the play was published half a year later and finally premiered on Jan. 13, 1783. Schiller's passionate plea for freedom turned \"The Robbers\" into a sensational success and made him the \"poet of peace.\" Fleeing his homeland Needless to say, the duke wasn't thrilled about Schiller's lust for liberty and banned him from writing. Schiller responded by fleeing his homeland in 1782, making his living as a freelance writer from then on. He quickly wrote \"Fiesco,\" \"Love and Intrigue\" and \"Don Carlos\" and crisscrossed Germany -- partly to escape the duke's wrath, partly to find new sources of funding. In 1787, in the eastern German town of Jena, he first learned about Kant's philosophy, which influenced him tremendously. He also met his future wife, Charlotte von Lengefeld, in Jena. The French Revolution of 1789 fascinated Schiller -- after all, it was about liberty. But its bloody course disappointed him and encouraged him to study history. During the following years, he almost completely gave up literary writing and focussed on historical-philosophical research instead. A world-famous friendship In 1790, he settled in Jena, where he taught history at the university. A year later, the newly-wed poet fell ill with pneumonia, which later caused him almost unbearable pain as it led to a suppuration of the pleura, the pericardium and his kidneys. In 1794, Schiller began a friendship with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, which took on a central role in the lives of both poets and became a highlight of Germany's literary history. Goethe encouraged Schiller to write again and together, they composed the famous \"Xenia\" satirical poems. In 1799, Schiller moved to Weimar to be closer to Goethe, only to fall sick again one year later. As a medical doctor, Schiller realized that he didn't have much time left and set out to complete the works that were to make him famous around the globe: \"Wilhelm Tell,\" the Wallenstein trilogy, \"Mary Stuart,\" and the \"Maid of Orleans.\"",

"story": "War Crimes Suspect Karadzic Appears at UN Tribunal Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has made his first appearance before a UN war crimes tribunal to answer genocide charges. He opted to delay his plea for 30 days and announced he would conduct his own defense. Karadzic, who was no longer sporting the beard and long hair that helped him conceal his identity for over a decade, waived his right to representation during the hearing on Thursday, July 31. When Judge Alphons Orie noted that he was alone, the wartime leader smiled and responded, \"I have an invisible adviser, but I have decided to defend myself.\" Orie, who said he expected the trial to last for many months, gave Karadzic 30 days to decide a plea at the initial hour-long hearing of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. The trial was adjourned until Aug. 29. Repeat performance? Karadzic said that -- like his former ally -- he intends to defend himself throughout the rest of the trial. Slobodan Milosevic, who was accused of crimes against humanity for his role in the Bosnian wars, used this as a delaying tactic to drag out his trial at the criminal tribunal in The Hague for years, dying in 2006 before it ended. Karadzic, who is the most prominent Balkans war crimes suspect to be arrested after Milosevic, said on Thursday that he would also reveal \"numerous irregularities\" related to his presence at the hearing. \"I will inform the court of the many mistakes and irregularities, like the mistaken date of my arrest,\" the 63-year-old said. He claimed that under the Dayton Accord, which ended the Bosnian war and brokered by former US Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke, an agreement was made that he would not be brought to trial if he withdrew from public life. Orie interrupted the former Bosnian Serb leader when he tried to read a prepared four-page statement about this, and said he should send the information to the court in writing. Chief prosecutor Serge Brammetz said lessons had been learned from the Milosevic case. \"Of course, it will take some months before the prosecution and defense will be ready to start,\" he told reporters. \"It will be a complex trial, but we are fully aware of the importance of being efficient.\" Some observers say he is likely to use the trial to illuminate claims that a shady deal with the West helped him avoid detention for so long. \"This is a political man, a former poet, he likes being the center of attention,\" international justice expert Heikelina Verrijn Stuart told AFP news agency. Charges include siege and massacre atrocities During Thursday's hearing, Orie read out the 11 war crimes charges that were first leveled against Karadzic in 1995. The majority of the charges against Karadzic focus on his role in the siege of Sarajevo and the Srebrenica massacre. Some 8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed in the UN safe haven of Srebrenica, while the siege of Sarajevo, which lasted over three years, is estimated to have left some 10,000 people dead. If convicted of the crimes, Karadzic faces life imprisonment.",

"story": "Baltic Beach Battle The Baltic Sea stretching from eastern Germany to Poland used to be a Mecca for beach bums who prefer skin to skivvies, but is an onslaught of prudish Western visitors spoiling the tradition? Back in the days of Communism, as many as 90 percent of beach-goers along the East German-controlled stretch of the Baltic Sea preferred to bathe in their birthday suits, au natural. Fifteen years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it's a different story. Today, officials are buckling under pressure from tourists from western Germany who have demanded the nudists, known here as Free Body Culture (FKK), be pushed to the fringes of public beaches. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the tensions have pitted the nudes against the prudes. \"I grew up being naked at the beach and it's the only way to spend the summer here,\" Susanne Koch, 31, told Reuters. \"Being nude on the beach feels completely normal.\" To cover or uncover? The dispute, unfortunately, has also tapped into divisions between the eastern Germans and their western German neighbors, who sometimes pejoratively refer to each other as \"Ossis\" and \"Wessis.\" \"Western tourists are ruining the atmosphere,\" Koch said. \"The tensions are unfortunate. They don't know what they're missing, It's a shame westerners are so intolerant.\" But the resort town of Warnem\u00fcnde, a coastal outpost near Rostock, is one of many in the area that reply heavily on tourism for its survival. Officials in the town have divided the beaches between \"textile\" areas and \"FKK\" sections. And there are even reported incidents of nudists taking one false step and winding up with a handful of sand in their faces. Keen to cash in on their higher spending power, tourism officials have sought to appease visitors from the west like Dirk Richter of the central western city of Hanover. \"I really don't want to see naked bodies all around me,\" he said. \"It's not for everyone and it's often not a very attractive sight. It's tough luck for the natives if that's the way it used to be. Times change.\" But few believe the nudists will go without a fight -- including people like Maron Mock. \"It's not fair,\" the 25-year-old primary school teacher said. \"We're being pushed off our own beach into a crummy little zone on the edge. Being nude is not a crime!\"",

"story": "CeBIT attempts to regain former glory Google, cloud computing, 3D computer screens and intelligent houses that can tell you how to live and how to save money: CeBIT 2010 is a technophile's playground. Deutsche Welle takes a look around. The world's largest IT and telecommunications trade fair, CeBIT, has opened in the northern German city of Hanover. More than 4,000 companies from 68 countries are on hand to showcase their wares. Among them, for the first time ever, is the American internet giant Google, which has been causing some controversy in Germany with its plans to launch Street View. Sam Edmonds, Deutsche Welle's business editor and host of European Business Week, is in Hanover, and had a look around. Google's debut Google is basically here at CeBIT to fly the flag. It's been under a lot of pressure, not just from the German government, but the French government as well, due to the library plans Google has for digitizing all kinds of books and making them available online. So basically they're using CeBIT as an opportunity to put themselves out there and explain what they see as the benefits of Street View and other products like that. CeBIT strives to regain its status I think to bounce back this year CeBIT is actually looking to get consumers back into the fairgrounds, i.e. private people just interested in the latest gizmos. CeBIT began as a very expert-oriented computer and information technology fair and it was only around the late 90s as we were getting into the dot com boom at the turn of the millennium that CeBIT really grew into this massive monster. At its height, there were 800,000 people visiting the fairground. They've now done a 180 degree turn. They're trying to get consumers in, but instead of calling them consumers, they figure that if they call them prosumers \u2013 i.e. very discerning consumers who are quite knowledgeable about the equipment they're looking to buy \u2013 that perhaps it won't be as bad as it was in previous years. Futuristic housing There are quite a few things I'm eager to check out personally. I'd say one of them would definitely have to be a futuristic apartment, which they've got set up in Hall 9. It's about 400 square meters (4,300 square feet) with a living room, a kitchen and even a gym. It's really looking at using computer systems and IT for better living in the future, which includes greener living. There's a computer system that optimizes your lighting and heating to try and be as efficient as possible in energy terms. In the kitchen there's a digital kitchen hand that will give you advice on what you're cooking and whether it's healthy and part of a balanced diet. If that doesn't work, there's a digital fitness trainer that will basically tell you to go to the gym, and will give you some advice on what you should be doing to get those pounds off. The future of 3D technology There a quite a few companies and manufacturers that are releasing 3D screens for their laptop and desktop computers. They have a special coating, so if you do have 3D glasses on, you can get a very different feeling of depth perception. This laptop technology isn't anywhere near what you're going to see if you watch movies like Avatar but it's not too bad. What is particularly interesting is that gamers will be looking at this technology as a way of intensifying their gaming experience. This technology, especially for home computers, is only being rolled out now. I know from cinemas that a lot of people say that for the first 10 to 20 minutes it's a bit difficult to get used to but I guess time will tell with what will happen to the computers.

"story": "German Left stalwart Gregor Gysi to run for Bundestag Gregor Gysi, a Left party veteran renowned for his rhetoric, says he'll run again for parliament next year. He says Chancellor Merkel's conservatives must be voted into opposition to make the right-wing AfD superfluous. Gysi, who stood down as the opposition Left's parliamentary group leader last year after a 10-year tenure, said Thursday that his party must again strive for an alliance with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens. In an apparent bid to reassure the Left's younger heads, Gysi said he was \"pulling on the same rope\" as co-leaders Katja Kipping and Bernd Riexinger and its leading Bundestag parliamentarians Sahra Wagenknecht and Dietmar Bartsch. \"Angela Merkel has undone solidarity in Europe like no other chancellor before,\" Gysi told the Berlin Kurier newspaper, adding that he would only stand as a direct candidate in his Berlin electorate of Treptow-K\u00f6penick. \"The protest against Merkel must be channeled in the correct direction so that finally something can develop positively in this country,\" he said. Germany and Europe needed \"a different, a social, a peaceful and democratic political agenda,\" he said. That could only be achieved with a strong left, capable of relegating Merkel's CDU/CSU conservatives into the opposition and thereby making superfluous the upstart Alternative for Germany (AfD), he asserted. Gysi said he reached his decision after \"careful consideration,\" prompted by \"requests and signals,\" particularly from within his own electorate. His announcement precedes Berlin city-state's election due on Sunday. Gysi, who was a lawyer in former communist East Germany before being first elected to the Bundestag in 1990, had until Thursday stayed mute on whether he would run again. Two weeks ago, Gysi accused Merkel's coalition government - comprising her conservatives and the center-left SPD under Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel - of distancing itself from the German federal parliament's condemnation of Turkey's World War One massacre of Armenians. Berlin-Ankara ties plunged after that resolution. ipj/kms (AFP, dpa)",

"story": "Rapper XXXTentacion shot dead in Florida US star rapper XXXTentacion, who attracted controversy after multiple accusations of domestic violence and allegations about hateful music, has been shot dead in Florida in connection with an apparent robbery.  Rapper XXXTentacion, whose real name was Jahseh Onfroy, was shot dead Monday afternoon as he was leaving a motorcycle dealership in Deerfield Beach. The Broward County sheriff's office said two suspects had approached him as he was departing the store. \"At least one of the suspects fired a gun striking Onfroy. Both of the suspects fled in a dark-color SUV. Investigators say it appears to be a possible robbery,\" the sheriff's office said in a statement posted to its Twitter account. The 20-year-old was pronounced dead at nearby Broward Health North hospital. Despite \u2014 or perhaps because of \u2014 his grim and sometimes suicidal lyrics, XXXTentacion catapulted to the top of US charts just months ago. Bleak outlook XXXTentacion released his first song on Soundcloud in 2014. His debut album, 17, came out last August. His second album, entitled ?, debuted at the top of the Billboard album chart in March, despite a lack of traditional promotion. Kanye West tweeted a tribute on Monday, saying he was grateful to the young rapper \"for existing.\" \"Rest in peace. I never told you how much you inspired me when you were here,\" West posted on Twitter.

He spent time in youth detention in 2014 for gun possession, followed by imprisonment in 2016 for robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. Soon after release, he was again arrested on charges that he attacked his girlfriend, who was pregnant at the time. In an interview published earlier this month in the Miami New Times, the former girlfriend said that the emerging star rapper had subjected her to a summer of abuse in 2016 that included physical attacks every few days, as well as threats of sexual violence. Despite a big fan following, XXXTentacion faced criticism from those who said his alleged mistreatment of women should be a career-stopper in a time when the #MeToo movement is demanding higher standards from men. Read more: Global Media Forum 2018: #MeToo, beyond the Hollywood bubble Last month, music streaming service Spotify singled out the rapper's music as part of a policy not to promote songs by artists known for \"harmful or hateful\" behavior. However, Spotify backpedaled after charges that it had overstepped its role.

"story": "Poland swears in Komorowski as new president Bronislaw Komorowski has been sworn in for a five-year term as Poland's president, promising greater inter-party cooperation and improved relations with the European Union, the United States and Russia. One month after winning a runoff snap election, liberal Civic Platform leader Bronislaw Komorowski took the oath of office for Poland's presidency in a ceremony at parliament in Warsaw on Friday. In his inauguration speech, the 58-year-old said Poland needed more cooperation between the various branches of government as well as among political parties. \"Only we can determine if the inevitable disagreements dig valleys between us, or if we lead a democratic debate while upholding mutual respect and concern for priorities,\" he said. He promised to modernize Poland's infrastructure and to improve ties with the United States, NATO, the European Union and EU hopefuls like Ukraine. Addressing Poland's relationship with Russia, which has worsened since the signing of a missile defense shield deal between the United States and Poland, Komorowski said \"there will be no stable development of our region without working together with Russia. Rival a no-show Notably absent from the ceremony was Komorowski's rival Jaroslaw Kaczynski, identical twin to late president Lech Kaczynski, whose death in a plane crash in April caused the snap election. Kaczynski's absence drew criticism from several politicians, including former center-right prime minister and current European Parliament President Jerzy Buzek. \"There are certain events in a democratic state when all should be present, and when their absence is regarded as a deliberate protest,\" Buzek said. A spokesman for Kaczynski's conservative Law and Justice party defended the party leader's absence. \"Civic Platform politicians made brutal verbal attacks on President Lech Kaczynski when he was alive, and some continue to do so even after his death,\" Mariusz Blaszczak told AFP news agency. Komorowski is Poland's fourth democratically-elected president since the fall of communism in 1989, an event which he worked toward as part of the pro-democracy Solidarity movement.

"story": "Polish Nobel Laureate Lech Walesa admits to 'mistake' after spy accusations Former Polish President Lech Walesa has denied cooperating with Communist intelligence agencies during the Soviet era. He did, however, admit to making a \"mistake.\" In an entry on his blog on Friday, Lech Walesa denied all accusations of working with security agencies while Poland was a Soviet satellite state. \"I did not cooperate with the security agency. I did not take any money,\" Walesa wrote, adding that he had made a \"mistake.\" He added that he would not reveal details of the \"mistake.\" \"There is a person - a perpetrator, who is still alive who should reveal the truth and I'm counting on it. I had a soft heart,\" the Nobel Laureate said in his microblog. Walesa's comments came a day after Lukasz Kaminski, director of Poland's National Remembrance Institute (IPN), reported about a secret service document signed by Walesa. The IPN is responsible for prosecuting Communist-era crimes. The paper included a commitment to provide information from 1970-1976 and had been signed by Walesa under the codename \"Bolek.\" However, IPN's Kaminski said on Thursday that every historical document had to be verified and an authentic intelligence agency document did not necessarily mean that its content was true. Walesa, currently on a trip to Venezuela, admitted he had signed a commitment to be an informant during the 1970s, but said he never acted on it. A special court cleared him of charges of collaboration 16 years ago. The 72-year-old leader is best known for launching the workers' party Solidarity in 1980, against the wishes of the Communist regime. He served as Poland's first post-Communist president from 1990 to 1995. The leader is still politically active and launched a scathing attack against the government last year, calling for early elections. mg/sms (dpa, AP, AFP)",

"story": "Terror attack arrests in Paris as US' Kerry visits France to pay respects US diplomat John Kerry meeting top officials in Paris says his country shares France\u2019s pain over last week\u2019s Islamist attacks. Kerry's visit comes as French authorities arrest a dozen people in relation to the violence. US Secretary of State John Kerry met with top officials in Paris Friday to convey America's solidarity with France after the deadly terrorist attacks last week. \"I know you know that we share the pain and the horror of everything that you went through,\" said Kerry as he met the president, referring to the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US. \"We share this pain and that is also the sense of our meeting today, as well as the friendship it displays\u2026We must work together to find the necessary response,\" he added. Kerry met earlier on Friday with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius at the French foreign ministry, explaining he could not have attended last Sunday's unity marches in Paris as he was on a scheduled trip to India. \"It's good to be with you,\" Kerry said on his arrival. \"We have a lot to talk about.\" The Obama administration came under fire for failing to send a cabinet-level official to the French capital for the rally. More than 40 world leaders, including Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, and a million demonstrators gathered in solidarity for the march on Sunday night. Kerry met with Fabius and Hollande before laying wreaths at the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket. Kerry, who announced he was in France \"to share a big hug with Paris,\" will meet the capital's mayor later in the day to express his sympathy. Meanwhile, a dozen people were arrested Friday morning in connection with last week's terror attacks in Paris that left 17 people dead. Nine men, and three women were arrested, French daily Le Monde reported Friday, citing an unnamed judicial source. Paris\u2019 Gare de I\u2019Est train station was evacuated at 8 a.m. local time (0700 UTC) after a bomb scare. It re-opened an hour later, the SNCF state railway said, without giving further details. jlw/kms (AP, AFP, dpa)",

Merkel said that despite differences the two neighbors' policies align. Merkel said in her weekly podcast that the French invitation to attend the ceremonies honoring the dead from Battle of Verdun highlighted the degree of trust and cooperation between two neighbors that fought two bloody wars in the 20th century. \"To be invited to these commemorations shows the extent to which relations between France and Germany are good today,\" said Merkel, who will join French President Francois Hollande on Sunday at Verdun to remember the 350,000 killed in senseless fighting during one of the bloodiest battles of WWI. The German Chancellor said the Franco-German experience of working to build a united Europe showed that despite occasional differences of opinion compromises can be forged. She cited cooperation during the euro-crisis as an example. \"Again and again Germany and France have a common position,\" Merkel said. The comments come as France and Germany seek to tackle persistent economic woes, the bloc's border security, counter terrorism, and prevent a British exit from the EU, among other issues. \"Europe faces difficult tasks, there is no doubt about that,\" the German leader said. \"Europe has problems, but Europe has also done and achieved many things.\" cw/jm (AFP, dpa)",

"story": "Afghan unity government in jeopardy as presidential candidate rejects vote audit Afghan candidate, Abdullah Abdullah, says he will not accept the \"fraudulent\" results of the presidential run-off. His announcement dashed hopes for a national unity government with his opponent, Ashraf Ghani. The Afghan election commission is expected to announce the results of the second round of the presidential elections later this week following a vote audit monitored by the United Nations. The stalemate over alleged fraud in the June 14 vote has raised fears of renewed violence in the South Asian country. Abdullah said on Monday he believed he won both rounds of the polls. \"We were the winners of the election,\" Abdullah told his supporters. \"We do not accept fraudulent election results, and we will not accept a fraudulent government for one day,\" he added. While he acknowledged the \"necessity\" of a unity government, Abdullah said \"the political process had been deadlocked\" due to differences over government posts and the division of powers. Officials from both camps say there are two key impediments to forming a unity government: \"The role and power of the proposed chief executive position and the manner in which the audit results are announced, these are the two issues,\" said Mujib Rahimi, an advisor to Abdullah. Abdullah - who won the first round of the elections but failed to win a clear majority - had rejected the initial results of the second round won by his rival Ghani. The feuding candidates agreed to form a national unity government after US Secretary of State John Kerry held separate talks with them. Kerry also brokered an agreement for a UN-supervised audit of the 8.1 million votes cast in the runoff. Ghani's camp made no immediate response to Abdullah's speech. Obama's phone call The US wants an immediate end to the Afghan political impasse. Washington hopes that the new president would sign the pending Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA), which allows the US to keep some of its troops in the country after the scheduled withdrawal of NATO forces by the end of this year. US President Barack Obama telephoned the two candidates over the weekend and urged them to finalize the deal. \"The president emphasized the importance of concluding a deal on the national unity government as soon as possible in the interest of shoring up international support for Afghanistan and preserving Afghan stability,\" the White House press office said in a statement on Saturday. shs/ksb (AP, dpa, AFP)",

"story": "Berlin sees bad news as Davutoglu resigns in Turkey Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu was thought of as more than just a reliable partner to Germany's federal government. Many in Berlin see a reason for concern in his resignation. Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, the leader of the Bundestag's foreign policy committee and a member of the Christian Democrats (CDU), called Ahmet Davutoglu's resignation announcement bad news for Europe and for Turkey. The prime minister also plans to step down from his position as Justice and Development Party (AKP) leader at a special party congress in two weeks' time. Davutoglu had taken over the position of head of the party and the government from Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who had been elected president in 2014. The 57-year-old Davutoglu was always considered to be a close and loyal confidant of Erdogan's. Now it seems he has fallen from grace: Tensions have risen between the two over the past couple of weeks as Davutoglu voiced opposition to his mentor's plans to introduce a new system that would expand the president's - that is Erdogan's - power. Erdogan's supporters accuse Davutoglu of attempting to undermine the president's authority. Germany is losing an important negotiating partner. Davutoglu led negotiations between the European Union and Turkey on a controversial deportations pact, and he and Chancellor Angela Merkel are seen as the architects of the EU-Turkey refugee plan that resulted. 'A warning' Katrin G\u00f6ring-Eckardt, the parliamentary chair for the Greens, now sees Turkey's cooperation with the EU as threatened. \"Ultimately, Mr. Davutoglu was a reliable partner for the Europeans, and he was someone who sought to open Turkey toward Europe,\" she said Friday morning on German public television. \"Obviously the same cannot be said about Mr. Erdogan.\" The German federal government, however, played down the situation: Acting spokesman Georg Streiter said he assumed that constructive cooperation would continue. \"The EU-Turkey agreement stands,\" Streiter said, adding that the deal was made between the European Union and Turkey - not between the EU and Davutoglu. In a press statement released Thursday, J\u00fcrgen Hardt, foreign policy speaker for the CDU/Christian Social Union parliamentary group, wrote that Davutoglu's resignation \"increases fears that President Erdogan is intent on transforming Turkey's democracy into an authoritarian presidential state.\" He added that restrictions directed at the press and opposition as well as an increasing number of civilians enlisted in the fight against the Kurdish Workers' Party are \"a warning to all democratic and pro-European forces in Turkey.\" The Left warned that Turkey's democracy could descend into \"despotism\": \"It does not matter who is prime minister under Erdogan,\" said Sevim Dagdelen, the foreign policy speaker of the Left parliamentary group. \"This is about cementing Erdogan's absolute power.

"story": "Turkey riles NATO with Chinese whispers Turkey is sending mixed signals over whether it will buy a multi-billion dollar anti-missile defense system from NATO allies or China. Turkey's posturing could backfire, writes Jacob Resneck from Istanbul. Turkey's announcement in 2013 that it had accepted a $3.4 billion (2.9 billion euros) bid from a blacklisted Chinese company sent shockwaves to its western allies because the system would be incompatible with existing infrastructure by linking up with a rival military power. \"NATO will never allow a Chinese system to be linked to its own infrastructure for fear of China could then discover the underlying logistics, could use it for cyber attacks and things like that,\" said former Turkish diplomat Sinan Ulgen, now an analyst with the Center for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies in Istanbul. \"So it's not just a matter of technological compatibility - it's much more than that.\" In a written response to parliamentary questions, Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Yilmaz suggested that the Chinese system was being actively considered despite its inoperability with NATO's existing systems. \"The system in question will be integrated with the national system for Turkey's defense and will be used without integrating with NATO,\" Yilmaz wrote Thursday. Hours later a senior defense procurement official clarified that no final decision had been made but the implication is clear: Turkey is willing to openly irritate its traditional allies to leverage what it wants: technology transfers, discounts on equipment and respect as an indispensable regional power. Having it both ways One theory is that Turkey may try to buy components from several sources - the US consortium of Raytheon and Lockheed and/or the Franco-Italian firm Eurosam - and still use Chinese components. \"In return Turkey could possibly get some of the technology transfers it seeks,\" Ulgen said. Earlier reports suggested Turkey was postponing the decision until after April 24 when ethnic Armenians around the world will commemorate the 100th anniversary of the purging of ethnic Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. Turkey reportedly planned to use the lucrative defense contract as leverage over the US and European nations not to commemorate what many historians consider the 20th century's first genocide. \"The (defense) minister's announcement looked more political than technical to me,\" said veteran defense journalist Burak Bekdil who says his sources indicate that Turkey plans to use the missile defense contract as leverage over its longstanding dispute over the Armenian debate. The Chinese way China Precision Machinery Import and Export Corp's bid is not only cheaper but includes more technology transfers than the European and American systems which appeals to Turkey's strategy of developing its own military systems independent of its NATO allies. \"Turkish officials do not take seriously the threat of American and Western companies, and it seems like they will be out of the deal as long as they don't meet Turkey's demands concerning technology transfers,\" journalist Ali Unal wrote last year in the pro-government Daily Sabah newspaper. That's been a theme in increasingly strident speeches by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan who argues that Turkey has the right to a diverse arsenal. \"If NATO is so sensitive on this subject, many countries which are currently NATO members still have Russian weapons in their inventories,\" Erdogan told reporters in 2013. Much of this could be posturing, though the stakes for Turkey's long-term security are high, says Gareth Jenkins, an Istanbul-based researcher with the Silk Road Institute at John Hopkins University who notes it's not the first time Ankara and Beijing have flirted with closer military ties. \"Erdogan wants to demonstrate that Turkey is now a great power and it can do what it wants,\" Jenkins said. \"I think he sees this - as well as the price advantage - as an opportunity for macho posturing which has come to dominate so many of his statements.\" Posture at your peril But defense analysts warn that Turkey is still years - if not decades - away from military independence and runs many risks by alienating its traditional allies. \"If Turkey decides to go for a stand-alone system its long range air defense architecture will have to be deprived of NATO and US assets stationed on Turkish soil,\" Bekdil noted. \"In short, it cannot be an efficient architecture without those assets.\" That's because Turkey continues to be heavily reliant on NATO's hardware - currently a battery of Spanish Patriot missiles are deployed on the Syrian border to defend Turkey from cruise missiles based in Syria. That leaves many questions of where Ankara's priorities lie. Many geopolitical factors are in play as Turkey flirts with traditional allies and rivals alike. \"If Turkey decides to go for the Chinese solution it will have a big message to its NATO allies: that Turkey can only be relied upon as a part-time ally, rather than just an ally,\" Bekdil said. \"It will be a bold Turkish challenge against the West, especially the US.\"",

"story": "What alchemy and art have in common Alchemists and artists alike are highly ingenious, transforming materials and creating their own worlds and realities. A Berlin show now throws some light on how they have mutually inspired each other over centuries.  In a way, they are artists. That's the topic explored by the large-scale exhibition \"Alchemy. The Great Art,\" which runs from April 6 to July 23, 2017, in Berlin's Kulturforum. The foreword of the exhibition's program explains that alchemy is a creation myth and therefore intimately related to artistic practice. Berlin's Kulturforum can be seen as predestined location for such a show, as the Berlin state museums and the Berlin state library contain a myriad of items representing 3,000 years of art and cultural history. The exhibition was also supplemented by loans from international institutions. From Ancient Egypt to Joseph Beuys On show are 200 exhibits, ranging from items of Ancient Egyptian temples and writings of the early modern era to works of contemporary artists including Anselm Kiefer, Yves Klein and Joseph Beuys. As the permanent transformation of materials is part of Beuys' work, he actually sees himself as part of the alchemist tradition. Alchemy, the art of metallurgy For thousands of years, alchemists have searched for the stone of the wise, a technique for transforming raw metals into precious ones, particularly gold. According to a legend, the deity Hermes Trismegistos engraved the formula for the creation of the stone of the wise into an emerald panel 2,500 years ago. According to that formula, the legendary stone of the wise was to be created by combining the four basic elements - namely fire, water, earth and air - with quicksilver, sulfur and salt. The term \"alchemy\" itself originated in Ancient Greece and signified something like \"metal casting.\" During the Middle Ages, alchemy was referred to as \"Ars Magna\" in Europe. Not surprisingly therefore, the \"great art\" was also seen as serving artistic endeavors. The mysterious stories surrounding alchemists portray them either as cranky and crazy, or as wise and omniscient. Even if nowadays they are much ridiculed for their superstitious spirituality, alchemists were once the precursors of modern chemistry and pharmacology. Creation, creator and creature The exhibition \"Alchemy. The Great Art\" is divided in three sections showing how alchemists and artists have mutually influenced and enriched each other. The section \"Creation\" focuses on the origins of alchemy, as well as the influence of alchemist techniques on art. The section \"Creator\" illustrates the influence of alchemists, and their pursuit of creative power. The section \"Creature\" presents the successful transformation of raw materials into precious materials, as well as the creation of artworks. Click through the gallery above to see a selection of the works on show at the exhibition.",

"story": "Dutch Government Collapse Brings EU Enlargement Jitters With the clock ticking for the European Union\u2019s expansion in 2004, the crisis in The Hague could derail the whole process. EU leaders, however, are putting on a brave face. Brussels is trying to reassure the 10 countries waiting to join the European Union that the collapse of the Dutch government barely a week before a key EU summit will not upset the bloc's plans for eastern enlargement. The Prime Minister Jan-Peter Balkenende's center-right coalition resigned on Wednesday over a feud within one of the three member parties. The government had been in office for less than 100 days. The issue of EU enlargement was a key factor in the break-up. In a cabinet row last Friday, Balkenende\u2019s two junior coalition partners, the liberal VVD party and the anti-immigration List Pim Fortuyn (LPF), both opposed the admission of Poland, Slovakia and Cyprus to the EU in 2004. Caretaker government has authority to vote A caretaker government will run the country for the time being. Constitutional experts in the Netherlands insist it will have the legal authority to participate fully in next week's Brussels summit, which is due to approve the new members\u2019 accession and agree on the terms for financing enlargement. Caretaker cabinets are expected to refrain from decisions on \"controversial\" subjects but can interpret this flexibly and have done so in the past. With Ireland due to hold a referendum on enlargement on Saturday, the political crisis in The Hague has added to diplomatic tensions within the EU. But Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who currently holds the EU\u2019s rotating presidency, said he did not believe it would prove an obstacle. The EU hopes to close accession talks with the 10 candidate states at a summit in Copenhagen in December. European Commission statement points to concern EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen also put on a brave face, saying he thought it unlikely the Dutch would overturn decisions which had already been taken. However, the Commission has taken the unusual step of issuing a statement commenting on the political situation in a member state. \"Obviously it is up to the Netherlands to decide, in the current situation, whether or not they can take a position on the next steps of the enlargement process and if so, which position,\" it said. Some Dutch politicians, including members of the outgoing government, have criticized the scale and estimated cost of enlargement, but EU diplomats said they were confident a broad majority in the Dutch parliament backed it.",

"story": "HSBC roars back from costly write-downs London-based banking giant HSBC has said its huge restructuring drive is finally bearing fruit. The behemoth has seen its profit rise in recent months thanks first and foremost to its brisk Asia business. Pre-tax profits at HSBC leapt fivefold in the third quarter, the company reported Monday. The massive jump came weeks after a new chief executive was unveiled as part of a management overhaul that has seen the banking behemoth deal with costly write-downs. John Flint, head of retail banking and wealth management, will take up his position in February next year when current CEO Stuart Gulliver steps down in a bid to \"accelerate the pace of change.\" The Asia-focused lender has been on a recovery drive to streamline its business and slash costs since 2015 when it set out a plan to axe 50,000 jobs and exit non-core markets as it also navigated a series of damaging probes. Among other things, HSBC was fined by US prosecutors for failing to enforce anti-money laundering rules, exposing it to exploitation by drug cartels and terrorist organizations. Uncertainties remain \"HSBC has had to spend a lot of money to hire more lawyers to help it fix legal problems and enhance its compliance department,\" said Kingston Securities Executive Director Dickie Wong, adding that it may still feel the effects of legal challenges and expenses. But given the lender's third-quarter performance, Wong insisted HSBC was \"one of the best international banking stocks at this moment.\" Q3 net earnings also rose to $2.96 billion (2.55 billion euros), up from a loss of $617 million in the same quarter a year earlier. \"Our pivot to Asia is driving higher returns and lending growth, particularly in Hong Kong,\" CEO Stuart Gulliver said in a statement Monday. hg/jd (AFP, Reuters, dpa)",

"story": "Merkel: Mediterranean deaths 'incompatible with EU values' German politicians have urged better financing for sea rescues and fair distribution of refugees across the EU. EU leaders are set to discuss how to stop migrant tragedies in the Mediterranean at a special summit. Wednesday's discussion in the Bundestag, the lower house of German parliament, began with representatives standing in a gesture of mourning for the hundreds of people who drowned in the Mediterranean Sea over the weekend. In a cabinet session earlier Wednesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel made clear that \"images of drowned people are incompatible with the values of the European Union,\" deputy government spokeswoman Christiane Wirtz said in Berlin, adding that the EU's first priority must be saving human lives. European leaders have faced criticism this week for their policies towards people from Africa, Asia and the Middle East embarking on perilous journeys to reach Europe - fleeing conflict, persecution and poverty. An estimated 800 people drowned Sunday when the overcrowded boat they were in sank off the coast of Libya. According to the International Organization for Migration, more than 1,750 people have drowned so far this year in the Mediterranean Sea, trying to get to EU territory. The discussion in the Bundestag comes ahead of a special EU meeting called for Thursday in Brussels, where member states' leaders will discuss a 10-point plan including expanding sea rescue efforts, action against people smugglers and how to better distribute refugees across the EU for resettlement. Warning against expecting quick solutions German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told the Bundestag that Europe could not shirk its responsibility to the migrants, while at the same time warning against expecting quick solutions. \"Effort, time and investment\" were necessary to stabilize the situation in transit countries such as Libya, he said. He also pointed to the need for greater efficiency in tackling criminal bands of people smugglers. He said it was right for the EU to double its current emergency sea rescue operations. German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere also considered the sea rescues as an urgent priority, reacting positively to the suggestion of doubling the funding for sea rescues. \"It could also be tripled,\" he said, adding that \"migration is not allowed to become a question of life and death.\" Tripling the budget for the Triton border protection program would bring it close to - but not quite equal to - the former funding level of Mare Nostrum, the Italian sea rescue operation. That rescue program was launched in response to mass migrant deaths off the island of Lampedusa in October 2013. Mare Nostrum, however, was canceled late last year as some politicians said it created an incentive for migrants to take to unseaworthy vessels and risk their lives crossing the Mediterranean. The current EU mission, called Triton, has been billed as its partial replacement for Mare Nostrum, but its mandate was more limited in scope and centered on border protection, not rescue. De Maiziere also discussed measures for destroying what he called the \"deadly boats\" used by people smugglers. He also called for refugees to be distributed more evenly across the 28-member EU. Opposition Green party whip Katrin G\u00f6ring-Eckardt called for means to enable people to flee legally to Europe so people smugglers would not be needed. \"We need safe corridors,\" she said. se/sms (AFP, dpa, epd)",

"story": "Pakistan hands over Taliban prisoners to Afghans Pakistan has released several Afghan Taliban prisoners to \"facilitate the peace process\" in Afghanistan. However, experts say this should not be mistaken for a change in Islamabad's Afghanistan policy. Pakistani officials said on Wednesday that the government had decided to free several Afghan Taliban prisoners in order to bolster peace efforts in neighboring Afghanistan. \"A group of Afghan Taliban has been released and they are accessible to anyone who wants to contact them,\" a Pakistani foreign ministry official told the German news agency, dpa. The news was confirmed on Thursday after a series of meetings in Islamabad between Afghan peace mediators Pakistan's top leaders and religious figures. A joint statement issued said the negotiating parties had agreed to cooperate to allow safe passage for \"potential negotiators amongst Taliban\" to attend future talks. Dozens of mid-level and senior Taliban commanders - who fled to Pakistan after the NATO forces attacked Afghanistan and toppled the Taliban regime in 2001 - are being held in Pakistani jails. The decision to release Taliban prisoners came during the meetings between Afghanistan's High Peace Council delegation - led by Salahauddin Rabbani - and Pakistani authorities in Islamabad. The Afghan peace delegation - which arrived in Islamabad on Monday on a three-day visit - met with Pakistan's civilian and military leadership to discuss ways to persuade the Taliban militants to end the decade-long insurgency in Afghanistan. Reconciliation efforts The Afghan Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid told dpa that it was \"too soon to comment\" on Islamabad's decision. \"The Islamic Emirates (the Taliban's name for Afghanistan) will announce its reaction soon after the decision of the leadership meeting.\" The number of freed Taliban leaders is said to be less than a dozen and it does not include Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban's former deputy leader. Baradar was arrested in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi in February 2010. The Afghan government believes that Baradar can influence the Taliban to join the Afghan government-led peace talks. So far, the Taliban have rejected the negotiation offers. \"We aren't too certain whether they (the released Taliban leaders) can play an important role in peace negotiations but it is a positive gesture from Pakistan in helping peace efforts,\" an Afghan official told the Reuters news agency. The Afghan government and the US are trying to hold separate peace talks with the Afghan Taliban in the hopes of finding a peaceful solution to the decade-long war. The US is winding up its operations in Afghanistan against Islamist militants and NATO troops are scheduled to withdraw from the war-torn country in 2014. Bargaining chip Afghanistan has long criticized Pakistan for not giving it access to imprisoned members of the Taliban leadership. The Afghan government and the US accuse Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI) of supporting its favorite Taliban factions to use them as a bargaining chip while dealing with Kabul and Washington. Experts say that, despite the fact that Islamabad has agreed to hand over some Taliban leaders to Afghan authorities, it is unlikely that it is going to abandon its policy of maintaining strategic influence in Afghanistan through the Taliban. Dr. Naeem Ahmed, professor of International Relations at Karachi University, told DW that Pakistan wanted \"to see a bigger role for the Taliban in Afghanistan.\" \"Washington and Kabul also want to take the Taliban on board, and they are already conducting secret talks with some of their factions, but they want to exclude Pakistan from these negotiations,\" he added. \"That is not going down well with Islamabad.\" Islamabad-based defense analyst Tahir Khan told DW that there were several unresolved issues between the two uneasy neighbors. \"The Afghan government demands that Pakistan must give access to detained Taliban leaders so that its officials could talk to them directly,\" Khan said, adding that the Afghan government had always accused Pakistan of assassinating the Taliban leaders that were willing to negotiate with Afghanistan. A U-turn? Dr. Moonis Ahmar, professor of International Relations at Karachi University, told DW that peace efforts in Afghanistan were in Pakistan's own interest. He said that Pakistan did not want to see a civil war in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of NATO troops from the country in 2014. For that reason, Ahmar said, Pakistani authorities had been trying to use their influence on some \"moderate Taliban leaders\" to engage in talks with the Afghan government and the US. \"It is not clear on what terms and conditions these Taliban leaders are being released,\" Ahmar said. \"The Afghan government has clearly said that it will only talk to the Taliban if they agree to certain rules and abandon the use of violence. I am not sure that those who are being freed have agreed to these terms.\" Ahmar also told DW that Saudi Arabia had been playing a big role in the Afghan reconciliation efforts at the behest of the US government, suggesting that the deal between Kabul and Islamabad for the prisoners' release could be facilitated by Riyadh. Experts, however, say that Pakistan would not favor any government in Kabul which did not protect its interests. They say that, despite its willingness to set some Taliban leaders free, it will still bargain with the US and Afghanistan through leaders like Baradar. \"India is becoming a major player in Afghan politics,\" Ahmar said, referring to several economic and strategic pacts between Kabul and New Delhi during Afghan President Hamid Karzai's recent Indian visit. Experts say that the US and other NATO countries have to find a way in which Pakistan, particularly its powerful military generals, feels that its interests are not compromised. Ahmar concluded that the lasting solution of the Afghan conflict depended on how India and Pakistan came to an agreement about their respective roles in the post 2014 Afghanistan.",

"story": "Swiss politician threatens to expose German officials over tax-dodging A Swiss parliamentarian said he would aim to expose German public figures over alleged tax manipulations, if Berlin goes ahead with plans to buy stolen data on tax-evaders with Swiss bank accounts. Alfred Heer of the right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP) told the German daily Bild on Saturday that he and his party would aim to have the law changed so that names can be published. According to the Heer, financial sources in the Alpine republic have evidence that politicians and judges from Germany keep accounts in Switzerland and Liechtenstein for the purposes of evading tax. \"If Germany buys stolen bank data, we will work for a change in the law so that the complete Swiss accounts of German people holding public office have to be disclosed,\" he said. Heer is head of the right-wing SVP in the canton of Zurich and president of the Switzerland's taxpayers' federation. Thousands of names Switzerland is concerned about Germany's intent to buy a stolen disc containing names of 1,500 people with Swiss accounts who may have evaded German taxation. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said at the beginning of February that Germany was prepared to pay 2.5 million euros ($3.5 million) for the disc. The German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg has been offered a second disc containing 2,000 names, which according to German daily newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau includes information from bank groups UBS and Credit Suisse. Rising tension The tax data affair has soured relations between Germany and its Alpine neighbor, which sees the purchasing of the disc as another attack on its cherished banking secrecy. \"Here we have a new form of bank robbery,\" Swiss lawmaker Pirmin Bischof told Germany's Deutschlandfunk radio earlier this month. \"Before, you had to go to the bank and get hold of the money with a weapon. Today you can do it electronically by stealing data.\" But Schaeuble has said that the government would be legally justified in buying the stolen data. Chancellor Angela Merkel is also in favor of acquiring the CD. \"In principle, the decision was made two years ago,\" Schaeuble told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper, referring to a similar case in 2007, when the government handed over as much as five million euros for stolen tax data from Liechtenstein. rc/AFP/Reuters/dpa/AP Editor:Toma Tasovac",

"story": "German experts warn against fracking The country\u2019s Federal Environmental Agency says the risk associated with fracking is too big. Ministries involved are pushing for an initial ban on the practice until 2021. In their 600 page document, the agency warns of the dangers of obtaining gas from underground layers of rock. \u201cWe do not need fracking gas in Germany,\u201d says Federal Environment Agency (UBA) president Maria Krautzberger. Krautzberger believes that the environmental risks associated with fracking are too considerable and that the process shouldn\u2019t be banned, but instead made impossible by creating tougher stipulations. The only reason why a complete ban shouldn\u2019t be imposed, she adds, is because it would be difficult to legally enforce. Unique technique Hydraulic fracturing, commonly known as fracking, is a process whereby a mix of water and chemicals is pumped into the ground at high pressure. This technology fractures the rock, allowing the underground gas to be released. Recently, the US has seen a real fracking boom. This has allowed Americans to reduce their reliance on energy imports and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. After all, gas, when burned as fuel, produces less carbon dioxide than coal. But there are environmental concerns. Critics say that the chemicals used in the fracking process can enter the water table. New laws in the Fall The risk of water table pollution is one of the major reasons fracking is unpopular in Germany. German Economic Minister Sigmar Gabriel and Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks have presented a document which will be put forward in the fall. The proposed law aims to ban drilling below 3000 meters (1.9 miles) until 2021. Only in specific circumstances will it be allowed for research purposes. German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative CDU party does have a few fracking supporters in its ranks. But it\u2019s expected the economics and environment ministries will win over the government on the matter. The depth limits have been cleverly selected. All shale gas reserves that are worth any value in Germany are situated between 1000 and 2500 meters beneath the earth\u2019s surface. Thenew study from UBA supports the ministers\u2019 stance. \"Fracking is a risky technology, and for that reason it needs narrow restrictions to protect the environment and human health,\" says Maria Krautzberger. \"Not a climate solution\" The proposed restrictions should prevent companies from attempting to use fracking. According to the UBA, those companies using the technology in Germany have to undergo extensive environmental testing. Krautzberger believes the technique should be completely banned in water reserves, such as marshes or lakes, and protected areas. And even though it has helped the US reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, Krautzberger remains skeptical. \"Fracking is not a solution for protecting our climate, which will help us move across to renewable energy. It would be better if our country concentrated on proven, environmentally-friendly forms of energy.\" But she also points out another environmental problem. According to UBA experts, the liquid released in the process could transport other poisonous subterranean materials \"like heavy metals, aromatic hydrocarbons and, in some places, even radioactive substances.\" While Germany may be shifting towards a partial ban on fracking, other countries are opting in favor of the technique. Poland wants to reach its deep gas reserves as quickly as possible, so as to reduce its reliance on Russia\u2019s gas. The British government also wants to allow fracking in some national parks.",

"story": "Lewitscharoff: 'I am bound to make use of my own language' Sybille Lewitscharoff has been awarded the Georg B\u00fcchner Prize, Germany's most prestigious literary accolade. The author talks about her relationship to B\u00fcchner, the German language and her new plans. On Saturday (26.10.2013), Sybille Lewitscharoff will receive the most highly regarded honor in German literature: The Georg B\u00fcchner Prize. She has been popular since 1998, when she received the Ingeborg Bachmann Prize for her first work of prose, \"Pong\". Since then, the author has written numerous novels. DW reached Lewitscharoff in Rome, where she is staying at the Villa Massimo, and talked to her about books, new plans, the German language and the meaning of culture. DW: You once stressed that you can't really relate to the eponym of Germany's most important literature award, Georg B\u00fcchner. Sybille Lewitscharoff: I don't really feel a connection with him. There are other writers who have really grown on me and with whom I do feel a strong connection. Jean Paul for example. But the biggest contender for my great love is Franz Kafka. I need to slowly build a relationship with books. In the jury's decision, it says that \"Sybille Lewitscharoff expands the exact perception of the German present into areas of the satirical, the legendary and the fantastical.\" Do you agree with that? That's a nice description. Whether it's right on point, I don't really know. It's hard to say about yourself. You are currently in Rome. Has the stay inspired you to work on your newest project, a novel about Italian poet Dante? That idea was in my head before. It just so happened that I was invited to the Villa Massimo now, without anyone knowing about the project. Of course I can really delve into it now, even though I won't finish it here. But it's definitely a wonderful coincidence that I am allowed to be in Rome again and work on a novel that's based in Rome, too. What kind of novel project is this you're working on? I am planning to fully get my head into Dante. Now this is truly a great poet, a millennium poet. You don't just learn the Italian language from his work. It's the greatest work that Christianity has ever created. I wasn't primarily interested in getting into Dante's world, writing about Dante or about the century he lived in. I was fascinated by this idea: what happens when a Dante-convention today discusses Dante, and all of a sudden, a miracle occurs that has nothing to do with Dante? When a new Pentecostal miracle befalls the community? So it's about a Dante-convention that brings lots of different people with different languages together. What role does the language theme play? It's very important, because it's about breaking up the Babylonian confusion. People don't understand each other in all these different languages. That's a very great Biblical topic to revive. That's definitely an asset a writer can show off. That's our very own topic: what can we do with language? And what happens in different languages? That's very interesting! And language plays an important part in defining identity! Absolutely. That's why I'm opposing trying to produce an international novel. That's a very weak approach. You are bound to make use of your own language and society and your own experience. You can't just internationalize this from within. That has to happen through translations, by turning the text to make it work in the respective local language. Your book is about an understanding among people with different languages. How do you view German in light of the world language English? I'm only able to write a German novel. That means I have to overcome difficulties; have to come up with a smart solution that these people speak in different languages. But yet I have to write a German novel. I can't let too many people babble in different languages. That doesn't keep readers interested. It just doesn't work. But I need to reattach that to the German language, I need to transport the flickering of the other languages. That's quite difficult by the way. Today - at least in Europe - a great number of countries have come under economic discredit and can't provide jobs for the young people. Especially now, German language classes are in high demand in Goethe institutes in Greece, Spain, Portugal. They are packed, which they haven't been in decades. Can you also notice that in an increased cultural interest? Is culture also something that defines identities? I would definitely say Europe has cultural links. Of course also different traditions, the Roman Empire, the German empire, Habsburgs, that has very long historic ties. The Roman ancient world provided a strong unifying tradition over the course of many generations and centuries. Even though individuals might not be aware about it. One also talks about an extended cultural terminology. What does culture mean to you? I don't like to extend the cultural terminology, because it waters it down. To me, it's traditional areas such as literature, art, theater, music etc.",

"story": "Lake Chad: 'Countries need to recognize the gravity of the crisis' The Lake Chad Basin crisis is now at a turning point. Boko Haram\u2019s attacks and military counter-offensives have displaced at least 2.3 million people. The Lake Chad Basin is grappling with a humanitarian emergency affecting some 17 million people across north-eastern Nigeria, northern Cameroon, western Chad and Niger. Many of those affected have had to flee their homes. The majority of the displaced are sheltered by communities who are themselves among the world\u2019s most vulnerable. The Lake Chad Basin crisis was until recently one of the fastest growing refugee crises in Africa and it is becoming the most acute food and nutritional crisis in Africa. It is the fourth biggest humanitarian response for United Nations (UN) and non-governmental organisations in 2017. Toby Lanzer, the assistant Secretary-General to the UN, spoke to DW ahead of the Oslo Humanitarian Conference on Nigeria and the Lake Chad Region at the end of February. DW: How is the humanitarian situation in the Lake Chad region? Toby Lanzer: The situation continues to be very grave. I think over the past few months we have understood more fully what is happening thanks to an improved security situation which has enabled the United Nations and its partners to travel further afield from the main town, Maiduguri, and get a stronger appreciation from the people themselves who have been stuck in many villages and towns. But we know that there are millions of people in desperate need of humanitarian assistance and we are doing our utmost together with the international community to meet the needs. Has the response from foreign governments been adequate? Well, adequate is a difficult word to use. And I think there are so many crises in different parts of the world. I think that via DW and others we are hoping to get the word out. That there is a particularly grave crisis the numbers are huge 10 million in need, 7 million who are severely food insecure, and 515,000 children who are acutely malnourished. I don\u2019t think any single government on earth in the world could face that alone. International solidarity is required. And that is required at a time when pressures are high all over the globe and so, no, the response is inadequate at the moment but am hopeful that in coming weeks more countries will come on board and help the UN and NGOs to work with the communities and the authorities of Cameroon, Chad, Niger and of course of Nigeria, to meet the needs. What support do you want from the German government? I think Germany has really come on board as a very strong supporter in political terms and the chancellor herself has been to Niger one of the key countries in this region. I think that political support usually signals financial support which I understand will be on its way. And at the end of the day, that\u2019s actually what people need because the money will be translated into medicines, food, shelter, and all the other things that people who are in desperate need require on a day to day basis to weather this terrible storm that\u2019s afflicted them. What is your wish as far as the donor's conference is concerned? There will be a conference thanks to Germany, Nigeria and Norway, and with support of the UN, the international community will gather in Oslo Norway on the February 24. I think my wish there is really a stronger recognition by a broader range of countries including Canada, the Netherlands, and Korea. Let's say a broader range of countries who recognize the gravity of the situation and the scale of the need and that that they actually join the effort of countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Commission and the UN in meeting peoples various serious need to survive this violence perpetrated by Boko Haram, which comes on top of abject poverty, climate change and real challenges which have wrecked peoples lives and made it so very difficult for them. What could the governments of the countries located in the Lake Chad region do? We are hopeful that, whether it\u2019s Cameroon, Chad, Niger or Nigeria, they will continue to do what they have been which is to do that utmost to care for their own people. But there are limits to what poor countries can do. And you know on that note so many people look at me and say \" isn\u2019t Nigeria a rich country?\" Well it is and it is not. At the moment oil production has plummeted. Oil prices are low so it\u2019s a very trying moment for Nigeria to do everything that it would like to for its own people. But let's congratulate the government of Nigeria and others in the region for having facilitated the work of the aid agencies. For having made sure that we feel welcome, for making sure that we are safe. This is a difficult part oft the world to be operating in. Violent extremists are not particularly easy by any means when it comes to the populations of the region, but also aid agencies. So the governments really have been very forthcoming trying to do as much as they possibly can, but also welcoming the international communities support in this time of severe crisis. Toby Lanzer is the assistant-Secretary General to the United Nations and Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Sahel region. Interview: Daniel Pelz",

"story": "Tanzania to drop live TV coverage of parliament Tanzania plans to axe live parliamentary TV broadcasts, angering opposition legislators. Media practitioners and rights activists are still smarting over the closure by the government of a Swahili-language weekly. A move by the government of Tanzania to stop state-owned broadcaster Tanzania Broadcasting Corporation (TBC) from airing live streaming of parliamentary proceedings has triggered strong criticism. Human rights campaigners accuse the government of censorship. The decision to halt the broadcasts came a few days after members of the opposition faulted the government in parliament over its handling of the issue. \"We know the government wants to hide something, but if the problem is indeed the cost, we are willing to foot the bill because our aim is to ensure Tanzanians enjoy their right to see what is going on in the parliament\" said Salum Mwalimu, secretary general of the main Chadema opposition party. The right to information is guaranteed under the Tanzanian constitution, but there is no specific article enshrining freedom of the media. But analysts say media freedom is crucial to democracy, human rights and development since news media provide a basic information link between the government and the people. \"If you deny people the right to get direct information from a reliable source, you will force them to find it from unreliable sources likely to mislead them,\" said Simon Berege, president of the Media Institute of Southern Africa. Minister for Information Nape Nnauye said TBC was halting live streaming of parliament to minimise huge costs which it can no longer afford. \"TBC has been spending about 4.2 billion Tanzanian shillings ($ 2.1 million, 1.9 million euros) each year to foot costs associated with live coverage of the assembly. We have thus decided to stop the coverage,\" he said. Opposition legislators, lawyers and human rights activists expressed disgust at the move, accusing the government of curtailing press freedom and people's right to be informed. \"This is a serious violation of the people's rights to information,\" Zitto Kabwe an opposition legislator from ACT Wazalendo party said. Nnauye has repeatedly used his sweeping powers to warn, punish or completely shut down media organisations critical of the political establishment. Newspaper banned permanently In January 2016, the weekly Swahili-language Mawio newspaper was permanently banned for allegedly publishing 'inflammatory' news and feature articles about the ongoing political impasse in Zanzibar, where the results of a disputed election were annulled after claims of \"violation of electoral law\" by the Electoral Commission. The opposition has dismissed these claims. Western diplomats in Tanzania have expressed concern that the Commission had annulled the vote \"without having produced evidence to substantiate its claim that irregularities had taken place.\" The shutdown of Mawio applied to print and online editions. \"We had resorted all our efforts, time and professional capacities to bring you news and informative features that dared to call a spade a spade; we are shattered,\" Simon Mkina, one of Mawio's editors told DW. Tanzanian authorities have traditionally relied on a web of anti-press laws, including the Newspaper Act of 1976, under which the government can ban publications it considers seditious or keep the press in check. \"In fact this law retains most of the oppressive aspects of colonial laws which were meant to subjugate the colonized people,\u201d said Badala Balule, a media expert who has researched media legislation in Tanzania. \"The catch-all legislation enables officials to impose censorship almost at will upon relaying of information which the government deems secret. Prohibiting newspapers without registration is at the whim of a government-appointed official who may refuse registration if he is of the opinion that the publication may threaten national security\" Balule told DW. Balule also gives another example where the absence of a constitutional guarantee for media freedoms is a serious shortcoming. \"Classified information, [a category] which can be applied to any government document, also has its set of penalties, ranging from those imposed on civil servants for giving classified material to those imposed on the media for publishing it,\" he said. A study published in 2013 by the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said conditions for journalists in Tanzania were worsening, with reporters being harassed or attacked and censoring their own work out of fear of reprisals. Tanzania is a member of the international initiative Open Government Partnership, which according to its website \"aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance.\" Some Tanzanians view their country's participation in this scheme as a promising sign. \"I think that as a member of Open Government Partnership, Tanzania ought to conduct its business openly, there's no reason to hide anything,\" said Edith Nyallu, a resident of Dar es Salaam. However, Tanzania has recently passed harsher laws to censor electronic communications and the publication of unofficial statistics. The Statistics Law gives the National Bureau of Statistics sweeping powers to imprison or impose fines of 10 million Tanzanian shillings on journalists who publish data from unofficial sources.",

"story": "Curiosity lands on Mars to cheers on Earth NASA\u2019s Mars rover has landed successfully after surviving a complicated landing dubbed the seven minutes of terror. It will spend one Mars year searching for evidence of life. At 07:31 on August 6, Central European Time, after a journey of more than eight months and 500 million kilometers, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) - also known as Curiosity - landed successfully on the Red Planet. Shouts of delight erupted simultaneously from the NASA live feed and inside the European Space Agency, the ESA's operations center, where scientists and researchers had gathered to witness the event. At NASA's request, the Mars Express, which is controlled by ESA in Darmstadt, had been moved into position to observe the landing. The spacecraft has remained in orbit around Mars since December 2003, when ESA's Beagle 2 landing failed. The Curiosity landing was dubbed the \"seven minutes of terror\" because ground control had to endure an agonizing seven minutes of radio communication silence after the craft entered the planet's atmosphere before it knew whether it had landed successfully. Mark McCaughrean, ESA's Head of Research and Science Support, explains that touchdown is the moment when everything can go horribly wrong - and has done for other missions in the past. \"Lots of money and lots of time have gone into trying to do as much testing as possible, but in the end it came down to those seven minutes,\" says McCaughrean. There is also a 14-minute delay relaying images back to earth, which meant that Curiosity had already been on the surface of Mars for seven minutes when NASA received the information that the landing capsule had entered the planet's atmosphere. It wasn't long, though, before Curiosity relayed its first thumbnail photo via NASA's Odyssey satellite - the first of many. The high definition picture shows the back of Curiosity, wheels down, with the horizon of Mars in the background. A second image shows the view in opposite direction, with Curiosity's shadow against the surface. Curiosity is NASA's most challenging planetary science mission to date. Weighing one ton, Curiosity is the biggest and best-equipped rover ever to head to another planet. It's packed with laboratory equipment and will spend the next 686 days - that's one Mars year - searching for evidence that there was once life on the Red Planet. Of all the planets, Mars is the most similar to Earth. But it has gained a reputation as the Bermuda Triangle of the solar system. The first attempt to explore Mars was made by the Soviets in 1960, and since then the US, Europe, Russia and Japan have between them launched a total of 40 missions. But more than half have crashed, malfunctioned, or simply disappeared. As ESA's Mark McCaughrean points out, this was a very challenging mission. \"Mars has eaten up lots of spacecraft in the past with even lower technology systems,\" says McCaughrean. \"I think we should be really proud of what they've done at NASA to put that system together, and I'm excited about what comes next, which is doing the science.\" Over the next two Earth-years, Curiosity will explore Gale Crater, its landing site, to determine whether the atmosphere on Mars was ever capable of sustaining life - or perhaps still is, even if only at a microbial level. The crater is 155 kilometers (96 miles) wide. Data supplied by Mars orbiters has led scientists to believe that the surface of Mars was shaped by flowing water, a prerequisite for the existence of life forms. The geology of Gale Crater with its erosion patterns also suggests traces of water. Thomas Reiter, ESA's Director for Human Spaceflight and Operations, says he believes it's just a question of time before they find evidence of life on Mars. \"Hopefully [it'll be] now, with Curiosity,\" says Reiter. \"But we can't be sure. It might be the next mission. Maybe ExoMars [ESA's own Mars exploration program] will bring the final evidence for it.\" Mars has two polar ice caps composed of frozen CO2 and frozen water. There are also indications that liquid water may also be present, as images from NASA's Phoenix lander have shown what appear to be droplets. Mark McCaughrean of ESA's research division says Curiosity's work at Gale Crater will be different from that of other Mars rovers - Spirit and Opportunity - which have operated in different locations. \"They've gone into a very exciting place with a lot of different geology in a very small area,\" says McCaughrean. \"Gale [Crater] has this kind of treasure chest of minerals. In the past, Spirit and Opportunity have been to locations where there was more or less one thing going on. Gale has a lot going on in one location.\" The new rover will be looking for organic compounds, as well as nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur and phosphorus. The scientists want to analyze isotopes and minerals on Mars to learn how the planet's atmosphere has developed over the past four billion years. McCaughrean says ESA scientists will be on the edge of their seats as they wait for the data to come in from NASA. \"We've seen some of the other pictures come back already this morning,\" he says. \"But when the science starts and the big main camera deploys and the first panoramas [come in], I think this is going to be something quite special.\" The rover is not due to move for another week. But Manfred Warhaut, Head of ESA's Mission Operations Department, believes the information Curiosity will eventually provide will bring the international space community closer together. \"Today is a very big day for space,\" Warhaut said, adding that ESA feels emotionally involved in NASA's success. \"We have successfully landed, but the data that we have received so far indicates that also the forthcoming science mission for the next 26 months will be more rewarding for NASA.\" Warhaut hopes the successful landing will encourage NASA to revive its cooperation with ESA's ExoMars program from which it withdrew earlier this year because of budgetary cuts. But as Curiosity has already cost far more than envisaged - at $2.5 billion (2.1 billion euros) - and it's likely that NASA will want to get its money's worth from the project before it shares the spoils.",

"story": "Twitter's rainbow reaction to marriage equality vote in Germany Germany's historic same-sex marriage vote saw an outpouring of jubilation on social media. Hashtags like #MarriageEquality and #LoveWins were used to broadcast the news. \"Such a beautiful morning for Europe and the world,\" tweeted Dustin Lance Black, the American screenwriter and LGBTQ rights activist who won an Oscar for \"Milk\" (2008), the film tracing the life of the gay rights icon Harvey Milk. In the US, media outlets quickly took to Twitter to spread the news. Slate Magazine retweeted a picture of the German Green Party celebrating the yes vote by cutting a rainbow marriage cake crowned by two women. Meanwhile, the Stop Homophobia advocacy group urged its followers in Germany to \"Now go and get married!\" German author and journalist Carolin Emcke, winner of the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade in 2016, said that the \"feeling of happiness on this day cannot be damaged by all the slurs,\" referring to conservative politicians' statements against the vote. Feminist editor and author Teresa B\u00fccker, also from Germany, was brought to tears. \"Cry and I cry with you. Thanks to all who have fought so long for this day!\" she tweeted. Some were disappointed that Angela Merkel voted against the bill. Berlin-based gay travel writer, Adam Groffman, set off a flurry of debate when he pointed out Merkel's no vote. With the vote on same-sex marriage happening early morning Berlin-time, Australians were among the first to receive the news (Australia is eight hours ahead) and quickly took to social media to register their rainbow-colored support. They included the Australian Sex Party, which has been contesting elections since 2009. Popular singer and TV host David Campbell quickly noted that Australia, which has still to legalize same-sex marriage, has fallen behind Germany. Advocacy group Australian Marriage Equality was quick to note that Germany was the 23rd country to sanction same-sex marriage. Finally, Conchita Wurst, Austrian winner of Eurovision in 2015, sent out a live congratulations on Twitter, calling it a \"wonderful day\" for the LGBTQ community in Germany.",

"story": "Lukashenko protesters return to Belarusian streets Over 2,000 people staged a protest in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on Sunday, in the first opposition demonstration since Alexander Lukashenko banned such gatherings following his disputed election win in 2010. Participants waving the red-and-white flags of the historical republic as well as flags of the European Union gathered under the watchful eyes of a large contingent of riot police, singing songs and holding up signs with names of opposition figures who have been imprisoned. No arrests were reported in the protest that was unexpectedly allowed to take place by authorities. The march took place on Belarus's 'Day of Freedom,' an unofficial holiday that marks the day an independent state of Belarus was created in 1918. A number of prominent leaders from the opposition were on hand for the demonstration, including Vital Rymasheuski, who ran in the 2010 presidential election. \"The Lukaschenko regime has only one weapon: fear,\" he said at the rally, adding a call to boycott the next election. Relations between the EU and Belarus have reached a new low point because of continuing repression in the country, and the EU has been trying for years to step up pressure on the regime in Minsk through sanctions. On Friday, the EU agreed to expand these sanctions by freezing the assets of more companies and expanding a list of officials who are banned from entering the EU. Lukashenko has led the country since 1994, and has retained Soviet-style control, cracking down on opposition politicians and independent media. mz/tj (AFP, dpa)",

"story": "'Islamist' shot dead in Berlin after knife attack on policewoman A 41-year-old man of Iraqi origin has been shot dead in Berlin after he stabbed a policewoman. State prosecutors say the man was an \"Islamist.\" The attacker died in a police operation on Thursday, shortly after he stabbed a policewoman with a knife. Police said the man lived in Berlin and had been sentenced to prison by the regional court in Stuttgart in 2008. He was subsequently released on parole and also wore an electronic tag, which he removed on Thursday morning before the attack. Investigators first learned of the incident via a phone call from a passer-by on Heerstrasse in western Berlin's Spandau area, according to local public broadcaster RBB. The caller said a man with a knife was threatening people. Four police cars reached the area, a police spokesman told reporters. The man attacked one of the officers, who stepped out of her car. Several shots were fired after that, although it is not known how many police officers shot at the attacker. The man died of his wounds despite repeated attempts to resuscitate him, police said. The policewoman, who was brutally injured in the knife attack, was flown to a hospital in a rescue helicopter. Berlin's homicide squad is currently investigating the case. mg/msh (dpa)",

"story": "Nearly 60 hurt in New York City ferry accident Nearly 60 people have been injured in a New York City commuter ferry accident. The boat crashed into a pier during rush hour, leaving two people in critical condition. The Seastreak catamaran ferry, en route from New Jersey on the East River, hit Pier 11 in lower Manhattan Wednesday morning. \"The latest report we have is that 58 people were injured. Two of those were critical,\" coast guard spokesman Charles Rowe said, adding that an investigation would be launched. Both of the passengers in critical condition suffered head injuries, authorities said. Witnesses said the ferry was moving too quickly as it approached the pier, but Rowe said the cause of the accident was not yet known. Weather conditions were good at the time of the incident, with little wind and good visibility. \"Basically, it was a hard landing,\" city transportation comissioner Janette Sadik-Khan said at a news conference, adding that the ferry was traveling at a speed of 10-12 knots when it missed its docking target. Most of the injured were standing near the bow of the ship waiting to disembark and were thrown back into the ferry or below deck. Nobody fell into the water. There were 326 passengers and five crew on board the vessel at the time of the accident, said Rowe. Television images showed police and firefighters evacuating the injured on stretchers, and a large gash was visible on the ferry's hull. Dozens of ferries shuttle thousands of commuters from Brooklyn and New Jersey into Manhattan every day, but accidents are rare. In October 2003, 11 people were killed and 70 others injured when a Staten Island ferry hit a pier at full speed. dr/ipj (AFP, dpa, AP)",

"story": "Man found guilty of abusing Russian-German teenager who fabricated rape story A man found guilty of abusing a minor has been handed a 21-month suspended sentence. The case involved the same teenager caught up in last year's \"Lisa case,\" which caused a diplomatic row between Germany and Russia. Ismet S., aged 24, was found guilty of child abuse and producing child pornography after he admitted before a Berlin court to having consensual sex with a minor and filming it. The case garnered widespread attention as the minor in question was the same girl implicated in last year's \"Lisa case.\" That case, which received global media attention, involved a 13-year-old German girl of Russian origin saying that she had been kidnapped and raped, implying people of Middle Eastern origin were to blame. The girl, identified only as Lisa, told her parents that she was kidnapped on January 11 by three men, who looked \"southern\" and spoke broken German. Her lawyer then said that was taken to an apartment, where she was abused and raped. However, police said they had not found evidence to support the rape claim. Nevertheless, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Berlin authorities of trying to cover up the case, which in turn caused outrage in the Russian media The case strained diplomatic ties between Germany and Russia before \"Lisa\" admitted that she had lied. She had in fact run away from home and was staying with a 19-year-old male friend. As part of the investigation into the alleged rape, authorities also came across another older man Ismet S., who had had sex with Lisa a few months earlier, knowing that she was underage. Despite qualifying as abuse, consent proves crucial the ruling The court recognized that the defendant had cooperated during police questioning and hearing, sparing Lisa from going before the court. Nevertheless, she was present in the Tiergarten court when the judgment was read out. A speaker for the court also said they had taken into account that Ismet S. and Lisa had In Germany, the age of consent is 14. While non-consensual sex with a minor is considered statutory rape under German law, in cases where the act is considered consensual the crime is treated as child abuse. That worked in Ismet S's favor as he received 21-month suspended sentence. Any sentence longer than two years cannot be suspended and he would have faced prison. He was also ordered to pay a fine of 3,000 euros, which will go towards a victim compensation fund. dm/msh (AFP)",

"story": "Opinion: Juncker takes the bull by the horns EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker regrets Luxembourg's tax-saving tricks for big business and wants to put a stop to them. That won't do much for his credibility, says Christoph Hasselbach. Jean-Claude Juncker has gone on the offensive, but he left it very late. Juncker went into hiding for days, leaving his spokesperson to represent him, but he now admits it was a mistake not to comment on last week's accusations of tax evasion by multinational firms in his home country. He also regrets the tax advantages themselves. Now, suddenly, after the pressure continued to mount, the Commission is proposing an automatic exchange of information about these sorts of tax arrangements, and a uniform basis for assessment. In other words, the system Juncker spent more than twenty years building up in his homeland as prime minister and finance minister of Luxembourg is now to be combated at the European level. The initiative comes across as a clumsy attempt to draw a veil over Juncker's previous role. Entire country as a tax-saving scheme It clearly took the wily politician far too long to grasp the explosive potential of the affair, perhaps because it had become so normal. Using complicated financial constructs, Luxembourg has ensured that international firms have been able to save taxes that apparently amount to billions of euros. As Juncker was the country's finance minister for 20 years and prime minister of the Grand Duchy for almost as long - mostly simultaneously - he was intimately involved in the country's development into a financial center. The fact that the entire country functioned as a tax-saving scheme for rich foreigners and international companies contributed in large part to Luxembourg having by far the highest per capita income in the EU. But Luxembourg is not an isolated case. Ireland and the Netherlands have also made big tax concessions to big businesses. And all the governments knew it. Just a few days ago around 50 states, including Luxembourg, signed an agreement on the mutual exchange of information on bank customers. Such resolve is however still lacking where company taxation is concerned. Ordinary citizens make up the shortfall The Commission did initiate inspections of Ireland, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg in 2013; but these looked into questions of competition, not whether such tax deals were in themselves illegal. Yet this is precisely where the problem lies. Even Juncker now admits that just because something is legally permissible it doesn't follow that it is morally acceptable. If one EU country attracts business by offering incomparably low levels of taxation, it is living at the expense of others who can't afford to, or don't want to accept the loss of income. In the end, it is always ordinary citizens who have to make up the shortfall, with their taxes. This, and the fact that Europe has until now tolerated this ruinous competition, is the real scandal. It is grist to the mills of those who want to destroy the European idea. No wonder the French far-right leader Marine le Pen was the first to call for Juncker's resignation. She and all those of a similar political persuasion all over Europe are going to have a field day. Resignation unlikely Nonetheless, Juncker will almost certainly stay on as president of the Commission. The majority of his supporters in the Council of Europe and in the European Parliament will make sure of that. His election process was protracted and complicated; many other personnel decisions also depended on it, and party-political and geographical aspects had to be taken into account. Starting all over again now would open a huge can of worms. Besides, his resignation could well intensify the widespread public sense that the European elite are failing. In view of the current mood of rampant euroskepticism, Juncker spoke of \"Europe's last chance\" when he presented the new Commission. It must, then, have been clear to him what was at stake. What he clearly underestimated was the his personal role in whether the \"last chance\" will be seized or lost. One can only hope that this affair has shaken the EU awake, and that it really will put an end to minimal taxation for big businesses. It's a move that would be certain to win public approval.",

"story": "Turkish economy on shaky ground Turkey's tainted image in the wake of its crackdown on opponents after the failed putsch in the country has had a negative impact on the economy and development prospects. Daniel Heinrich reports from Istanbul. Hasan Selamat is perplexed. For 35 years, he's run a small jewelry shop in a backstreet near a bazaar in Istanbul. He's never experienced anything like the present situation some months after the failed coup in mid-July. \"In the first days after the putsch, it hadn't been so obvious at all,\" he said. \"But in the process, we witnessed more and more customers staying away. I can personally understand the tourists as many live in fear and do not want to travel to Istanbul because of the recent political events.\" Tourism accounts for roughly 13 percent of Turkey's gross domestic product (GDP). Since the beginning of 2016, revenues from the sector have shrunk by 40 percent, also hitting Hasan Selamat. \"My business is ruined,\" he said. \"In a cautious estimate, my revenues have declined by 80 percent, compared with last year's figures.\" The Turkish economy is hurting. GDP decreased by 1.8 percent in the third quarter, marking the first contraction since 2009. According to US ratings agency Moody's, the domestic economy will only grow by 2.7 percent in the next three years, way below the average 5.5 percent logged between 2010 and 2014. Red herring policy A half-hour ride from the bazaar, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek is welcoming reporters in one of Istanbul's poshest hotels. He wants to talk about the country's economic prospects. But he starts with a broadside against the EU. \"From a distance, our European friends are advising us to do this and do that,\" He said. \"But they never come here and listen to us to understand the traumatic events we've been going through; they just keep talking about raids and arrests. He said that was an outrageous behavior as the Europeans insinuated there were no legal controls in place in the country anymore. Omnipresent putsch attempt Even Istanbul's stock exchange has stopped being a place of sobriety where numbers rule. Two people lost their lives in the night of the failed coup, with a memorial stone commemorating the victims. In Turkey, you cannot simply separate economic and political events, said the stock exchange's chairman, Himmet Karadag. \"The Istanbul Stock Exchange had been infiltrated by the G\u00fclen movement long before the attempted coup.\" What about the lira's downward spiral? What about consumption shrinking by 3 percent? Karadag prefers to skirt all those issues and keeps lashing out at the G\u00fclen supporters. And he had this to add. \"Just look at the PKK terrorists and their Syrian sister organization YPG,\" he said. \"There's no justification whatsoever that the European Union keeps viewing a terror organization like the PKK as an alternative cooperation partner.\" Europe most important partner? Ege Yazga, an economics professor at Bilgi University in Istanbul, doesn't think much of such talk. He's more concerned about the halving of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Turkey in the first six months of the year. \"Europe is Turkey's most important export market and plays a huge role as a financial hub,\" he said. \"Turkey badly needs more foreign investment as we can't plug all the holes on our own.\" Carmaker not worried Despite all the problems at hand, carmaker Ford Otosan tries to look on the bright side of life. The company belongs in equal parts to the Koc holding firm and US automaker Ford. The G\u00f6lc\u00fck facility west of Istanbul is the biggest producer of the Ford Transit globally. Everything in here is export-oriented. Although overall Turkish exports dropped by 7 percent in the first half of the year, Deputy Managing Director Oguz Toprakoglu seems unfazed. \"We aren't worried at all about the political situation in the country,\" he said. \"Some 80 percent of our cars go to Europe. And we're the market leader when it comes to producing light and heavy duty vehicles; that's why we shouldn't be too concerned about the domestic market either.\" \"We had a bumper year in 2015 when we produced 1 million vehicles, and the odds are we'll be able to achieve the same again this year,\" he added. Presidential system a blessing? Such optimism is alien to Hasan Selamat near the bazaar in the old city center. Since the summer months, 600 of a total of 2,000 stores have had to close down. Selamet deplores that the West's media coverage of events in Turkey has been so negative. \"I'm not saying our government isn't making any mistakes; I'm a Social Democrat and have not voted for it,\" he said. \"But I expect Europe to treat us fairly; and as soon as our image improves, tourists are bound to come back in droves.\" Meanwhile in that posh hotel, Mehmet Simsek insists that political stability is what matters most. \"I think we'll win back stability with a presidential system.\" Simsek argued such a system would strengthen the executive powers as the president would be able to act independently of any parliamentary infighting. At the same time, he came out in favor of abolishing the 10-percent hurdle in parliament to ensure fair representation of all groups of the population. Analysts at Moody's have long made it abundantly clear what they make of the recent developments, sending Turkey's creditworthiness down to junk level, based on the political response to the failed coup.",

"story": "Sch\u00e4uble receives Charlemagne Prize German Finance Minister and veteran of several governments Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is seen as a man for tough jobs. On Thursday, he received the prestigious Charlemagne Prize in Aachen. Ever since the election in fall 2009, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has been the most important minister in Angela Merkel's government. He's the one with the most weight in political affairs, and, as the government's real number 2, is deeply involved in international politics - a constant presence at every important international gathering. On Thursday he received the Charlemagne Prize in Aachen for his service for European unification, an honor previously bestowed on the likes of Winston Churchill, Bill Clinton, Pope John Paul II, and indeed Merkel. The crowning of his political career Sch\u00e4uble, a lawyer who hails from the Baden region of south-western Germany, is one of the most important players in the current efforts to rescue the euro. He's seen as an eminence grise - both in Brussels and Berlin. Many of the measures that have so far been adopted carry his signature - for example, he played a central role in negotiations over the EFSF and ESM rescue funds and worked closely with the German chancellor on the European fiscal pact to impose budget discipline. Now he's being asked to take on a key formal position in solving the crisis by becoming head of the eurogroup - even though he's no longer young and anything but fit. He'll be 70 in the fall, but the new job would crown his long career in politics. The \"old fox,\" as he's sometimes known, has been in the business for over 40 years. As he says, \"Anyone who has dedicated his professional life to politics wants to determine the way things happen. And in a democracy, one calls that power.\" He obviously enjoys the challenges of the current crisis; as he told a German paper just last week: \"The chance of determining how things should be is still something that fires my imagination.\" A life like a political thriller Sch\u00e4uble's political biography is a bit like a thriller, with intrigue, hard knocks and scandals - there have even been suitcases stuffed with cash. Sch\u00e4uble graduated from high school just as the Berlin Wall was going up in 1961, and he decided to join the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). In 1972, under the chancellorship of Social Democrat Willy Brandt, Sch\u00e4uble made his first try at a seat in the German parliament. He won his constituency and has remained the member for Offenburg, on the border with France, until today. Ten years later, in 1981, he started his long intense relationship with Helmut Kohl. In 1984, Sch\u00e4uble became Kohl's chancellery minister. As the man who stood at the levers of power in the old Bonn republic, he was known throughout the country. Then when the Berlin Wall fell in November 1989, Sch\u00e4uble became West Germany's negotiator with the former communist East Germany over the Reunification Treaty. In less than twelve months, on October 3, 1990, unity had been achieved. Attack on home territory But only a few days later, Sch\u00e4uble was the victim of an assassination attempt. On October 12, in a public house in the town of Oppenau near his home in Baden, a psychopath shot him, injuring him severely. His life suffered a drastic change: from then on, he was confined to a wheelchair. Sch\u00e4uble is a public servant with a strong, almost Prussian sense of duty. What followed was the fight of his life. He refused to give in, and took up his duties as interior minister after just six weeks. Relationship with Helmut Kohl The following summer, on June 20, 1991, Sch\u00e4uble made one of his most important speeches in the German parliament, which helped to convince the members to vote in favor of moving the seat of government from Bonn to Berlin. But in 1998, he failed to convince Kohl not to stand again for chancellor. Kohl lost, dragging Sch\u00e4uble down with him. A CDU scandal and a career setback In January 2000 Sch\u00e4uble had to admit that he accepted a DM 100,000 donation for his party from an arms trade lobbyist. Sch\u00e4uble didn't tell the whole truth to parliament: it's an error for which he has never forgiven himself and for which he has publicly asked for forgiveness. As a consequence, in February 2000, he resigned as head of his party's parliamentary group. He and Kohl became bitter enemies; in a television interview in April, Sch\u00e4uble spoke of \"an intrigue with criminal elements,\" and \"a campaign to destroy me personally.\" The pupil broke with his mentor - for good. Checkered relations with Merkel At that time, Angela Merkel was CDU secretary general. In December 1999 she wrote her now famous article in which she advised her party to \"emancipate\" itself from Helmut Kohl. Kohl believed that Sch\u00e4uble was behind the move, but in fact he was as surprised as Kohl was. Nowadays he says he doesn't feel bad about it any more. Sch\u00e4uble and Merkel were never a team, though it was he who made her secretary general in 1998. In 2000, she overtook him to become party leader and in 2002 Sch\u00e4uble said he didn't think she'd make a good candidate for chancellor. Once she became strong enough, she called him back into government. In 2005, he became interior minister in the grand coalition with the Social Democrats, and in 2009 he was unexpectedly given the finance ministry. European from conviction Sch\u00e4uble is passionate about Europe, and is committed to greater integration. The Franco-German alliance is particularly important to him. Whether it was the European single market in 1986, the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, the Stability and Growth Pact in 1996 or the Lisbon Treaty in 2007 - Sch\u00e4uble was there. He is highly respected in the EU, and across party lines in Germany. He's flattered when people call him the last convinced European in Berlin, and he certainly doesn't look tired of his job. He continues to repeat that the euro \"is a stable currency, and, so long as we don't make any serious mistakes, it will continue to be so.\" He blames \"a lack of financial market regulation\" and \"an excess of state indebtedness\" for the currency's current problems. But, he adds, one can learn from a crisis. \"Europe has always emerged strengthened from every crisis. It'll be the same this time,\" he insists. \"In ten years we will have a structure that will be much closer to what one calls a political union.\" That's his aim. Sch\u00e4uble has had many jobs, and he's often aimed high: in 1998 he wanted to be chancellor, and in 2004, he would have liked to have been president. But as one commentator said, \"Whatever he does, he wants to do it better than anyone before him. That's the only vanity that he allows himself.\" Author: Iveta Ondruskova / mll Editor: Ben Knight",

"story": "German Social Democrats pledge more money for low-income earners Leaders of Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) have unanimously approved an election manifesto ahead of September's federal poll, hoping the promise of more cash will win over voters. Key points of the center-left SPD's platform are tax cuts and state handouts for low-income groups and families with children. These promises would be partly financed by a tax on the rich and a levy on stock transactions. \"We know that crisis management is necessary, and that is the core of this program,\" the Social Democrats' candidate for the chancellery, Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, told journalists on Saturday, April 18. The SPD is seeking to distance itself from Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) as Germany's two coalition partners gear up for a parliamentary election on Sept. 27. This year's election campaign is expected to be dominated by the fallout from the financial crisis, which has hit key sectors of German industry and put tens of thousands of workers on reduced hours with less pay. Other key issues for the SPD will be a move to ban the right-extremist National Democratic Party (NPD), as well as a complete phasing out of nuclear energy by 2021. The Social Democrats have also promised to prevent the privatization of Germany's national rail operator Deutsche Bahn until the next election. The much-disputed initial private offering planned for last year was put on hold due to the slide in global markets. Turn to the left? The party platform, which Steinmeier will officially unveil on Sunday, includes a 300-euro ($390) tax rebate for people on low wages, in return for not filing a tax return. The SPD says the plan will not just help low-income earners, but also help cut red tape. But the proposal has already generated ridicule from opposition parties on Thursday, when the German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung leaked the plans. Chairman for the Christian Social Union party's association of small and medium businesses, Hans Michelbach, said the bonus would hinder rather than help. He said it would only complicate people's taxes, and labeled it \"the worst form of rip-off.\" Secretary-general from the business-oriented Free Democratic Party, Dirk Niebel, described the scheme as typically socialist. His deputy, Carl-Ludwig Thiele, said the rebate would give tax authorities the added task of monitoring whether taxpayers applying for the bonus were earning a secondary income. The Social Democrats are also proposing to reduce the lowest-income tax bracket by four points to a rate of 10 percent. Families with children would also receive a 200-euro tax break. The measures would be financed by an increase in the top tax bracket - raising it to 47 percent for people with incomes of 125,000 euros and more, as well as a half-percent levy on stock exchange transactions. The party estimates their economic plans would generate 5 billion euros in extra revenue. The campaign trail begins The Social Democrats currently share power with their main political rival, Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), in a right-left \"grand-coalition.\" Both sides, however, seem ready to sever ties after September's election, although influential voices in both camps argue that, especially in difficult times, the grand coalition is the most prudent option. The conservative CDU opposes tax increases on the wealthy and wants to lower income taxes after the poll. \"Tax increases during a time of economic crisis is simply irresponsible,\" CDU campaign manager Ronald Pofalla said last week. \"Tax increases are poison for the economy and would endanger jobs.\" The SPD currently trails the CDU by about eight percentage points.",

"story": "Japan stocks surge as yen falls in G20 aftermath Japanese shares have jumped amid a further weakening national currency after top industrialized countries approved Tokyo's aggressive monetary policy. Japan aims to beat deflation by printing money. Japan's Nikkei stock market index surged more than 2 percent on Monday and the yen weakened further in Asian foreign exchange markets following tacit support from after the Group of Twenty (G20) nations for Tokyo's monetary policy at their weekend meeting. In a statement Sunday, the G20, which includes the world's top industrialized nations and emerging economies, pledged to refrain from competitive currency devaluation and said they wouldn't use exchange rates for gaining a competitive advantage. The G20 decided not to single out Japan for criticism although Japan's national currency has fallen 17 percent against the US dollar and 25 percent against the euro, leading to accusations that Tokyo had manipulated the yen to gain a trade advantage. Japan's newly-elected Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reiterated Monday that his policy was aimed at beating years of deflation, and not at manipulating foreign exchange markets. However, Abe also warned the country's central bank, the Bank of Japan (BoJ), that he would press for a revision of Japan's central bank law if the BoJ failed to commit to the aim of aggressive monetary easing to foster growth. Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa, who disagreed with Abe on this policy, is to resign from his post next month, several weeks ahead of the end of his term in office. uhe/kms (AFP, Reuters, dpa)",

"story": "Six volunteers begin 520-day isolation for Mars experiment In Moscow, six men have volunteered to live isolated in a special simulator for a year and a half as part of an experiment analysing the physical and psychological effects of a possible trip to Mars. On Thursday, the hatch closed behind six volunteers who entered a model space ship in Moscow, where they intend to stay until late 2011. As part of an experiment to study effects of long term isolation that would come with a manned mission to Mars, the men have begun a 520-day period of isolation in a special facility in Moscow. Three Russians, along with one man each from France, Italy and China, have entered the 550-cubic-meter facility where they will spend the next year and a half of their lives. The length of the trip is designed to simulate the amount of time it would take to travel to Mars and back. The Russian commander Aleksei Sitev said he was taking part because it was \"interesting\" and \"beneficial.\" \"I'm taking part in a unique experiment, and in an interesting adventure,\" Sitev said. Physical and psychological challenge Inside the facility, the men's time will be divided into three eight-hour blocks - one for sleeping, one for working, and one for leisure. One of the crew members, Frenchman Romain Charles told journalists what he was packing for the mission. \"Some pictures, books for my leisure time,\" Charles said. \"Trying to keep busy during those times, not to think too much about what is outside the module, trying to be focused on the trip.\" The men will only be able to communicate with the outside world via email, which would also be the case on a real trip to Mars. The model space ship The flight simulation takes part in the Institute for Biomedical Problems in Moscow, which has taken part in the preparation of most Russian space flights. A model space ship has been built, with limited living space for each crew member, equipment for numerous experiments to be carried out on board, as well as a greenhouse. The experiment is being jointly conducted by Russia, China and the European Space Agency and is designed to analyse the psychological and physical effects of such a long term trip into space. The volunteers will live exactly like real astronauts, except that they won't experience weightlessness and there is no cosmic radiation to deal with. All the food for the 520-day experiment had been given to the participants in advance, and it is up to them to ration it accordingly. Goodbye real world The hatch that closed behind the 'space explorers' will not be opened again until the experiment ends or one of the participants is forced to drop out. This is something that project director Boris Morukov hopes will not happen. \"Every crew member has the right to stop and quit the experiment... we have had such a negative experience in the past,\" Morukov said. \"I hope it won't happen again during this experiment.\" The crew members themselves are convinced that it will not be necessary. According to Russian team-member Sukrob Kalamov, there is at least one thing that unites them all: they have all been foolish enough to take part in this experiment.

"story": "Earthquake Rocks Indonesia A strong undersea earthquake of a magnitude of 6.7, at a depth of 45 kilometres, has rocked the eastern province of Maluku, scaring the residents. An initial tsunami warning was later lifted. Sulawesi Island in the east is being swamped by torrential rain and floods, with at least 60 dead so far. Tens of thousands of people have lost their homes in the central and southern parts of Sulawesi province, where many villages have been completely damaged. The authorities have deployed helicopters loaded with food and drinking water and have sent health teams with medicine to the affected areas, but they said continuous rain and floods had hindered their access. Aswi Nugroho from the Indonesian Red Cross said that:\"most of the relief agencies had been finding it difficult to transport deliveries because of blocked roads and bridges.\" Buried alive According to local officials, at least 40 people are believed to be buried alive in the central part of the province but the bad weather is hobbling efforts to rescue them. The situation is equally bad in the north-eastern part of the province, where days of heavy downpour have caused floods up to three metres high, submerging hundreds of homes and leaving thousands of people stranded. Deadly landslides occur frequently in Indonesia, where millions of people live in mountainous regions and near fertile flood plains close to rivers. Experts, however, blame illegal logging and deforestation for making the soil loose and causing landslides. Precaution measures \"How can we prepare ourselves for such a disaster?\" is the question on Aswi Nugroho's lips. \"How can we prepare ourselves so that the impact of such disasters is reduced?\" For many, the answer lies clearly in fighting global warming and climate change, which are held responsible for the changing weather conditions. Peter Rees, the Red Cross' Head of Disaster Response, told an Australian radio station, the number of natural disasters in the world has tripled in recent years as a result. No increase in geo-physical disasters \"Between 2004 and 2006, there was an increase of catastrophe cases from 278 to 481, including 137 floods. And this year there have already been 75 flood catastrophes. And it's clearly linked to the weather,\" said Rees. He explained that there had been no increase in geo-physical disasters such as earthquakes or volcano eruptions but a clear increase in weather-related catastrophes. Farmers in Central Sulawesi, which is one of Indonesia's key cocoa growing areas, are worried about their crop. Many fear that the heavy rains and floods will have an adverse effect on this year\u2019s production, leading to a potential fall of about 10 percent of the total cocoa output.",

"story": "EU urges speedy reforms in Ukraine In a flurry of diplomacy ahead of the Christmas holidays, Ukraine's leader visits Brussels while EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini heads to Kyiv. On the agenda: financial aid and reforms. The state's tax coffers were empty, which made it time to turn to a mighty neighbor to save the country from bankruptcy: That was the state of affairs in Ukraine a year ago, in mid-December 2013, when then-President Viktor Yanukovych traveled to Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin promised Ukraine $15 billion (12 billion euros) in loans. A year later, Ukraine again seeks help abroad - but this time in Europe. Additional funds are bound to be at the top of the agenda when Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk heads to Brussels on Monday (15.12.) for the first meeting of the EU-Ukraine Association Council, a body created to help implement the Association Agreement signed in June between the EU and Ukraine. The main thrust of the accord - freeing up trade between Ukraine and the 28-member bloc - has, however, been shelved until the end of 2015 due to massive Russian criticism. Sympathy, disappointment in Brussels Hard-hit by the war against the pro-Russian separatists, Ukraine's financial needs have almost doubled. Next year, Ukraine will need an extra $15 billion in addition to the loan granted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Yatsenyuk told parliament on Thursday, quoting an estimate by the \"Financial Times.\" The IMF has earmarked a total of $16.7 billion, a quarter of which has already been transferred. Ukraine is in no position to prevent national insolvency on its own, Yatsenyuk warned, adding, \"It's practically impossible without the help of our international partners.\" The Kyiv government hopes to collect the missing amount at an international donors' conference. No firm date has yet been set, and observers suspect the West wanted to wait for early elections and the formation of a government - a process concluded earlier this month. Officials in Brussels have said they understand the difficult situation in Ukraine, Daniel Gros told DW. \"Kyiv has the huge problem that it can't simultaneously build up a big army, reform the economy and keep the population happy,\" the director of the Center for European Policy Studies (CEPS) said. All the same, he added, Brussels is disappointed. \"No one has really seen reforms being implemented,\" Gros said. \"That's true for the economy, the police and the judicial system.\" The EU, the expert added, expects to see \"radical reforms in those sectors.\" Reform package in hand Ukraine's prime minister appears to be aware of the EU's wary stance, so he isn't going to Brussels with nothing but an outstretched hand. He'll also be bringing a list of reform plans: drastic state spending and subsidy cuts; tariffs for power, water, gas and heating for private households doubled or even tripled; the retirement age could rise from 60 to 63; and there are plans to replace free medical care with an insurance system. Subsidies for small wage earners will be reduced or even completely cut. In March, the EU promised Ukraine an aid package of about 11 billion euros. Only a small percentage has been disbursed - the rest depends on the reforms. The lion's share of the foreign aid for Ukraine is bound to go right back abroad. This year alone, Ukraine repaid \"debts and loans worth $14 billion,\" Yatsenyuk told parliament. That was a mistake, according to Gros. Ukraine, he said, should instead negotiate a deferral of debt payments. About 1 percent of the 10 billion euros from EU coffers is earmarked for humanitarian aid and economic restructuring, according to an analysis by Gros and his colleague Steven Blockmans. In the face of rampant corruption, they said, such aid programs are but a \"drop in a bucket.\" The expert suggested the EU should take unusual measures in Ukraine. Instead of transferring money to Kyiv as usual, the EU should open a host of small offices across the country and hand out cash directly to the needy, he said. Diplomatic offensive A new anti-corruption drive in the government may help sway European donors: three foreigners have joined the cabinet, including US-born Finance Minister Natalie Jaresko and Economics Minister Aivaras Abromavicius of Lithuania. Yatsenyuk's visit to Brussels on Monday is the start of a week of concerted EU-Ukrainian relations. European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini travels to Kiev on Tuesday. Ukrainian media report that the country's president, Petro Poroshenko, may travel to Brussels on Thursday and Friday to join an EU summit there. It's likely that, again, money will be on the agenda.",

"story": "Zimbabwe opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai dies Zimbabwe's longtime opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has died at the age of 65. The former trade unionist was one of Robert Mugabe's strongest critics.\u00a0 The vice president of the Zimbabwe Movement for Democratic Change party announced the death of Tsvangirai on Wednesday. The opposition leader passed away after a long battle with cancer. \"I can confirm that he died this evening. The family communicated this to me,\" Elias Mudzuri said. \"It is sad for me to announce that we have lost our icon and fighter for democracy,\" An opponent for the president It's not easy to beat somebody like Robert Mugabe at his own game. And winning over the hearts and minds of Zimbabweans was definitely a game that Mugabe had played for many years. But Tsvangirai did manage to beat him a number of times. There were the 2008 elections which Tsvangirai won, albeit with a margin too small to win a majority. Then there were reforms which would have given Mugabe more power and which Tsvangirai and other opposition leaders managed to stop. Tsvangirai was a man who didn't take part in the liberation and was 30 years younger than Mugabe, but who still managed to become the figurehead of Zimbabwe's opposition and Mugabe's biggest challenger. Read more: Zimbabwe opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai hints he will step down \"Without Morgan we could not have been talking about democracy,\" says Ostalos Gift Siziba, leader of the Zimbabwe National Students' Union. \"He was fighting the authoritarian regime as far back as the 1990s when Robert Mugabe was still organized with a ruthless, violent machinery.\" A die-hard trade unionist Born in 1952 as a son of a farmer and mineworker, Tsvangirai left school early and worked for almost ten years in a nickel mine, finding his calling in the mine workers' union. As a unionist, he joined the new ruling ZANU-PF party at in 1980 at the dawn of independence. Like many at the time, he admired Mugabe and was later criticized for failing to condemn the crackdown on the opposition in Zimbabwe's Matabeleland in the late 1980s. Read more: Zimbabwe's new cabinet: Little sign of change It was only in the mid-1990s that Tsvangirai became openly critical of Mugabe's regime. \"The first thing that I knew about Morgan Tsvangirai was the campaign that he did from Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions. I saw planes dropping papers with a warning about the price of bread going up to 50 Zimbabwean dollars. At the time bread was below 5 dollars,\" remembers Farai Gwenhure from the Tajamuka/Sesjikile campaign, a youth movement that deals with the problems facing Zimbabwean young people. A short time later, the prices skyrocketed even higher. Food queues were a daily sight and bundles of Zimbabwean dollars soon became worthless. In the 2000s, the US dollar and South African rand replaced Zimbabwe's currency. Read more: Morgan Tsvangirai, Zimbabwe opposition leader, airlifted to South African hospital A voice of opposition \"Tsvangirai led mass demonstrations and worker boycott demonstrations. He negotiated for workers' rights in Zimbabwe,\" recalls Morgan Komichi, deputy chair of Tsvangirai's MDC-T party. At the time, Tsvangirai, still a member of ZANU-PF, was the Secretary General of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions. Together with civil society actors, student unions and church groups, he became a leader of the National Constitutional Assembly, a non-governmental organization which organized protests and became highly critical of the ZANU-PF government. In 1999 Tsvangirai formed the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) which became Zimbabwe's largest opposition party. \"Robert Mugabe wanted to build a one party state in this country \u2014 an idea which was bought by Zimbabweans,\" explains Siziba from the Zimbabwe National Students Union. \"For Morgan Tsvangirai to introduce a new song of social democracy was not an easy struggle.\" In 2002, Tsvangirai made his first attempt as the MDC's presidential candidate. The 2000s saw him in and out of jail for charges or treason and an allegedly planning to kill President Mugabe. He was severely tortured in police custody, which left him hospitalized with a cracked skull. In 2008, when much of the world had turned its back on Zimbabwe, Tsvangirai was seen as the best person to deal with the political and economic crisis. At his second attempt at the presidency, he actually won the election, but lacked an outright majority to form a government. President Mugabe then won the re-run of the election, which Tsvangirai and the opposition boycotted on the grounds that they believed it would not be fair. What followed were months of negotiations and a power-sharing deal that was brokered by South Africa. Tsvangirai had not managed to defeat Mugabe outright, but he had managed to get foot into government as Prime Minister, with a shared ZANU-PF and opposition cabinet. \"The DNA of politics in Zimbabwe has always been aligned to ZANU-PF,\" explains Gwenhure. \"Everybody thought government means ZANU-PF. But when the [power-sharing deal] was signed under the leadership of Tsvangirai, everyone knew that there are some other Zimbabweans who can do it differently, stabilize the economy and so on.\" The unity government The unity government lasted one political term, but Tsvangirai felt that Mugabe and ZANU-PF were still calling the shots. He spent time touring the world in an attempt to repair relations with foreign governments and international institutions, but many Zimbabweans saw little change in their lives. In an interview with DW, Tsvangirai admitted that opposition support suffered as a result. \"It was not a perfect agreement but I think we managed to save the country. There may have been some damage because of the demobilization that would have taken place in the opposition forces.\" In spite of personal tragedies, such as the death of his wife in a car crash which he survived, and the death of his grandson in a swimming pool a short while afterwards, Tsvangirai remained a career politician until the end. He lived to see the downfall of his rival Robert Mugabe, albeit not through a victory for the opposition but through a coup in Mugabe's own ranks. For the Zimbabwean opposition movement, as well as his own party which saw several splits over the years, he remains a respected icon. \"Problems that happened in the party could be here and there but he has managed to hold on to the movement,\" says Komichi. \"Whenever there were challenges or splits, people would remain inclined to him and up to now the movement is going on. He's the torch bearer, he's the visionary.\" In late 2017, Tsvangirai spoke of a new generation taking over the reins in Zimbabwe. \"I am looking at the imminent prospect of us as the older generation leaving the levers of leadership to allow the younger generation to take forward this huge task that we started together,\" he said. Both the generation of Mugabe, who was 93 when he was forced to step down, and himself at 65, belong to the old guard. The question now is how the next generation will go forward.

"story": "EU Signs Pirate Deal With Kenya The EU has signed an agreement with Kenya that provides for the handover of pirates seized by the German Navy off the coast of Somalia -- but no decision has been made whether the pirates would be transferred to Kenya. The agreement was signed in Nairobi on Friday, March 6, by Kenyan Foreign Minister Moses Wetang'ula and the Czech ambassador to Kenya, said a Foreign Office spokesman. The Czech Republic holds the rotating presidency of the EU. The pirates are on board the German frigate Rheinland Pfalz, which apprehended them on Tuesday when they attacked a German merchant vessel off Somalia with anti-tank missiles and firearms. The frigate is part of the EU's anti-piracy mission Atalanta in the Gulf of Aden, which Germany joined in December. The foreign office spokesman said no decision had been made whether the nine pirates captured by the German Navy would be transferred to Kenya. Exploring unchartered territory First, independent prosecutors in Hamburg need to decide whether the men should face trial in Germany. The German navy has given them all its evidence, and it is now up to them to say whether German interests were at stake during the attack. A specially convened commission, representing Germany's Interior, Foreign, Defence and Justice ministries, met this week to discuss the legal status of the pirates -- hitherto unchartered legal territory. The Hamburg court, which is responsible for maritime legal issues, will provide Berlin with more time to decide on what to do with the alleged pirates. A spokesperson for the court has already said that the decision to open the probe meant in no way that the nine men would be brought to Germany for processing. \"The government is studying in-depth whether the suspected pirates could, if necessary, be handed over to a third country for prosecution,\" the government said Thursday in a statement. This is the first time in Germany's modern history that its navy has made any apprehensions at sea. One possible destination for the nine men could be Kenya, which on Thursday received seven suspected Somali pirates captured Feb. 11 by the US guided-missile cruiser Vella Gul. The seven men will face prosecution under a bilateral pact between the US and Kenya. Prosecution uncertain The German Navy frigate Rheinland-Pfalz took part Tuesday in a dramatic rescue after the nine Somalis, allegedly armed with anti-tank rocket launchers and firearms, were said to have attacked a German merchant vessel off the Somali coast. The MV Courier, owned by a Bremen-based shipping company, had been sailing under an Antigua and Barbuda flag. No German nationals were on board. The Interior Ministry said Wednesday that there were no grounds for a German prosecution of the captured men, because no German interests were judged to have been endangered in the attack. Germany currently has no agreement with third-party countries under which captured pirates could be prosecuted. Under European law, which applies to the German naval mission, pirates can be held for up to 12 days. The men are to stay on board the Rheinland-Pfalz until a decision is reached. In 2008, pirates seized more than 200 ships off the Somali coast, demanding millions of dollars in ransom.",

"story": "Amazon close to launching new streaming service Amazon is reportedly a month away from launching a new subscription-based music streaming service. Once licensing agreements are signed, Amazon will enter a crowded market dominated by Spotify and Apple Music. The online retail giant Amazon is close to signing licensing deals with some of the world's preeminent record labels, a final step in its bid to claim a chunk of the digital music market, according to a report in the Financial Times. The newspaper cited two people familiar with the matter, who said Amazon could launch its streaming service as soon as September, though the company has yet to officially confirm a launch date. Another player looking to enter the music streaming fray was Pandora, until now a provider of internet radio. That company was similarly close to inking agreements with the holders of music rights and could introduce its service by the end of the year, Financial Times noted. A subscription to both companies' new streaming platforms would cost $9.99 a month, according to the Financial Times. Other industry players, including Spotify, Apple, SoundCloud, Deezer, Tidal and Google Play, all offer similar services for that price. According to the report, Amazon would pay the same level of royalty fees as Apple, which pays a bit more than Spotify. Spotify, which counts more monthly subscribers than any other music streaming service, diverts about 70 percent of its revenue to copyright owners. cjc/uhe (Financial Times, dpa)",

"story": "Sieren's China: Economic growth better than expected Despite the threat of a trade war with the US, China's economic growth has exceeded expectations, allowing an opportunity to address certain problems, says DW's Frank Sieren.  US President Donald Trump was surely not pleased about the news, perhaps he even foamed at the mouth. According to the latest figures from Beijing, China's GDP between January and March this year grew by 6.8 percent more than during the same period in 2017. This is even more than the 6.7 percent that certain experts had predicted. It is also more than the government's original goal of 6.5 percent. The result comes after the closure of several factories that were harmful to the environment. The government also put a brake on loans and clamped down on shadow banking, stopped insurance speculation and slowed down the real estate boom. The message is that China can maintain robust growth even if it puts limits on itself. Of course, as always, one can question whether the figures from China are correct. The president probably does not even know whether the real figure is 6.6 or 6.7 percent. However, it is clear that the general trend of recent decades seems reliable. What is also clear is that in future, exports will play a smaller role for China's economy. Ten years ago, they made up 35 percent of China's GDP. Now, they comprise 18 percent. Growth in urban centers Consumption in China now makes up 77.8 percent of the economic growth, having increased by 20 percent since last year. Compared to the US, where it makes up 70 percent of the economy, there is still potential in China, which has at least four times as many inhabitants as the US and yet only now has attained the per capita income of Macedonia (GDP per capita: $15,200 in 2017). It is not totally off the wall to conceive that China could one day tell the US that it can no longer supply its market because it needs to meet its own domestic demand. Read more: Sieren's China: Stronger than presumed China is already producing more and more for its own market. Chinese consumers are buying more than ever, from make up to clothes to technical devices, after long having been considered people who preferred to save. In urban centers in particular the market for services and domestic consumption are driving the economy. Chinese people are buying more and more Chinese products. Ten years ago, there may have been no alternative to the iPhone, which is number four in China, but now there are many. Last year, the three top phones in China were made by Chinese companies. Innovation-driven boom The fact that Beijing invested in key industries of the future such as IT and artificial intelligence is already paying off. Online traders always know better what customers want. Apps made by Alibaba and WeChat are making it extremely easy to consume. Smartphone users can order vegetables, cinema tickets and train tickets by app; they can pay the rent, hire out bikes and much more. China at the same time has learned to produce in a more efficient way. In the first quarter of 2018, it produced 30 percent more industrial robots than in the year before and 139 percent more electric cars. Stricter rules for buying real estate apparently did not frighten away investors but simply increased trust in the market's stability. The real estate sector grew by 10.4 percent \u2014 more than in the past three years. Demand is high because people continue to migrate from rural areas to urban centers; and not only migrant workers but people who have already been successful in rural areas and want to do the same in the big cities. Consumer trust is higher than in the past three years this does not look set to change. Chinese families are generally not in debt \u2014 instead they are sitting on reserves. Domestic debt as a whole might be high but this is not an issue as long as China doesn't have any debts abroad and has access to huge currency reserves. Bad news for Donald Trump! US only plays a marginal role Even if trade were to completely stop between the US and China, it would only affect China's growth by between 0.3 and 0.6 percent according to the Beijing-based economy professor, Hu Xingdou. This is not likely to happen anyway. Thanks to its \"New Silk Road\" project, China is already creating new markets to sell its exports, in South Asia, Latin America and Africa for example. Therefore, the current dispute with the EU about transparent investment conditions will also only have a marginal impact. China's exchange of goods with ASEAN states alone has grown by 9 percent to $279 billion (\u20ac227 billion). When the Silk Road is finished, it will link 65 countries and unite some 40 percent of the global economy. Of course, the project is skewed in China's favor and it will get the biggest slice of the cake. It is also intentional that the US be marginalized. Of course, China has its weak points too. The gap between the rural and urban parts of the country remains a challenge for Beijing. This is reflected in the quarterly figures by slow retail figures in rural areas. The debts of state businesses and official budgets are also growing. Inefficient state companies that have high debts have to be reformed or closed and the overcapacity in state, cement and aluminum production has to be balanced. But with this good news for the economy, Beijing has a good base for solving such problems step by step. Frank Sieren has lived in Beijing for over 20 years.",

"story": "South Sudan expels UN aid coordinator The United Nations has announced the expulsion of one of its deputies from South Sudan. Authorities have offered no official explanation, but the UN has pointed to the aid coordinator's critique of the government. The South Sudanese government has decided to expel Toby Lanzer, the outspoken deputy chief of the United Nations mission to the country, UN officials said Monday. The announcement came after Lanzer was refused entry into South Sudan as he tried to return to wrap up official business ahead of the end of his assignment there later this month. Authorities in Juba have not offered an official explanation for the decision, but the UN has suggested that it stems from Lanzer's critique of the government and the rebels over the recent increase in sectarian fighting. \"Mr. Lanzer has been instrumental in addressing the increasing humanitarian needs of conflict-affected communities in the country and ensuring that life-saving humanitarian assistance reaches the most vulnerable,\" said a UN statement. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called on Juba to immediately rectify the situation by allowing Lanzer to finish his work in the country before he is replaced by Eugene Owusu of Ghana at the end of the month. Humanitarian crisis rapidly escalating In May, Lanzer released a statement noting his dismay after fighting in the Unity and Upper Nile states forced 100,000 people to flee their homes in the course of a single week. Following the advance of the South Sudanese army on the rebel-held town of Leer, Lanzer argued that the military operations had \"devastated countless lives\" after witnesses told him tales of rape and civilian murders. On social media last week, Lanzer tweeted: \"4.6 million people in South Sudan will be severely, yes severely, food insecure by July. That is 800,000 more than in July of last year.\" Lanzer is due to take up his new post as UN regional humanitarian coordinator for the Sahel in a matter of weeks. es/cmk (AFP, dpa)",

"story": "German football president Niersbach wants FIFA spot Germany's most powerful football chief wants to become a key decision-maker at FIFA. The world's governing body continues to go under serious scrutiny around ongoing corruption allegations. It's official: Wolfgang Niersbach, the president of the German Football Association (DFB), wants to be Europe's next representative on FIFA's executive committee when current board member Theo Zwanziger steps down next year. Zwanziger, Niersbach's predecessor at the DFB, will step down on May 24, 2015 at the FIFA Congress in Zurich. Niersbach will need to gain the support of UEFA's member countries in March to be then put forward as Europe's voice on the Executive Committee. \"I'm standing for this election because I want to defend the European position (in FIFA) and I'm convinced that German football should not lose its voice on the most important decisions,\" the 63-year-old said in a statement on Friday. Niersbach, though, will not challenge Sepp Blatter for the main post at FIFA and Michel Platini, the president of Europe's governing association UEFA, has declined to stand against Blatter too. Loud German voice Several German football officials have been criticial of the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup, which has come under scrutiny over allegations of potential corruption and the handling of Michael Garcia's report. Niersbach has previously spoken in favor of a public release of the report, while Reinhard Rauball, president of the organization responsible for running Germany's top two divisions, the DFL, has suggested World Cup boycotts and even a potential split between UEFA and FIFA. \"He (Niersbach) can be the one to fight here for transparency and clearing everything up,\" Rauball said. \"He has outstanding international contacts and enjoys the full backing of German football.\" Delay the maiden Arab Cup On Friday, Zwanziger told German newspaper \"Rheinische Post\" that the 2022 tournament should be cancelled and spread around various Arab nations four years later in the winter. \"The United Arab Emirates, Oman and Qatar: it's a larger area and it could be held in winter from the start,\" he told the paper. \"That is what I would consider to be an acceptable solution, as it allows for society in the Gulf region to undergo a change.\" Zwanziger believes \"world football will not come to peace\" unless the small, oil-rich country Qatar is stripped of its right to host the tournament in 2022. rd/al (AP, dpa, Reuters)",

"story": "Deutsche Bank reflects on values as profits drop Deutsche Bank halved its earnings in the second quarter of 2013. While Germany's biggest bank is still struggling with the financial crisis and legal problems, a corporate culture change is supposed to help. \"In the second quarter our core businesses performed well, our franchise remained strong,\" a Deutsche Bank press release claimed. But the bare figures tell a different story: halved earnings from the first to the second quarter, to net earnings of 335 million euros ($444 million) for March through June of this year. Pre-tax income shrunk 18 percent, to 792 million euros ($1 billion). As Europe's largest investment bank continues to struggle with the shadows of the past, Deutsche Bank heads J\u00fcrgen Fitschen und Anshu Jain are promoting a strategy to transform the institution's culture from within. Meanwhile, the bank is also working to adjust to new European regulations. Lost values Expensive legal problems continue to be the bank's greatest plague. The bankruptcy court case for media house Kirch has been drawn out for 10 years. Then there's the Libor probe, over allegations that the bank manipulated inter-bank lending rates. Not to mention ongoing litigation over subprime mortgage lending in the United States. In the second quarter, the bank set an additional 630 million euros ($836 million) aside for dealing with legal issues, bringing its total litigation reserve to 3 billion euros ($4 billion). Co-CEO J\u00fcrgen Fitschen responded to the accusation that banks have been looking after their interests rather than those of their customers by admitting that principles and values were simply nixed on many occasions. \"This should be taken very seriously,\" Fitschen said. Corporate culture shift Last fall, a survey found that only 40 percent of Deutsche Bank customers were satisfied - apparently one of the main motivations for the company's heads to seize the rudder and change course. \"The customer should have the feeling that he's at the center,\" Fitschen said. Last week, the bank issued a new canon of values listing six guidelines for its 100,000 workers (about half of whom work in Germany). Keywords include integrity, sustainability, customer orientation, innovation, discipline, and partnership. Emphasis was placed on ethical responsibility and long-term over short-term success. Fitschen said everyone is \"very passionately\" working to reach the point where \"if we are not loved, then at least we are respected for the things we do.\" He said that not only does he believe in the possibility of change, but \"we do ourselves a great favor with it.\" The head of Deutsche Bank's employee council Alfred Herling isn't completely convinced. He's concerned there will be consequences for workers, and that there's still a need for clarity on how violations will be punished. Reconciling values and numbers With this new canon, Deutsche Bank is ultimately seeking to increase its bottom line. In the future, average savings account holders are supposed to be treated the same as wealthy private customers and professional investors like insurers and retirement funds. With this in mind, the company has set the goal of pre-tax profits from portfolio management at 1.7 million euros by 2015. This seems particularly ambitious when compared to the only 82 million euros gained from this sector for the second quarter of this year. Fitschen emphasized trustworthiness as the link between changing corporate culture and increasing profits. \"What's decisive is the experience every businessman, every investor, every depositor has with his bank, which has to completely and fully convince him that he has a reliable partner sitting across from him,\" Fitschen said. Debt ratio complications Deutsche Bank is also continuing its work on compliance with stricter regulations for European banks, including increased equity ratios issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Based on Deutsche Bank figures from the most recent quarter, its rate is about 10 percent - that means it's well ahead of schedule, since that was a 2015 goal. But that hasn't resolved everything. Starting in 2018, the supervisory committee wants to introduce a leverage ratio of 3 percent, in order to prevent banks from working with an inflated proportion of lent money - which can be a problem in times of financial difficulty. Although it sounds like a paradox, the bank's revenues will have to shrink. Currently, Deutsche Bank's balance sheet total is around 1.9 billion euros. To stay within proper debt ratio bounds, the bank would have to reduce its revenues by about 250 million euros (although some analysts say this should be closer to 500 million euros). In any case, overflowing profits are not to be expected from Deutsche Bank in the foreseeable future.",

"story": "Proposed Nabucco Gas Pipeline Gets European Bank Backing The heads of the EU's European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) said Tuesday, Jan. 27, that they are prepared to provide financial backing for the Nabucco gas pipeline. Spurred on by Europe's worst-ever gas crisis earlier this month, which left millions of homes across the continent without heat in the depths of winter, Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany invited top-ranking officials from both the EU and the countries involved in Nabucco to inject fresh momentum into the slow-moving project. Nabucco, an ambitious but still-unbuilt gas pipeline aimed at reducing Europe's energy reliance on Russia, is a 3,300-kilometer (2,050-mile) pipeline between Turkey and Austria. Costing an estimated 7.9 billion euros, the aim is to transport up to 31 billion cubic meters of gas each year from the Caspian Sea to Western Europe, bypassing Russia and Ukraine. Nabucco currently has six shareholders -- OMV of Austria, MOL of Hungary, Transgaz of Romania, Bulgargaz of Bulgaria, Botas of Turkey and RWE of Germany. But for the pipeline to get moving, Nabucco would need an initial cash injection of an estimated 300 million euros. Both the EIB and EBRD said they were willing to invest in the early stages of the project through a series of loans, providing certain conditions are met. \"The EIB is ready to finance projects that further EU objectives of increased sustainability and energy security,\" said Philippe Maystadt, president of the European Investment Bank, during the opening addresses by participants at the \"Nabucco summit\" in Hungary. The EIB is prepared to finance \"up to 25 percent of project cost,\" provided a secure intergovernmental agreement on the Nabucco pipeline is reached, he said. Maystadt noted that of 48 billion euros of financing it provided last year, a quarter was for energy projects. EBRD President Thomas Mirow also offered financial backing to the Nabucco pipeline, on the condition that it \"meets the requirements of solid project financing.\" The bank would need to see concrete plans and completion guarantees, besides a stable political agreement, said Mirow. EU wary of future gas crises Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek, whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU, spoke about the recent gas crisis caused by a pricing dispute between Russia and Ukraine that affected supplies to Europe. \"A new crisis could emerge at any time, and next time it could be even worse,\" Topolanek said. He added that reaching an agreement on Nabucco is a \"test of European solidarity.\" The latest gas row between Russia and Ukraine has highlighted Europe's need to diversify its energy sources and thrown the spotlight on Nabucco. But critics insist that the vast project will remain nothing but a pipe dream because its backers cannot guarantee that they will ever have sufficient gas supplies to make it profitable. EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs urged political leaders to commit firmly to Nabucco by the end of March, or risk jeopardizing the project. In his opening address as host, Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany called on the EU to provide 200 to 300 million euros within the next few weeks to get the construction of the pipeline off the ground. Gyurcsany stressed that he was not hoping for a loan, but rather for starting capital from the EU. US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Bryza noted that the Tuesday summit had made it clear that Gyurcsany, who dismissed Nabucco as \"a dream\" in 2007, was now fully committed to the energy supply diversification project. On the supply side, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan both indicated they would be willing to supply some of the gas. \"Azerbaijan, which is according to current plans is a transit country, could eventually serve as a supplier as well,\" Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said. Azerbaijan's gas reserves of some two or three trillion cubic meters would be sufficient to last \"several decades,\" he said. Austrian Economy Minister Reinhold Mitterlehner suggested that Egypt and Iran could also be brought in as suppliers in the long term. But a deal currently seems unlikely with Iran given the long-running international standoff over its disputed nuclear program. Russia, Ukraine still wrangling Meanwhile, Russia and Ukraine were still wrangling over the details of the deal which ended their gas quarrel earlier this month. Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko said on Tuesday he would stand by the terms of the agreement with Russia, even though not all the details are to his liking. But Russian officials questioned his reliability, saying that the political rivalry between Yushchenko and Prime Minister Yulia Timoshenko could still lead Kiev to cancel the contract. \"The agreements signed are not easy ones, but Ukraine fully takes up the performance (of its commitments) and guarantees full-fledged transit to European consumers,\" Yushchenko told journalists in Brussels after a meeting with the head of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso. The assurance that Yushchenko would abide by the terms of the agreement finalized by Timoshenko was \"an important step forward in allowing us to focus on our broader relationship,\" Barroso said. But the spokesman for Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said that Moscow still feared that the growing rivalry between Yushchenko and Timoshenko, who are set to face off in next year's presidential election, could torpedo the deal. EU in talks to upgrade Ukraine's transit system Yushchenko's working breakfast with Barroso was dominated by the energy question, with both men highlighting the need to upgrade Ukraine's gas-transit system and build more links between Ukrainian and European energy markets. The commission is set to host an international conference aimed at gathering donations to upgrade Ukraine's gas-transit system on March 23 in Brussels. The EU and Ukraine have agreed to form a joint expert group to plan the meeting, the leaders said Tuesday. During the conflict, Barroso had warned that both Russia and Ukraine were damaging their credibility as reliable partners. But on Monday he said that \"in bilateral relations, we are not taking any negative consequences from (the gas row) because we believe Ukraine wants to deepen the relationship with the EU, and we also want to deepen the relationship with Ukraine.\" He also said that \"we have to state very clearly that we were disappointed by the problems between Ukraine and Russia,\" and called for political stability and reform in Ukraine. His diplomatic balancing act is likely to have a frosty reception in Moscow, where Peskov said that Russia \"would prefer to hear from the European states a very serious and severe evaluation of who is guilty for interrupting the transit.\"",

"story": "Report: Exercises for military deployment in Germany expected to start soon Exercises for an internal German military deployment could start as soon as November, a state interior minister has told media. The anti-terror drills involving Bundeswehr and police would be the first of their kind. Klaus Bouillon, the head of Germany's interior ministers' conference, said Bundeswehr anti-terror exercises could be approved by the end of the month, in an interview with the \"Rheinische Post\" on Saturday. \"I expect that Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen and Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere will greenlight the exercises on August 31,\" Bouillon, who is also the state of Saarland's interior minister, told the newspaper. \"Exercises could begin already in November for an internal Bundeswehr deployment,\" added the minister. So far, military and police exercises are planned in the German states of Saarland, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Saxony-Anhalt, the journalists' consortium \"Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland\" reported on Saturday. SPD shift on deployment Bouillon, who is a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) party, said that he believed the exercises would take place \"in the majority of states.\" Even states led by the Social Democrat party (SPD), which have opposed constitutional changes on the internal deployment of German armed forces in the past, are starting to shift, the interior ministers' conference chief said. \"I also see a movement in SPD-led states for cooperation between police and the Bundeswehr in case of terror and catastrophes,\" Bouillon said. Lower Saxony's SPD interior minister, Boris Pistorius, reportedly suggested in a letter to Bouillon that all of Germany's 16 states should conduct the police and military exercises together. Pistorius suggested that the exercises take place nationwide according to the law and under police command, \"Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland\" reported, quoting the letter. New military strategy Germany's constitution, in reaction to the misuse of the military for state-sponsored terror during the Nazi era, allows for domestic military deployments only under special circumstances, including natural disasters and imminent external threats. A 2012 Constitutional Court decision found that the Bundeswehr could also be deployed in the event of terrorist attacks. In July, the Defense Ministry confirmed the legal situation in its \"White Paper\" mapping out Germany's military strategy. The exercises would be the first cooperation between police and armed forces to prepare for terror attacks. Following a spate of violent attacks in Germany, some of which were claimed by the militant \"Islamic State\" group, Chancellor Merkel called for the internal deployment of the military if a major act of terrorism took place. rs/tj (AFP, dpa)",

"story": "Translator pay strike at Khmer Rouge genocide trial Translators have gone on strike at the genocide tribunal of Khmer Rogue leaders. The age of defendants such as 86-year-old Nuon Chea has raised concerns they may not live long enough for the world to hear verdicts. Claiming they had not received pay in three months, about 30 Cambodian staff members from the translation section announced their strike just before the court was to hear testimony from a foreign expert, postponing the proceedings indefinitely, according to tribunal spokesman Neth Pheaktra. He said the giving of testimony scheduled for this week and next week will wait until the pay dispute was resolved. Pheaktra said that countries funding the tribunal had not contributed on time. The UN pays the salaries of foreign workers; Cambodian employees are paid by the government. The translators are essential staff as the hearings use English, French and Cambodian. \"I appeal to the donor countries to help resolve the issue by providing more funds to the national side of the court,\" Pheaktra said. Pheaktra said that about $9.3 million (7 million euros) was needed for salaries and daily operating costs to fund the tribunal's Cambodian component through 2013. From 2006 to 2011, the tribunal spent $141.1 million. The total, when the tribunal concludes its work later this year, is estimated to be about $230 million, though Pheaktra said that there was the potential for shortfalls. The budgets for international staffers, adequate for now, could dry up by the middle of this year, he added. Japan has committed nearly $80 million to the trial so far. France, Germany and Britain are also major contributors. The tribunal was formed in 2006 to examine claims of atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge during its four years in power in the 1970s, when an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians died from forced labor, starvation, medical neglect and execution. Only chief jailer convicted Three leaders have stood trial since 2011, charged with crimes against humanity and genocide: Khieu Samphan, the 81-year-old former head of state; Nuon Chea, the group's 86-year-old chief ideologist; and Ieng Sary, 87, the former foreign minister, who was hospitalized on Monday. \"He vomited every time he was given food,\" his lawyer, Ang Udom, told the news agency AFP. \"He is very weak now.\" Former Social Affairs minister Ieng Thirith was deemed mentally unfit and set free. Only the chief jailer, Kaing Guek Eav, has been convicted by the tribunal so far. He is serving a life sentence. Officials have sought to prosecute other former Khmer Rouge leaders, but Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has led Cambodia since 1985, has ruled out any more trials. Many in Cambodia's government, including Hun, are former Khmer Rouge officials. The Swiss judge Laurent Kasper-Ansermet resigned last March, claiming official interference into his efforts to investigate suspects. mkg/ipj (AFP, dpa, AP)",

"story": "Eurozone wants tough mechanism to defend stability of the euro European Union leaders are working around the clock to create a new measure to defend the euro before financial markets reopen on Monday. EU finance ministers will meet on Sunday to discuss the plan. European Union leaders are working overtime to construct new crisis defense mechanisms to safeguard the euro currency and crack down on market speculation before the Asian financial markets reopen on Monday. On Sunday, European Union finance ministers debated proposals to set up a 600 billion euro ($765 billion) rescue fund for member countries states that fall into financial trouble, said diplomats in Brussels. The package would consist funds raised by the EU's executive, the European Commission, loans from eurozone states; and money from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), diplomats said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was holding a crisis cabinet meeting in Berlin late Sunday, to deal with the consequences of a prospective rescue system being negotiated in Brussels,officials said. A clear signal \"Taking into account the exceptional circumstances, the European Commission will propose a European stabilization mechanism to preserve financial stability in Europe,\" Herman Van Rompuy , the president of the EU, said in a statement released in the early hours of Saturday morning. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the move will send \"a very clear signal\" to market speculators by creating a common fund to support economies in difficulty. The European portion of the bailout will amount to some 80 billion euros ($102 billion) over three years, with Germany set to provide the lion's share.The IMF has approved 30 billion Euro loan for Greece. Despite the 110 billion euro bailout, financial markets reacted negatively to the continued uncertainty, prompting EU leaders to consider new steps to prevent similar financial chaos from spreading to other member states. The unprecedented Greek bailout is due to be transferred to Athens within days. Greeks oppose cuts The emergency summit in Brussels coincided with ceremonies to commemorate the end of World War II in Europe, forcing some European leaders to cancel their plans to attend the events. French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi have both pulled out of Sunday's war commemorations in Russia to deal with the financial crisis, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel has arrived in Moscow and will attend the ceremonies. Investors are keeping a close watch on Greek opposition to Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou's austerity plans, concerned that prolonged protests could weaken his resolve to push through the cuts passed by the Greek parliament on Thursday. On Saturday, opinion polls showed a majority of Greeks support further protests against the austerity measures. smh/AFP/AP/dpa Editor: Rick Demarest",

"story": "Clash between Nigerian military, Shiite sect leaves scores dead Nigeria's military has killed hundreds of Shiite Muslims, in weekend clashes between a rebellious sect and troops. The military says that the raids came after hundreds blocked the army chief's convoy and threatened him. Soldiers killed hundreds of Shiite Muslims this weekend, after the group opened fire on the Nigerian army chief's convoy, according to the Shia Islamic Movement and military officials. Witness Ojo Momodu told the Associated Press that the Shiites had barricaded the road with burning tires as the army chief approached. They then hurled stones at his convoy. A report from the Nigerian Army Corps of Military Police said Shiite militants were hiding in tall grass \"with the intent to attack the vehicle with [a] petrol bomb,\" while others \"suddenly resorted to firing gunshots from the direction of the mosque.\" Retribution was apparently swift. Chidi Odinkalu of the Nigerian Human Rights Commission said that photos showed a bulldozer tearing apart a shrine of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria and said that detained leader Ibraheem Zakzaky's home was also destroyed the next day. Zakzaky was detained after being shot and injured by troops. His condition and whereabouts remain unclear. His sect's spokesman, Ibrahim Musa, accused the military of indiscriminate killing. \"The killing was so brutal \u2026 even those injured in the shooting were identified and killed in cold blood by the soldiers,\" he said. A hospital in the city of Zaria reported receiving 60 bodies, according to hospital chief Lawal Khalid. \"I was briefed that the hospital had received 60 corpses, but I am yet to be briefed on the current number,\" Khalid told the private News Agency of Nigeria. But it has been impossible to independently verify the toll as the military has locked down the area, preventing access. Iran and US both seek answers Reaction to reports of mass carnage have prompted questions from diplomats from both Washington and Tehran. The US embassy in Abuja was seeking more information State Department spokesman John Kriby said that Washington would continue to call for the protection of civilians and respect for human rights. Iran summoned Nigeria's charge d'affaires to protest, the official IRNA news agency reported Tuesday. Iran \"demands the Nigerian government immediately shed light on the incidents, treat the injured, and compensate for damages,\" IRNA said. Shiite minority past victim of attacks Zakzaky's movement draws inspiration from the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Shiite Iran. But most of Nigeria's tens of millions of Muslims are Sunni, including the Boko Haram jihadist militants who have killed thousands in bombings and shootings, mainly in northeastern Nigeria. A similar clash between followers of the Shiite sect and the army occurred last year during a procession. Zakzaky said that 30 followers and three of his children were killed by troops. jar/msh (AP, dpa, Reuters)",

"story": "State of fear: The Republican debate after San Bernardino Ban Muslims from entering the US; stop settling Syrian refugees; broaden NSA surveillance. The leading Republican candidates are calling for sweeping measures after the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino. Events in Los Angeles set the tone for the debate among Republican presidential candidates. The superintendent at the second largest school district in the United States sent home 650,000 students after a bomb threat was made by email. Authorities have now said the threat was a hoax and that classes will resume on Wednesday. Hours after the massive school closure, 10 Republican presidential candidates gathered in Las Vegas to debate national security. The United States was already on edge after the terrorist attacks in Paris and a shooting by Islamist extremists in San Bernardino has created an atmosphere of fear not seen in 14 years. According to a New York Times/CBS poll, Americans are more concerned about terrorism than at anytime since the September 11, 2001, attacks. During Tuesday's debate, the three leading Republican candidates variously called for sweeping measures. They included a temporary ban on Muslims entering the US, suspending the settlement of Syrian refugees and a return of the National Security Agency's bulk metadata program. Trump: Ban Muslims, Restrict the Internet Donald Trump has surged in a national poll of Republican primary voters after calling for \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\" According to Monmouth University, the real estate mogul crushes his closest rival, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, with a 27 point lead. The billionaire's Republican competitors have condemned his plan against Muslims. Trump, however, was under no pressure to back down during the debate in Las Vegas. According to a Washington Post/ABC poll, nearly 60 percent of Republican voters agree with him. \"A month ago things changed,\" Trump said. \"Radical Islamic terrorism came into effect even more so than it has in the past. We've opened up a very big discussion that needed to be opened up.\" The Republican front-runner also defended his recent call for \"closing that Internet up in some way\" in order to prevent \"Islamic State\" from recruiting via social media. He sought to qualify his previous statements by saying the focus would be on users in Iraq and Syria. \"I would certainly be open to closing areas where we are at war with somebody,\" Trump said. \"I sure as hell don't want to let people that want to kill us and kill our nation use our Internet.\" On the war in Syria, Trump rejected regime change for the time being, saying the focus should be on fighting \"Islamic State.\" \"We can't be fighting Assad,\" Trump said. \"When you're fighting Assad, you're fighting Russia - you're fighting a lot of different groups.\" Cruz: No refugees for three years Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has edged out Trump in the early voting state of Iowa, despite being distant second place in the national polls. During the debate on Tuesday, Cruz distanced himself from Trump's call to ban Muslims from entering the United States, without directly condemning it. \"There are millions of peaceful Muslims across the world, in countries like India, where there is not the problems we are seeing in nations that...have territory controlled by Al Qaida or ISIS,\" Cruz said. The Texas senator has drafted legislation that would place a three-year moratorium on taking in refugees \"from countries where ISIS or Al Qaida control substantial territory.\" Cruz also defended his vote in the Senate to end the National Security Agency's bulk collection of metadata in the United States, saying surveillance should be targeted against \"bad guys.\" He called for a foreign policy that shuns regime change and sending weapons to \"mythical moderate rebels,\" pointing to the 2011 overthrow of Moammar Gadhafi. \"Well, the result is, Libya is now a terrorist war zone run by jihadists,\" Cruz said. Cruz doubled down on his call for \"carpet bombing\" Islamic State. When asked whether he would target urban centers with civilians such as Raqqa, Cruz said \"the object isn't to level a city.\" \"You would carpet bomb where ISIS is, not a city, but the location of the troops,\" he said. Rubio: More NSA surveillance Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who is emerging as a new establishment favorite as the campaign of Former Governor Jeb Bush fails to gain traction, defended the National Security Agency's surveillance programs, which Congress voted to restrict in the aftermath of the Edward Snowden revelations. Rubio said the US needed more tools to fight Islamic State. \"This is not just the most capable, it is the most sophisticated terror threat we have ever faced,\" Rubio said. \"We are now at a time when we need more tools, not less tools. The metadata program, was a valuable tool that we no longer have at our disposal.\" Rubio, who is currently polling third nationwide, called for a broader coalition of Arab states to fight Islamic State from the air and on the ground. The senator said President Barack Obama's nuclear deal with Iran has discouraged Sunni countries from playing a larger role in the US-led coalition. \"One major reason why they have not been willing to be a broader part of the coalition, and that is they have lost complete trust and confidence in this president,\" Rubio said. \"This president cut a deal with their mortal enemy, the Shia, in Iran.\" Bush: Engage with Arab world Once tipped as the favorite for the nomination, Bush is now polling at just 3 percent nationally, despite having raised over $100 million for his campaign. Bush has condemned Trump's rhetoric against Muslims more forcefully than most of the other Republican candidates. While that might win him approval among the general American public, it won't do him much good with Republican primary voters. \"Look, this is not a serious proposal,\" Bush said of Trump's plan to ban Muslims from entering the United States. \"In fact, it will push the Muslim world, the Arab world, away from us at a time when we need to re-engage with them to be able to create a strategy to destroy ISIS.\" Though the former governor has rebuked Trump's rhetoric, he previously said the United States should focus on admitting Syrian refugees who can prove they are Christian.",

"story": "Goalkeepers Could Be Key in Germany-Turkey Semi-Final Turkey may have stolen the show from Germany when it comes to fighting spirit at Euro 2008, but the Germans could still win their semi-final date because they appear to have the better goalkeeper. Jens Lehmann has defied the critics with good showings when it mattered, while Turkey have to cope with the suspension of Volkan Demirel and the erratic performance of his replacement Rustu Recber. Both men have spent long periods of the past season on the substitutes' bench, Lehmann at England's Arsenal and Recber at Fenerbahce. The 38-year-old Lehmann has risen to the occasion when it mattered, playing solidly in Germany's 1-0 win over Austria and also in Thursday's 3-2 quarter-final success against Portugal. \"The bigger the pressure the better Jens becomes. The last games showed that,\" said Germany goalkeeping coach Andreas Koepke. \"I didn't see Jens as critically as others. We have seen other goalkeepers make errors here. Jens was very strong against Austria. He played a very, very good match against Portugal. He is playing the way we expected him to do and is also a team leader.\" Lehmann has seemingly calmed down as the tournament progressed. He met the German media in a very aggressive mood at the start of Euro after criticism of his showings in tune-up games. In contrast, he was very relaxed earlier this week. Experience isn't everything While Lehmann only became Germany No. 1 ahead of the 2006 World Cup, Rustu's biggest moment was the third-place finish with Turkey at the 2002 World Cup. He is now only in goal owing to Volkan's red-card suspension and put in a mixed performance in the quarter-finals against Croatia, when he won his 117th cap. Rustu looked like he might be the villain of the piece when his blunder allowed Ivan Klasnic give Croatia the lead in the 119th minute, but Turkey levelled through Semih Senturk. Rustu ended up as the hero in the penalty shoot-out when his save from Mladen Petric clinched the upset in Vienna. \"Rustu is very experienced but not always good,\" said Germany defender Arne Friedrich of the 35-year-old. Rustu has said he will retire from the national team after Euro. Many in Germany expect Lehmann to do the same and give way to a younger man. New blood in training Currently, 30-year-old Robert Enke from Hanover and Bayer Leverkusen's Rene Adler, 23, are in the frame to continue Germany's tradition of great goalkeepers. Koepke readily admitted that the future was at stake and Enke and Adler were training hard in the Euro 2008 camp in case Lehmann gets injured. \"Both are doing a really good job. No one knows what happens after Euro. This is about positioning as well for after Euro -- and to be fully fit if something happens to Jens,\" said Koepke.",

"story": "Happy New Year: Alcohol is a neurotoxin We usually toast the New Year with sparkling wine or champagne - which even in small quantities has an impact on our health and brains. But what exactly happens in our body after we've enjoyed a drink? Champagne tastes good, lifts the mood, maybe makes you a bit talkative - and affects your brain and body. It starts being absorbed into the blood stream through the mucus membranes in your mouth before heading on into the small intestine. There it continues to be absorbed, and then passed from the blood system to the liver. \"The liver is the first main stop. It has enzymes that can break down the alcohol,\" Helmut K. Seitz, a German researcher from Heidelberg, said. The liver's job is to transport toxins out of the body, and alcohol is one of them. But alcohol's first pass through the liver it does not break it down completely - some reaches the other organs. \"This applies for example to the pancreas, muscles and bones - and leads to corresponding changes,\" Seitz said. Alcohol can worsen even cause more than 200 diseases. Rush to the head Too much alcohol in the body affects especially the brain: perception is distorted, judgment clouded, and ability to concentrate decreases. At the same time, inhibitions are lowered, and a pleasant carefree feeling may arise. But too much of a good thing can lead unconsciousness - especially excessive binge drinking reflects this. Depression and aggression become stronger. A sad fact from 2012: Worldwide alcohol abuse and accidents, and violence under the influence of alcohol, led to a person's death every 10 seconds: 3.3 million people died of alcohol. When alcohol circulates through the body, it takes about 6 minutes to arrive to the brain. \"Ethanol alcohol is a small molecule. It's in the blood, in all water - it is water soluble,\" Seitz said. \"The human body consists of 70 to 80 percent water. The alcohol is distributed throughout, and then goes into the brain.\" Alcohol affects the neurotransmitters, or substances that are transmitted via nerve endings in the central nervous system. Alcohol can lead to false or altered transmission, which can cause acute damage. If the situation is chronic - after excessive consumption of alcohol for years, or even decades - the damage becomes correspondingly worse. \"It disrupts vitamins and trace elements that play a large role in the central nervous system,\" Seitz said. For example, our brains require Vitamin B1. If it's missing, due to excessive alcohol consumption, this can lead to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. \"In the brain, the effects of alcohol abuse can lead to dementia,\" Seitz warned. Carcinogenic In mouth and throat, alcohol affects the mucus membranes - for example in the esophagus. The body can no longer protect those against toxins. This can have significant consequences, Seitz said, like serious inflammation of the pancreas. \"Let's think about cancer: tumors of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and esophagus, as well as liver or breast cancer,\" Seitz said. We often forget that alcohol is a risk factor for breast cancer, and also for the colon.\" Then there's cirrhosis of the liver. AS alcohol is metabolized in the liver, toxins are produced, which damage the liver cells. Approximately twenty to thirty thousand people die due to liver cirrhosis in Germany every year. \"Alcohol is metabolized by the liver, and then you think the poison is gone,\" Seitz explained. \"But an intermediate metabolite can even cause hereditary defects.\" Alcohol around the world In Germany, almost 12 liters of pure alcohol are consumed per capita per year. This corresponds to the equivalent of 500 bottles of beer - per person. In the United Kingdom and Slovenia, this is only slightly less, at 11.6 liters. But people in Ireland and Luxembourg drink even more than Germans: 11.9 liters on average, according to a World Health Organization study. Belarus takes a questionable first place: 17.5 liters of pure alcohol are consumed there annually. Countries such as Pakistan, Kuwait, Libya and Mauritania are at the bottom of the scale, with 0.1 liters per person per year. A very different situation prevails in some Asian countries. About 40 percent of all Japanese, Korean and Chinese people are missing an enzyme that breaks down acetaldehyde, which is an important prerequisite for the reducing alcohol in the body. \"Alcohol is converted to acetaldehyde, and acetaldehyde to acetic acid. But if acetaldehyde is not converted to acetic acid, then acetaldehyde accumulates,\" Seitz said. Asians who cannot process alcohol due to their genetic disposition can get headache, nausea, vomiting and tremors - and their faces become red. But alcohol also has a good side: \"It has a favorable effect on atherosclerosis, or the hardening of the blood vessels.\" Seitz said. He recommended a glass of wine a day, especially for people at risk of heart attack or stroke. Even Paracelsus knew that: The physician, healer and theologian preached at the beginning of the 16th century: \"All things are poison and nothing is without poison; only the dose makes a thing not a poison.\" So, as with many things: alcohol in moderation.",

"story": "China trade figures uninspiring Chinese trading activities have taken a beating in recent weeks, official figures have shown. Both sales abroad and imports logged a hefty drop, leaving economists wondering about the nation's growth prospects. China's exports contracted by a staggering 15 percent in March year-on-year, the General Administration of Customs reported Monday. The tumble in shipments abroad marked the sharpest monthly dip since the global financial crisis. It came against the backdrop of a 12-percent rise in exports penciled in by economists. Analysts said the decline was heightening worries about how a rising yuan had hurt demand for Chinese goods and services abroad. Worrying signals Providing a sign that domestic demand was also tepid in the Asian nation, imports into the world's second-largest economy shrunk by 12.7 percent in March year-on-year, the customs agency announced, the biggest slump since May 2009. \"[The figures] lead to warning flags both on global demand and China's competitiveness,\" RBS economist Louis Kuijs told Reuters. The government in Beijing wants to protect jobs, knowing that higher unemployment could fuel social unrest, but anemic growth in the trade sector could hurt the labor market. So far, though, the jobs market appears to be holding up well despite signs that economic growth is steadily grinding to its lowest in a quarter of a century, nearing the 7-percent mark. hg/jil (AFP, dpa)",

"story": "Bhopal Gas Leak: 25 Years on Shortly after midnight on December 2, 1984, the Indian city of Bhopal witnessed the world\u2019s worst industrial disaster. Toxic fumes escaped from a pesticide factory owned by the US firm Union Carbide Corporation and engulfed the homes of thousands of residents, killing many in their sleep. As many as 3,000 people died in a single night - over 22,000 in the days and years that followed. 25 years later, the catastrophe in Bhopal is far from over. While survivors still have to cope with the long-term effects of being exposed to the gas, the disaster also has consequences for the city's newer residents. A few kilometers away from the city centre in Bhopal, an abandoned factory lies in ruins. This factory, formerly owned by the US-based firm Union Carbide Corporation, gave off toxic fumes on the night of December 2, 1984 which killed over 3,000 people. Today the factory premises are unused. In 1989 a controversial court ruling cleared the firm of all liability with regard to the incident. For residents living in the slums nearby, the sight of the derelict factory is a constant reminder of the disaster that hit them on a dark night 25 years ago. Satinath Sarangi, the director of the Sambhavna Trust Clinic for gas victims, says the impact of the catastrophe is still there for all to see. \u201cToday, in many ways the conditions are worse than how it was on the morning of the disaster. More than 100,000 people are suffering from chronic illnesses related to the toxic gas exposure. Then there are tens of thousands of children born to gas-exposed parents with a range of growth and developmental disorders. And also in the last 25 years people who lost their health also lost their ability to work and earn a livelihood, which has meant starvation conditions for thousands of families, because the government has not provided any kind of economic rehabilitation support.\u201d Groundwater pollution But it is not just through the long-term effects of gas-exposure that the repercussions of the disaster are being felt. The Union Carbide Factory in Bhopal dumped thousands of tons of toxins at the site. The poison continues to pollute groundwater and thus expose the residents to still more danger. In an official statement on the disaster put up on its website, Union Carbide maintains that it has spent two million dollars on clean-up efforts at the site. Yet a study released on December 1 by an independent research organisation, the Centre for Science and Environment, shows that groundwater at and near the factory site contains almost 40 times more pesticides than the average for India. Soil and water samples taken in areas as far as 3 kilometres away from the site show harmful substances including heavy metals like mercury and chromium in high concentrations. The residents of nearby slums use hand pumps or bore wells to extract their drinking water from the ground. It is of course heavily contaminated and is having a negative impact on health, says Ram Bai, a resident of the area. \u201cFor 25 years we have been drinking this polluted water, we have no access to clean water,\u201d says Ram Bai. \u201cThere are constant illnesses here. That is why we demand our right to clean water. We have lived most of our lives, but we want to secure a better future at least for the children now being born here.\u201d Birth defects among newborns The high level of chemicals present in the water is leading to a rising number of birth defects in new-born children. This can be witnessed even among people who moved to Bhopal after the disaster and were not exposed to the harmful gas. According to Satinath Sarangi of Sambhavna Trust, more children are born with developmental defects in this area than in any other comparable population. Yet an alternate source of water is still not available. In 2004, the Supreme Court of India directed the state government in Madhya Pradesh to provide clean drinking water to the settlements near the factory site. Now a water pipeline has been built, but local activists say the water does not reach all of the settlements on a regular basis. Moreover, some of the slum-dwellers have been told it is a private water supply and that they have to pay to use it. Outside the premises of the Union Carbide factory, women have gathered to shout slogans in protest at the conduct of the Madhya Pradesh state government. A few days ahead of the 25th anniversary of the disaster, the state government went so far as to deny that there was any toxic contamination at the site. The women in these settlements now want the world to know that while the catastrophe may have occurred a long time ago, their struggle for basic rights like health care and clean drinking water is far from over.

"story": "Greece's woes reveal a 'democracy crisis' in Europe: political scientist J\u00fcrgen Neyer Political scientist J\u00fcrgen Neyer sees parliamentary democracy in a crisis of its own, with two different concepts of democracy crashing into each other. The financial misery in Greece is making this visible, he told DW. DW: What light is being shed on democracy right now in Europe by the debt crisis? The debt crisis is drawing attention to fundamentally different ideas of democracy that exist in Europe. We have the old or classical concept, which identifies democracy with the traditional sense of sovereignty of a people. We can still see this within Greece, where a society decides on its own via a democratic election how it should live. This idea is simply not viable in contemporary Europe. We have a plurality of societies existing simultaneously that are beginning to develop and grow together on account of the central institutional system. The main question now doesn't necessarily concern Greek debt or how Athens is going to repay its bills, but rather the extent to which Greece is ready to cooperate and follow the rules in this European system. Which concept of democracy prevails in the European Union? The societies are holding to their own rights for self-determination in their own politics. This means that the Germans don't decide on their own anymore, the French don't decide on their own anymore, the Greeks don't decide on their own anymore, because they have to take into consideration how the rules that have been agreed to will affect each nation. This hinders national sovereignty drastically. What role do institutions such as the European Central Bank play? There are portions of politics that are simply removed from the parliamentary process. For competition policy, the European Commission is responsible, and for financial and currency policy the European Central Bank is the main player. We confer responsibility to so-called independent agencies, which means we give influence to the \"experts.\" This is extremely difficult to merge with the classical understanding of democracy. And I must say that the current crisis in Greece has been integral in exposing this. How should this institutional and political apparatus change to favor more democracy? The question is initially whether the societies in Europe even want more sovereignty. If they do want this, then they will have to part, to a certain extent, with the shared European rules. And if 28 different societies want to both co-exist and decide for themselves how to live, you can imagine how hard it would be to come up with shared rules. There must be an array of options on the table. Does Europe want to move in the direction of a federal republic and treat Greece, for example, like Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and the Saarland, as a kind of federal welfare state? Or does Europe want to become a collection of national states? Or would a third concept work better? This kind of fundamental discussion about political order is not exactly taking place at the moment. Do political parties like the Alternative for Germany (AfD) or the leftist Podemos in Spain or Syriza in Greece have an important function? These are indeed very important. I am not a sympathizer with any of these kinds of parties, but at the same time, it must be said that they are the ones sticking their finger into the sore spot of the European integration process. And this process needs urgent political attention. J\u00fcrgen Neyer teaches at the European University Viadrina in Frankfurt (Oder). His area of concentration is the institutional order of the European Union. This interview was conducted by Andreas Gorzewski.",

"story": "Hertha Berlin are hoping cleverness can make up for lack of cash Money=transfers=success. That's the football formula last season's fourth-placed team is trying to disprove. DW-WORLD's Jefferson Chase looks at whether Hertha Berlin can solve a tough equation. There won't be any record signings in the German capital this summer. In 2008-09, Hertha Berlin broke out of the mid-table doldrums and earned more points than ever before, but if you think that would be cause for a spending spree, you don't know Hertha's books. The \"old lady,\" as the club is known, is bent on reducing its personnel costs by five million euros ($7 million). That's led to the departures of the squad's two top strikers, Marko Pantelic and Andriy Voronin, and the consensus choice for the Bundesliga's best defensive player last year, Josip Simunic. In fact, Hertha only have around 25 million euros in total for players - significantly less than one-third of what Real Madrid paid to pry Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United. Conventional wisdom would say that Hertha are heading for a precipitous fall this autumn. But the club thinks it can build on last season's success and balance the books - thanks to a new general manager, a no-nonsense strategist as a coach and at least one very unorthodox acquisition. Second chance for King Artur Hertha's main move thus far - other than selling Simunic for seven million euros - is to bring back one of the most reviled former players in recent years: striker Artur Wichniarek. The Polish forward spent two hapless years in the capital from 2003 to 2005, scoring just four goals in 44 appearances. Hertha have chosen to ignore that bleak bit of the past for two reasons: Wichniarek's record at his former club Bielefeld is impressive - 83 goals in 207 matches - and he's keen. King Artur's lack of success in the capital reportedly gnawed at him so much that he was willing to fork out a quarter of a million euros of his own money to buy himself out of his Bielefeld contract and take another crack at conquering Berlin. Hertha also have two promising but largely untested young forwards - Valeri Domovchiyski and Armine Chermiti - who they hope can make quantum leaps in 2009-10. But the weight of expectations - and the habitual skepticism of Hertha's supporters - will be on Wichniarek, who ended his last tenure in Berlin in utter acrimony and whose return was only made possible by the departure of a former enemy. Hoeness out, Preetz in Hertha's first move of the off-season was to oust Dieter Hoeness as its long-time general manager. When the former Bayern striker came to the club in 1996, it was struggling to stay in the second division. Under Hoeness, Hertha quickly established itself in the top flight and once even qualified for the Champions League. But Hoeness came under increasing pressure for some expensive transfer flops (chiefly Brazilian strikers) and for his propensity to make grandiose pronouncements in the media. The fact that impecunious Hertha were willing to part with a million euros to get him to resign in June is a sign of how much the club wanted him gone. Hertha's all-time leading goal scorer Michael Preetz has taken over, inheriting both Hoeness' achievements and some 25 million euros in debts that he racked up while trying to heave Berlin into the upper echelons of European soccer. During his career on the pitch, Preetz was known as an efficient, but also affable and intelligent player so there's reason to believe he can be convincing with potential signees. But more importantly, he gets on well with the man who has now been given unprecedented power to form the squad - coach Lucien Favre. Lulu's baby In only two seasons with the club, \"Lulu\" Favre has completely remade Hertha. Only five players remain from the squad he took over in 2007, and the Swiss coach has focused on building up a multi-talented, young midfield. Serbian Gojko Kacar and Brazilians Cicero and Raffael in particular impressed last season, scoring 19 goals between them. Manchester United are rumored to be keeping Kacar under observation and are said to believe that the 22-year-old all-rounder is worth at least 12 million euros. Hertha also reportedly turned down a 10-million-euro offer from French side Olympique Lyon for Raffael. Basically Hertha believe that with that trio, plus German national defender Arne Friedrich and rock-steady keeper Jaroslav Drobny, the squad has a solid core capable of improving next season. And Favre's insistence that his charges be capable of playing multiple positions means that he's better able to compensate for injuries and suspensions than most coaches. Still, expectations are one thing, and results another, and many teams have been burned when younger players didn't make the progress their bosses envisioned for them. If Hertha are able to maintain or surpass their level of play last season while cutting the budget, it will solidify Favre's argument that he is building a team of the future. But if the goals don't come up front, or the back four folds without Simunic, or the midfield trio stagnates, Hertha could find itself having to borrow some money in mid-season just to stave off collapse.

"story": "Bundesliga: Mario Gomez at the double as Stuttgart go seven unbeaten A return to the international fold was celebrated in style as Stuttgart grabbed another three points on the road. The win lifts them to eighth in the table and an outside shot at European qualification. Freiburg 1-2 Stuttgart, Schwarzwald-Stadion (Petersen 53' \u2014 Gomez 4', 75') Never mind a return to the national squad, on this evidence, Gomez will have given Germany coach Jogi L\u00f6w plenty to chew as he considers his starting XI to face Spain next Friday night. The veteran striker staked his claim with a brace that gave Stuttgart a sixth win in their last seven league games, lifting the club into European contention. It also showed why he remains one of the best around when it comes to giving himself that crucial yard of space in the penalty area. His first goal arrived in only the fourth minute of a boisterous encounter, which often lacked quality but rarely lacked passion. Gomez drifted into space to meet Dennis Aogo's inswinging freekick to give the visitors a flying start. He should have doubled his side's lead in the 13th minute. A poorly placed Robin Koch backpass sent the 32-year old clean through, but he failed to make decent contact. It looked as if he might live to regret it, too, after another experienced German striker leveled the contest with a moment of brilliance. Nils Petersen has genuine cause to feel aggrieved at not being called-up for Germany's pre-World Cup friendlies. He is, after all, the highest scoring German in the Bundesliga this season, and his goal here was disptached with sublime efficiency. After racing onto Nicolas H\u00f6fler's through-ball, the Freiburg captain took a touch away from a chasing defender and lifted the ball deftly over the oustretched fingertips of Ron-Robert Zieler. It was his 13th league goal of the campaign. But it was Gomez, and Stuttgart, who would have the last laugh. When Andreas Beck's searching cross in the 75th minute found the former Bayern man, the outcome was inevitable. His initial header was straight at Alexander Schwolow, but ricocheted straight back to him for the simplest of winners. Stuttgart find themselves just three points off Europa League qualification, with seven games still to play. An already dramatic battle for European places just found a new contender.",

"story": "A Personal Transatlantic Relationship While President Bush's visit to Europe dominates the headlines, many people are taking cues from the transatlantic political relationship and building bridges themselves. \"In the last few years, I've really become a fan of America,\" said Florens Focke, a German exchange student in the United States, adding that he was more nervous about meeting his host family than how US-German politics would play out in his daily life. Focke labels himself more conservative than most Germans, but he says he doesn't always agree with his host country's foreign policy. He wants to use his year-long exchange to a small town outside Dayton, Ohio, to learn about Americans' opinions on their country's position in the world. Others, like Focke, in both Germany and the USA haven't been put off by international politics -- even when the German-American relationship was stretched to its thinnest -- but they have had an effect. Seeking dialog \"Some personal relationships may have suffered so that they are not the same as before,\" said Michael Schuster, president of the Confederation of German-American Clubs, a group that sponsors about 30 exchanges each year. \"But even when times are unpleasant, we have to work through them and seek a dialog to improve contact between people.\" German interest in studying in the US has fallen since the run-up to the war in Iraq. For the 2003/2004 school year 8,745 Germans chose to study there, a 6 percent drop from the previous year, according to a November 2004 report from the Institute of International Education (IIE) in New York. The decline has actually been much sharper, according to Katrin Alt-Rudin, head of the exchange and education team at the Amerika Haus in Munich. She said there have been about 30 percent fewer inquiries regarding the United States, while interest in Australia, Canada and New Zealand is growing. It's not exclusively political concerns that make students look to other English-speaking countries. Difficulties getting a visa and the high cost of education in the US also contribute to a shrinking interest in studying there, said Christian Sch\u00e4fer of the German Academic Exchange Service. Bucking a general downward trend, the number of Americans who entered Germans schools or universities in 2002/2003 jumped 15 percent to 5,587, making Germany the seventh choice for Americans studying abroad, according to the IIE report. Separating individuals from policy Eric Schranz, 33, an American scientist doing postdoctoral research in plant genetics at the Max Planck Institute of Chemical Ecology in Jena, came to Germany just as the US was gearing up for war in Iraq. He had reservations about saying where he came from when he arrived in Germany, which bitterly opposed the war, two years ago. At first I thought twice before admitting my nationality,\" Schranz said. \"Then I happily realized people universally said, 'It's not you as an American we have a problem with but the policies of the country.'\" Separating people from policies is a typical German trait while Americans tend to take criticism more personally, according to John Magee of The Magee Company, which specializes in matters of transatlantic integration. \"Americans feel if you criticize my country, you criticize my family,\" he said. Reactions in the United States were mainly positive when German exchange student Focke brought up his nationality, but he also faced questions -- though never personal affronts -- about Germany's role in the Second World War as well as its decision not to get involved in Iraq. \"I explain that being German doesn't make you a Nazi, and that Germany's history with the Second World War still influences its decisions about war,\" Focke said. \"Usually people understand.\"",

"story": "Women's World Cup gender tests 'ridiculous' Female athletes are increasingly forced to pass gender verification tests. Medical ethicist Claudia Wiesemann says the tests are not just \"ridiculous,\" but can have humiliating consequences. DW: The German Women's National Soccer Team had to supply medical confirmation that all players were indeed women in order to be allowed to play in the Women's World Cup in Canada this summer. What does \"gender verification\" entail? Is it just a little peek down where the sun doesn't shine? Claudia Wiesemann: Well, at first it was, in the 50s and 60s. Back then, it was a purely phyiscal test. Later, it was examined whether the athletes had two X chromosomes. Men usually have an X and a Ychromosome. Then came more thorough physical tests, which included an exam of the organs in the abdomen. Today, hormone levels are tested in the blood - so how much testosterone a woman has in her blood. Is it complicated to measure that? Not really. It's pretty easy to examine testosterone levels. What's harder is interpreting the results. Why is that? There's no such thing as definite gender verification. Women can have very high levels of testosterone, but their bodies can be completely insensitive to the effects. Some people are more sensitive to testosterone, others less. Women can even have a Y chromosome and still have a female physique. Men and women are merely two extremes of a continuum, and, between these extremes, many different types are possible. How have attitudes developed within international sports associations? The International Olympic Committee (IOC,) for example, has introduced rules regarding testosterone levels. That was the IOC's way of reacting to massive criticism of previous tests, which were discriminating and didn't yield accurate results. But the testosterone examination is no different. In order for a woman to compete in a women's competition, the IOC demands she has lower testosterone levels than a man. But that's a purely arbitrary cut-off. There are women who undoubtedly grew up as females, but have higher-than-average testosterone levels. That makes them better athletes - just like a man who's taller than two meters (6'6'') is a better basketball player, because he's taller than average. Supporters of gender verification say that if women with heightened testosterone levels compete alongside other female athletes, it's unfair and distorts the competition. How do you respond to that? A physical advantage will always influence how the competition goes. That's also true for the basketball player who's taller than two meters, but we'd never entertain the idea of disqualifying him because of an unfair advantage. We have to provide a reason why a certain advantage is so unfair that it merits disqualification. Additionally, we have to think about the damage we'd be doing by excluding someone from the competition because of a purportedly wrong gender. What kind of detrimental effect could that have? There can be major damage. One female athlete from India [Santhi Soundarajan, eds. note] was publicly called a liar and a cheater when a gender verification exam showed she had a Y chromosome. She tried to kill herself because of the hostility and humiliation that ensued. How often do intersexual people whose gender cannot biologically be determined, face this issue? That's a big problem for them. The fact that intersex individuals exist is not widely known in society. Instead, most people think that it should be easy to tell the difference between man and woman. While that's true for 99.9 percent of cases, it's not the case for the remaining 0.1 percent. Going back to the German Women's National Team: According to media reports, the players had to present a kind of medical certificate from their gynecologists, confirming that they are indeed all women. What do you think about that? I find it disastrous that national associations are participating in this madness. They really are in a tough situation, though. They can't suddenly protest and say \"Fine, then we're not coming\" right before such an important competition. That's the perfidious aspect of the international associations' policy. They're simply passing the buck to the national associations. And they in turn pass that pressure on to the athletes, saying: \"Either you participate in this pseudo-medical exam, or you can't compete.\" Claudia Wiesemann is a medical ethicist and director of the Institute for Ethics and History of Medicine at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.",

"story": "US executes man despite disability claim A man has been executed in the US after a final appeal by his lawyers who said he was intellectually disabled was turned down. Warren Hill was killed by lethal injection in the southeastern state of Georgia. The 54-year-old murderer was initially sentenced to life imprisonment for killing his 18-year-old girlfriend in 1986, whom he shot 11 times. While serving that sentence, however, Hill beat fellow inmate Joseph Handspike to death using a nail-studded board. In 1991, Hill was convicted of Handspike's murder and sentenced to death. His execution was delayed three times between July 2012 and July 2013 following various challenges. In their final appeal, Hill's lawyers argued that his execution was prohibited by the Constitution because he was intellectually disabled. According to Hill's representatives, he had an IQ of 70 and the mental capacity of an 11-year-old. A number of experts and state doctors had also testified to Hill's mental disability. The Supreme Court turned down the appeal, however, after the court voted 7-2 to not take up the petition. Despite being the first US state to ban the execution of mentally disabled inmates, critics say Georgia has the toughest standard for proving intellectual disability in the US. Global calls for mercy The European Union (EU), lawyers and doctors, as well as public figures including former US president Jimmy Carter, had also called for mercy for Hill. \"This execution is an abomination,\" said Hill's attorney Brian Kammer, following the Supreme Court's decision not to take up Hill's petition. \"Today, the court has unconscionably allowed a grotesque miscarriage of justice to occur in Georgia. \"The memory of Mr. Hill's illegal execution will live on as a moral stain on the people of this state and on the courts that allowed this to happen.\" According to the Death Penalty Information Center, Hill was the fifth US inmate executed this year and the second in Georgia. ksb/bw (Reuters, AFP, AP)",

"story": "German Social Democrats Question EU Report on CIA Scandal Members of Germany Social Democratic Party on Tuesday criticized a report by an EU Parliament commission that could damage their party colleague, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier. In its report on CIA activities in Europe, a special cross-party European committee among other things accuses the former German government under Gerhard Schr\u00f6der of not having worked hard enough for the release of a German-born Turk from the US prison camp at Guantanamo. The report increases the political pressure on Steinmeier, who was chief of staff in the chancellery office at the time and whose former activities are currently also being investigated by a parliamentary inquiry in Berlin. Reacting to the allegations of the European Parliament commission, Germany's Social Democratic parliamentary floor leader Peter Struck said that he questioned the committee's allegations that Steinmeier had turned down an offer by US authorities to take German-born Turk Murat Kurnaz back to Germany in 2002 after he was found innocent during interrogations at the Guantanamo prison camp. Struck said that he was not aware of any evidence of such an offer ever being made by the United States. He added that the EU committee had based its findings only on newspaper reports while the confidential government documents available to him spoke a different language. Struck's view is shared by SPD general secretary Hubertus Heil, who denied that Steinmeier should be blamed. Speedy resolution? \"We want to investigate the whole matter without delay,\" he said. \"And this has to be done in the appropriate committees of the German parliament. Then everyone will see that there can be no doubt about the foreign minister's integrity.\" A Social Democratic inquiry panel member, Thomas Oppermann, also said that any allegation that the former government had actively prevented the release of Kurnaz is far from the truth. He did say, though, that there was an active exchange of views about Kurnaz' future between German and US intelligence officers. \"What I can see from the documents made available to me is that there were indeed discussions between German and US intelligence agents about whether or not to release Murat Kurnaz from Guantanamo on condition that he would be planted as a mole in Germany's radical Islamic scene,\" he said. \"But these discussions alone cannot be construed as an official offer by US authorities to release Kurnaz.\" Inhuman attitudes? Next week, the Kurnaz case will be debated at length at a special meeting of a German parliamentary committee responsible for checking the intelligence agencies' activities. Meanwhile Germany's mass circulation tabloid Bild has asked why the former government should have cared at all about a Turk who had no German citizenship. The chairman of the parliamentary probe, Siegfried Kauder, was outraged by such comments. \"To ask why should we bother about this Turk at all is inhuman,\" he said. \"After all, Kurnaz grew up in Germany. And if the government thought they shouldn't be concerned, they should have informed Kurnaz' lawyer so that he'd be able to seek help elsewhere. But to convey the impression that one cares and then do nothing would be inhuman.\" The German public has been hearing about the Kurnaz case for many weeks and now there's an expectation that Steinmeier will act to clear up the matter speedily. However, he's unlikely to testify to the inquiry panel before March after all witnesses have been heard.",

"story": "Vatican will take over Knights of Malta following condom row Pope Francis requested Grand Master Matthew Festing to step down from the Knights of Malta. The decision comes during an ongoing argument between church liberals and conservatives over the use of condoms. Grand Master Matthew Festing is out of the Knights of Malta following a request by Pope Francis. \"The Grand Master was received on Tuesday by Pope Francis who requested his resignation, which the Grand Master agreed to,\" a spokesman for the Order told French press agency AFP. Festing's resignation still must be confirmed by the Knights of Malta's sovereign council, which is scheduled to convene on Saturday. The Vatican said a papal delegate would be named to lead the Order. Condoms at the forefront Grand Masters of the Knights of Malta are usually in the position for life, but the disagreement over the use of condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS, and the controversy following the removal of Knights' Grand Chancellor Albrecht Freiherr von Boeselager for allowing the distribution of condoms in the Order's humanitarian aid agency pushed Francis into action. Festing also claimed in a leaked letter that three Vatican appointees had a conflict of interest due to links to a Geneva-based fund the Order also had a stake in. It appears the defiance of papal authority was the final straw. Von Boeselager was health minister of the order when the Malteser International was found to have distributed condoms in Myanmar under his watch. The church forbids the use of condoms or other forms of artificial contraception. Von Boeselager said he shut down two programs in Myanmar but kept a third going as it was the only supplier of basic medical services for needy people. Liberals vs. conservatives Von Boeselager's dismissal is seen as being due to him being too liberal for Cardinal Raymond Burke, a conservative figure from the US and the Vatican. Burke has been outspoken in his views, which directly contrast with Pope Francis. Francis, as well as his predecessor Benedict XVI, said the use of condoms to preserve life is acceptable in AIDS-ravaged communities. The Knights of Malta was founded in Jerusalem in 1048 as a community of hospitals. After it was recognized by the pope in 1113, it now operates in 120 countries with 13,500 members and 100,000 employees and volunteers. kbd/rc (AFP, AP, Reuters)",

"story": "Still a long way to go for Greece As Greece prepares to accept new austerity measures, questions have arisen about the ECB's methods. A controversial bond swap is intended to cut Greek debt, but could be a subsidy in disguise. The measures promised by Greece in order to save an additional 3.3 billion euros ($4.3 billion) appear rather drastic at first glance. Salaries are to be frozen for several years, the minimum wage is to be reduced by 22 percent and the defense budget is to be cut by 300 million euros. Soldiers, police officers, judges, state doctors, and diplomats will face wage cuts as of July, and 15,000 civil servants will be axed at the end of 2012. Large shares of state-owned gas and oil companies, the state lottery, and the waterworks for the Athens and Thessaloniki region are to be sold off by the beginning of July. The Greek parliament is to endorse the new austerity package on Sunday. But even if eurozone finance ministers approve further funding in return, Greece is far from saved. It is still unclear whether Greece's private creditors will agree to a 70 percent haircut on Greek government bonds, currently valued at 205 billion euros. Downward trend continues Moreover, the downturn of Greece's economy has accelerated with production and employment nose-diving, according to the national statistics office. The jobless rate currently stands at about 21 percent and industrial production slumped by 11 percent in December compared to the previous month. The eurozone and IWF bailout hinged on Greece boosting its tax revenue in January by around 9 percent compared to the same period last year. In reality, it dropped by seven percent and revenues from sales tax even plummeted by 19 percent - a clear sign of a deepening recession. Officially eurozone countries are adamant the second bailout won't exceed the 130 billion euros they dangled at the end of October in 2011. But it's likely this won't be enough. Several reports suggest that some in the European Central Bank (ECB) board are meanwhile prepared to reduce Greek debt by a further 13 billion euros. The ECB would only have to pass on its Greek bonds, which it bought at a discount, to the European crisis fund EFSF. Experts believe the ECB is holding Greek bonds to the tune of 50 billion euros. ECB to the rescue? That's why after the ECB board meeting on Thursday many journalists were asking ECB President Mario Draghi whether the bank is involved in rescheduling Greek debt, such as through the sale of Greek government bonds to the EFSF rescue fund. \"It depends - if you make a loss on the sales, that is monetary financing,\" Draghi replied. But that is something the ECB is not allowed to do. Conversely, however, Draghi's statement could be interpreted to mean that the ECB does not see the bond exchange with the EFSF as forbidden state monetary financing if it doesn't lose money doing so. Commerzbank chief economist J\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer considers this \"remarkable.\" Many media outlets reported that the ECB would sell its Greek bonds to the EFSF at 75 percent of their nominal value and receive EFSF bonds in return. A debt swap of this kind would mean that 25 percent less money would flow back to the ECB on maturity than if the Greek bonds were serviced completely. \"That means 25 percent more central bank money remains in circulation\", Kr\u00e4mer told Deutsche Welle. \"That really would be state monetary financing.\" But because the ECB could avoid pro forma book losses, \"the probability has increased significantly that in the end they will indeed be helping to reduce Greece's debt.\" Author: Rolf Wenkel / sb Editor: Andreas Illmer",

"story": "Christmas market in Germany begs visitors to stop coming Thousands of visitors caused chaos as they flocked to the idyllic forest market in Velen near the Dutch border, a village of only 75 people. Some 85 million people visit Germany's Christmas markets every year. A Christmas market in the German town of Velen has had to implore visitors to stop coming after a heavy influx of tourists descended on the tiny village near the Dutch border. \"As a result of the massive rush of visitors we must cancel this event!\" organizers from Velen's small hamlet of Landgut Krumme wrote on Facebook, \"the Christmas market in the forest remains a market for visitors from the area!\" The post asked that people from outside the region find another place to get their mulled wine and holiday handicrafts: \"Thank you for understanding.\" Tourists from all over Germany and neighboring countries, especially Belgium and the Netherlands, flock to the country's December markets to enjoy drinks, treats and the festive atmosphere. Looking at the pictures both on social media and those promoted by the tourism board of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where Velen lies, it is not difficult to see why people would converge on the community's Christmas market. Tucked inside an idyllic forest northwest of Dortmund, the market also boasted a \"living Nativity\" scene and locally-made delicacies. But this proved too popular for Landgut Krumme, which local newspaper Westdeutsche Allegemeine Zeitung wrote has only 75 inhabitants. On the first weekend of advent, thousands gathered in the hamlet, blocking the small streets for several kilometers in every direction. According to the K\u00f6lner Stadt-Anzeiger, a daily from Cologne \u2013 the site of Germany's most-visited Christmas markets \u2013 the number of foreign guests to the markets more than doubled over the past few years, and each year a total of about 85 million visitors make their way to the holiday staple. The tradition of Christmas markets in Germany-speaking countries dates back to the Middle Ages, with the oldest thought to have started in Vienna in 1298 and the most famous being Nuremberg's \"Christkindlmarkt.\"",

"story": "French government resigns in election formality In a post-election formality, French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has tendered his government's resignation. President Emmanuel Macron has reinstated him and is expected to name a new government on Wednesday. The French government resigned on Monday in a post-legislative-election formality. President Emmanuel Macron immediately reappointed Prime Minister Edouard Philippe and asked the right winger to form a new cabinet, Macron said in a statement. He was due to form a government on Wednesday. Macron's centrist En Marche! party won a decisive victory in a parliamentary election, allowing his government to quickly pass laws in the future. Government spokesman Christophe Castaner told RTL radio the government reshuffle would be \"technical and not far-reaching.\" Macron asked close ally Richard Ferrand, who is embroiled in a conflict of interest scandal, to leave his cabinet and seek the leadership of his party in parliament. His planned reshuffle was slightly delayed by an attempted attack on the Champs-Elysees on Monday afternoon. Security bills Following the attack Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said he would present a bill at cabinet meeting on Wednesday to extend France's state of emergency from July 15, its current expiration date, until November 1. Macron's government was expected to pass its first set of measures during a special parliamentary session starting on June 27. The laws were expected to include moves to strengthen security, improve ethics in politics and reform France's restrictive labor laws. En Marche! and its centrist ally MoDem won 350 seats in the 577-seat assembly. The conservative opposition, the Republicans, won a total of 130 seats with their allies. The Socialist Party of Macron's predecessor, Francois Hollande, lost more than 250 seats, obtaining just 30. Following the initial results, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said the voters had given a clear majority to President Macron, and that his government was \"humbled and determined\" after securing a victory in the polls. Philippe also said the diversity of new lawmakers was a good sign for France. \"This majority will have a mission: to work for France,\" the PM said. \"With their vote, the French have, by a wide majority, chosen hope over rage, optimism over pessimism, confidence over withdrawal.\" The newly-elected parliament is nearly six years younger on average than the previous, have a record 224 women lawmakers, and will be strikingly more varied in background. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was among the first to congratulate Macron. She lauded him for winning a \"clear parliamentary majority\" in elections Sunday, government spokesman Steffen Seibert said. Seibert added, in a tweet, that Merkel wished for \"further good cooperation for Germany, France, Europe.\" aw/tj (AFP, AP, Reuters, dpa)",

"story": "Le Pen 'copies phrases' from Fillon speech at May Day rally Marine Le Pen has repeated parts of a patriotic speech given by defeated conservative candidate Francois Fillon last month, French media report. The far-right presidential contender is being accused of plagiarism. French presidential hopeful Marine Le Pen did not say she was quoting Francois Fillon when she addressed her supporters at a May Day rally north of Paris. But French media reported Tuesday that, in her speech, she appeared to repeat almost verbatim three passages from an address the Les Republicains candidate delivered last month in Le Puy-en-Velay. The similarities were first picked up by satirical YouTube channel Ridicule TV, which is reportedly close to Fillon. The channel posted a video of the two candidates as they proclaimed the same statements. \"If there are waiting lists for the Alliance Francaise [French language and culture organization] in Shanghai, Tokyo, or Mexico, for the French secondary school in Rabat or Rome... that is because France is something else, much more than an industrial, agricultural or military power,\" Fillon argued on April 15. \"If there are waiting lists for the Alliance Francaise in Shanghai, Tokyo, or Mexico, for the French secondary school in Rabat or Rome... that is because France is something else, much more than the industrial, agricultural or military power that it must and can once more become,\" Le Pen said on May 1. Borrowed phrases Fillon referred specifically to the geography of France's borders and spoke of a third \"French way\" for the 21st century - sections Le Pen also borrowed, albeit with some adjustments to reflect her anti-EU political stance. \"Then, there is the frontier of the Rhine, the most open, the most dangerous, the most promising too - this Germanic world with which we have been so often in conflict and with which we will yet cooperate in so many ways,\" Fillon said. \"Then, there is the frontier of the Rhine, the most open, the most promising too - this Germanic world with which we will yet cooperate in so many ways, as long as we regain the status of allies and not of subjects or serfs,\" Le Pen declared. Read more: Le Pen's 'outsider' politics move to center stage in France Fillon, a former frontrunner who was eliminated in the first round of voting last month, also quoted World War I Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau and writer Andre Malraux. Le Pen used those same quotes in her speech, which comes ahead of Sunday's second round run-off. The similarities prompted \"Le Monde\" and other French media to accuse Le Pen of plagiarism. Deputy chairman of Le Pen's National Front party Florian Philippot defended the address, saying it contained a deliberate \"nod to a short passage in a speech about France\" on the part of \"a candidate that shows she is not sectarian.\" nm/se (AFP, dpa)",

"story": "Authorities probe Hungarian bus company over deadly Italy crash Hungary and Italy have begun probing a bus crash that killed 16 people. Survivors also thanked the heroic actions of a Hungarian gym teacher and his wife who tragically lost two of their own children in the crash. Criminal negligence charges may be levied against the owners of a bus that was involved in a fatal accident in Italy over the weekend, Hungarian police said on Sunday. Investigators raided the offices of Pizolitbusz Ltd in the southern Hungarian city of Kiskunfelegyhaza on Sunday looking for technical information on the bus. The crash near Verona left 16 members of a Hungarian school group, returning from a ski vacation, dead while two people are battling life threatening injuries. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto confirmed on Sunday that the bus carrying Hungarian students had 56 people on board, including two Hungarian drivers, when it crashed and burst into flames. He said it could take days to officially identify the victims due to severe burns. \"Two people are in critical condition and have not yet been identified. One of the injured has suffered third-degree burns on 60 percent of his body,\" Szijjarto said adding that another four people remained in serious condition. Heroic rescue Survivors of the bus crash told Italian media on Sunday that they were saved thanks to the actions of a gym teacher, his wife and a student. Gym teacher Gyorgy Vigh and his wife Erika dashed repeatedly into the blazing bus to get students but were unable to extract their own son and daughter, reported the \"Corriere della Sera\" newspaper. \"The teacher's wife was aboard and \"she saw her daughter die. She didn't see her son at all, but unfortunately he was among the deceased,\" confirmed Judit Timaffy, the Hungarian consulate in Milan, speaking to ANSA news agency. Survivors also spoke of a fellow student who saved numerous lives by running up and down the aisle of the bus, breaking windows with an emergency hammer. \"When he broke the one next to me I threw myself out. I don't know if I would have been able to get out if he hadn't been so brave. I never saw him again\" a student identified as Andras told the \"La Stampa\" newspaper. Police found the boy's body near the windows, still holding the hammer, highway police chief Girolamo Lacquaniti told local media. Malfunctioning wheel? A Slovenian truck driver who had been driving behind the bus told authorities that he noticed one of the vehicle's wheels appeared to be malfunctioning, a police official told news agency DPA. The owner of the bus company told the MTI news agency on Sunday that the bus was in good condition before the trip, adding that he could not explain the accident. rs/jm (AP, dpa, Reuters)",

"story": "Wife of Belgian serial killer and pedophile is freed A Belgian court decided to release the ex-wife and accomplice of the serial killer and pedophile Marc Dutroux. The decision relating to a crime that shocked the nation is likely to prove controversial. Two appeals against Michelle Martin's release were rejected by Belgium's highest court on Tuesday. Martin had served 16 years of a 30-year prison sentence for helping Dutroux, who kidnapped and raped six girls in the 1990s. Four of the girls, who were confined in a dungeonlike cellar, died. The court said 52-year-old Martin was free to leave prison immediately, backing the decision of a regional court to release her into a convent under strict parole terms. Belgian law dictates that, having served a third of her sentence, Martin can be set free if a rehabilitation program is in place. National debate sparked The regional ruling had provoked anger among victims' families, leading to demonstrations around the convent in the community of Malonne. It also triggered a debate bout the need to impose full-term jail sentences without parole for those crimes deemed the most serious. The appeals, one led by the father of a victim and another lodged by prosecutors, were judged to be inadmissible or unfounded. Martin, who had sought release on several previous occasions, claimed she was under Dutroux's spell and that she helped him reluctantly. Judges had approved a conditional release last year, but this was blocked when - in light of the public outcry at the time - a French convent went back on its offer of a place for Martin. rc/mkg (AFP, dpa)",

Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc told a news conference on Monday that Syrian troops had opened fire on a second aircraft, adding to a growing conflict over accusations that Syria shot down a Turkish fighter jet. Arinc did not specify when the incident occurred and whether the plane had been hit. He said it had been searching for the two missing pilots of the F4 Phantom jet, which he claimed was shot by a heat-seeking guided missile in international airspace on Friday. \"To target an aircraft in this fashion without any warning is a hostile act of the highest order,\" he said. \"Everyone must know that this sort of behavior will not go unpunished.\" Turkey further condemned Friday's incident in a letter to the UN Security Council on Monday, describing it as a \"hostile act by the Syrian authorities against Turkey's national security.\" It added that it had posed \"a serious threat to peace and security in the region\". At Turkey's request, NATO holding an emergency meeting on the incident in Brussels on Tuesday under Article 4 of its charter. It is only the second time in NATO's 63-year history that it has convened under Article 4, which can be invoked when a member state feels its territorial integrity, political independence or security is under threat. 'Act of defense' Turkey has said the fighter jet, which was on an unarmed training mission, was shot down a mile (1.6 kilometers) inside international airspace. It has said both Turkish pilots are still missing. Syria, meanwhile, has defended its actions as an act of defense, insisting the plane was inside Syrian airspace. \"The plane disappeared and then reappeared in Syrian airspace, flying at 100 meters altitude and about 1-2 kilometers (0.6-1.2 miles) from the Syrian coast,\" Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi told a news conference in Damascus. \"We had to react immediately, even if the plane was Syrian we would have shot it down,\" he said. \"The Syrian response was an act of defence of our sovereignty carried out by anti-aircraft machinegun which has a maximum range of 2.5 km.\" Military intervention Makdissi went on to warn both Turkey and NATO against taking retaliatory action. \"NATO is supposed to be there to strengthen countries,\" he said. \"If their meeting is for hostile reasons [they should know that] Syrian land and waters are sacred.\" By invoking Article 4 of the NATO charter it would appear that Turkey is not seeking armed invention. News agency AP reported on Monday, however, that Arinc had said Turkey planned to push NATO to consider the jet's downing under Article 5, which states that an attack against one NATO member should be considered an attack against all members. But Dutch Foreign Minister Uri Rosenthal said Monday that military intervention in Syria was \"out of the question.\" He called on Turkey to show restraint in its handling of the incident. ccp/pfd (AP, AFP, Reuters)",

"story": "US to deploy hundreds of Marines to Afghanistan The US will send 300 Marines to train Afghan forces in the embattled Helmand province, adding to nearly 10,000 US troops still in the country. The Taliban claimed most of the opium-making region after NATO withdrawal. The troops are set to be deployed in spring of 2017 as a part of NATO's advise-assist mission, the US Marine Corps announced on Friday. A 300-person force, led by a brigadier general, would \"train and advise key leaders\" within Afghanistan's security forces in the southern Helmand region. Both the Afghan army and the police are struggling to contain the Taliban insurgency, which took large swaths of territory by storm after NATO ended combat missions in 2014. The Taliban currently hold around 85 percent of the Helmand province and launch attacks on the remaining districts. The region is known for its massive opium trade. \"The Marine Corps has an operational history in Afghanistan, particularly in Helmand province,\" the officials said in the statement, adding that the Marines \"will assist in preserving gains made together with the Afghans.\" Opium output grows Although no foreign troops are currently fighting the Taliban, the United States still keeps nearly 10,000 troops in the war-torn nation under the so-called Resolute Support mission. While the Obama administration made plans to reduce this number in 2017, the fate of the mission is unclear as US President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office later this month. US officials believe that the Taliban cooperate with opium traffickers in the embattled province, with criminal networks aiding the insurgency. Last month, the chief US and NATO commander in Afghanistan, John Nicholson, stated that Kabul directly controls some 64 percent of the Afghan population, 4 percent less compared to his September estimate. The UN estimated that Afghanistan's opium production rose sharply during 2016. dj/sms (dpa, AFP)",

"story": "German welcome for Italian mafia sentences Until six people were shot dead at an Italian eatery in Duisburg in 2007, no one considered Germany mafia heartland. An Italian court has sentenced eight men, including the mastermind of that shooting, to life in prison. A court in Locri in Italy handed down eight life sentences to a group of gangsters from the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta mob. Among those it convicted was 32-year-old Giovanni Strangio, charged with masterminding six simultaneous shootings outside an Italian restaurant in Duisburg in western Germany. The city center attack took place within a stone's throw of the city's main rail station. \"I am happy that the excellent, meticulous work of investigators in Duisburg made this verdict possible,\" the interior minister for the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Ralf J\u00e4ger, said on Tuesday. \"This success is also thanks to the intensive cooperation between Italian and North Rhine-Westphalia police forces. It shows that international cooperation in the fight against organized crime is working.\" Strangio was arrested in Amsterdam in 2009, and investigators concluded that the six shootings in Duisburg were a revenge attack for a 2006 Christmas Day killing of his cousin Maria Strangio, allegedly carried out by members of the rival Pelle-Vottari crime family. These killings were all part of an ongoing feud between the two families, which is thought to have begun in 1991 when youths from the Nirta-Strangio clan started throwing eggs at members of the Pelle-Voltari family. About fourteen people have been killed since, with what the German press called \"the Duisburg massacre\" the most notorious single example. The 'Ndrangheta, based in Calabria - the \"toe\" of Italy - is not as well known as its Sicilian counterpart, the Cosa Nostra, or the Neapolitan Camorra, but authorities have repeatedly warned of the danger posed by their activities like drug trafficking and weapons smuggling.

Meanwhile, Chirac still faces corruption accusations. Chirac will officially inaugurate the foundation at a ceremony in Paris on Monday, June 9, together with supporters like former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and Nobel Peace Prize winner Mohammad Yunus. \"In the face of major world challenges, I still want to fight,\" said Chirac last week in an interview with the French daily Le Figaro -- his first public interview since leaving office last year. \"The foundation is the perfect tool for this. \"I want to stir and awaken consciences.\" Named after the 75-year-old former president, the foundation has begun half a dozen projects since it was legally established in March with a one-million euro ($1.57 million) endowment and a small staff. The endeavors focus on providing access to clean water and medicine, combating deforestation and preserving dying languages. Chirac is to announce the next set of projects on Monday. Under investigation The inauguration event marks a rare public appearance by the former head of state, who has been battling corruption allegations since losing his presidential immunity last year. He is under suspicion of embezzling city funds for political purposes during his time as mayor of Paris between 1977 and 1995. Last November, he was placed under formal investigation, a major step toward full criminal charges. Chirac denies the allegations.",

"story": "Neymar has millions in assets frozen in Brazil A Brazilian court has accused international football star Neymar of evading millions of dollars in taxes. Now the Barcelona Forward could face fines worth even more than that. The judge accused 23-year-old Neymar of tax evasion on Friday, freezing 188.8 million reals ($47 million, 42 million euros) of his assets. The Sao Paulo-born star forward, now with FC Barcelona in Spain, is suspected of evading taxes worth 63.6 million reals. Carlos Muta, the Brazilian judge who made the ruling, said he had frozen three times the amount Neymar has been accused of not paying in order to cover potential interest and fines, according to a document released by the court. The alleged evasion dates back to 2011-2013, before Neymar's move to last year's Champions League winners, when he starred for top-flight Brazilian club Santos. The player will still have access to his bank accounts and liquid assets, but will not be able to sell any of his assets before the case comes to a close. Because the fines amount to more than 30 percent of Neymar's total declared assets -- about 244 million real ($61 million, 54.5 million euros) -- Brazilian authorities also froze assets belonging to his family. Prosecutors allege that the player purposefully omitted sources of income from abroad, including FC Barcelona. This isn't the first time Neymar has been embroiled in a tax-related scandal. In 2014, Barcelona's Sandro Rosell resigned as president of the club following allegations that he had failed to report the full cost of Neymar's transfer to the Spanish club from Santos. Afterward, FC Barcelona paid Spanish tax authorities a total of 13.5 million euros. blc/msh (Reuters, AFP, dpa)",

"story": "The naked #selfie: how safe is a factory reset on your Android phone? Not very Antivirus and mobile security firm Avast! says it's unveiled major holes in Google's Android operating system after extracting masses of personal data from phones that had been factory restored. Avast! bought 20 secondhand Android phones on ebay. And, using commercially available forensic tools, they recovered data that should have been deleted when the previous user wiped the phone. The antivirus and mobile security firm based in the Czech Republic found thousands of emails, contact details, SMS text messages, selfies and other photos - some of a very intimate nature indeed. \"Most people don't think of their smartphone as a computer,\" says Avast!'s chief marketing officer, Chris Benham. \"But the problem is all of us are increasingly using our mobile devices as a replacement for our traditional computers,\" he says. \"We do online banking. We store family pictures. We store bank applications and other things that we would have used to have done on our computers, and which we're now doing on our devices.\" Erase all data? The problem, says Benham, is that on the secondhand phones Avast! bought, this data was still there, even though the user had selected \"factory reset\" which suggests everything would be erased. \"By having the option of erasing all the information, it creates the perception that you have deleted it and removed it because you can't visibly see it,\" Benham explains. \"But the reality is that all you've done is remove the pointers to the information. The information itself is still stored on the device.\" The phone overwrites your data in time as the new user adds their data - such as their photos and contacts. Your data meanwhile - as sensitive or embarrassing as it may be - could still be retrieved. Naked selfies \"We found about 40,000 photos, about 1,500 photos of children, thousands of Google searches, thousands of contact records, emails. So a lot of personal and private information,\" says Jude McColgan, president of the company's mobile division. Avast! says the photos included 750 images of women in various states of undress, and 250 photos of \"what appeared to be the previous owner's manhood.\" \"The risk to individuals - who think that they're otherwise deleting all of their personal information - is that if you give it to your mother, or you sell it, somebody really has quite an easy capability to go through digital forensics and get your stuff, get your personal information,\" McColgan says. Google criticism Google, which developed Android, was quick to criticize Avast!'s findings. The 20 phones tested, said the company, were running older versions of the Android mobile operating system. For the last three years, says Google, Android has featured an encryption tool that renders old data unrecoverable after a factory reset. However it's not a default setting, and presupposes considerable tech savvy on the part of the user. Avast! says it was puzzled by Google's response, as some of the phones were running fairly recent versions of Android. Some critics, however, described Avast!'s \"naked selfie expos\u00e9\" as little more than a PR stunt. The firm is trying to make the transition from a leading antivirus software company with more than 218 million users worldwide to a mobile security firm. Publicity stunt? \"I think it was a nice idea and they did a great job,\" says Jan Klesla, a journalist covering the IT business with the leading daily, \"Hospodarske noviny\". \"This factory wipe is something users rely on, and now they're trying to tell people that they should pay more for their mobile security. And this PR I think will help,\" says Klesla. Avast! offers a mobile security app - which is free - as well as a premium service offering additional benefits, for which you pay a fee. Some of these features are pretty nifty. Their anti-theft app, for instance, will snap a photo of the thief who tries to unlock your phone - and email it to you. Sledgehammer solution But as far as protecting your data is concerned, no solution is 100 percent effective. Apple users are definitely at an advantage as iOS, unlike Android, is not an open platform - everything is encrypted. But that doesn't make your wiped data unrecoverable if you lose, sell or pass on your phone. It is merely more difficult to extract. Experts like Jan Klesla advises users to save everything on a memory card - and take the card out when you sell your phone. And of course some will resort to the ultimate security solution - a slab of concrete and a sledgehammer.",

"story": "Tuaregs continue their advance in Mali Tuareg fighters have now captured three major cities in Northern Mali and now control almost the entire region. The country's military seem powerless to halt the advance of these nomadic fighters. Issa Dicko runs a writing course in the Malian capital of Bamako. He is a native of Timbuktu, the ancient city 800 kilometers (498 miles) northeast of the nation's capital. Following Gao and Kidal, Timbuktu is the latest major city to be captured by Tuareg forces, the MNLA. Dicko says his people are fighting for more autonomy. \"The Tuaregs used to control the whole Sahara and were organized in confederations, each with its own government. Every organization was politically and socially autonomous,\" he said. With this unique form of self-governance and their traditional nomadic lifestyle, the Tuaregs have struggled for generations under the influence of the state, and the demands placed on them. The low point was the forced settlement of Tuaregs which started shortly after Mali achieved independence in 1960. A history of uprisings Tuaregs first rose up against the state in 1990. Back then the MNLA rebels were powerless against a much better equipped national army. Yehia Ag Mohamed Ali is the national coordinator of a German government-run project to develop the region around Timbuktu. He can remember those times well. \"Back then a peace pact was agreed with the military, but no actual conditions were put in place. In 2006 there was a second revolt. And now we have a new rebellion, the likes of which we haven't seen before.\" One thing seems clear about this new conflict, though - the Tuareg army is much stronger than Mali's military forces. In fact, the March military coup came about for exactly this reason. The soldiers were angry at being sent to the north as cannon fodder and turned on the government. The military also have obsolete equipment and are poorly trained. That isn't the case with the MNLA troops. Yehia Ag Mohamed Ali is uncertain who is giving the Tuaregs their financial backing. \"Does the money come from drug dealing? Does it come from the Libyan government? That's also possible,\" he thinks. The Tuaregs and al Qaeda Some even think the MNLA's financing could come from al Qaeda. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) is certainly increasing its presence in the Sahara. The group is believed to have kidnapped a number of Europeans last November. Still, Issa Dicko doesn't believe that there is a link between the two organizations. Mainly because their goals are so different. \"What benefits does al Qaeda get from partnering up with the Tuareg?\" he asks. \"The Tuareg are a nomadic people with camels and goats. The Tuaregs have never fought a battle to convert others to Islam.\" The overthrow of the Malian government could ultimately help the Tuaregs. Ousted Malian president Amadou Toumani Toure didn't pay much attention to the fate of this minority group, which makes up about one tenth of the country's population of 14 million. With the coup leaders now in power, the Tuaregs may well have more chance of getting what they want. After all, the new regime in Bamako is no doubt keen to see an end to the conflict.

"story": "Dresden asylum camp cleared after neo-Nazi attack An asylum camp set up in front of Dresden's Semperoper opera house has been cleared. Refugees and supporters moved just a day after radical PEGIDA members and neo-Nazis attempted to storm the site. Local authorities had originally planned to clear the refugee camp, which had been set up on Saturday, by Monday evening. The administrative court of Dresden successfully filed an appeal, however, which appeared to fuel an attack on Monday night by radical members of PEGIDA and neo-Nazis. Following the usual rally held by the right-wing PEGIDA movement on Monday evening, some 100 radicals flocked to Dresden's Theaterplatz demanding for the asylum seekers' camp to be cleared. Others could be heard shouting \"Germany for Germans, foreigners out!\" and were reportedly seen throwing bottles and fire crackers in the direction of the camp. In what appeared to be a coordinated attack, about two dozen radicals attempted to storm the anti-PEGIDA rally from two directions. The counter protest was held by local refuges and supporters of the groups \"Asylum Movement,\" \"Dresden for All,\" and \"Dresden Nazi-free.\" Dresden police managed to fend off the PEGIDA members and neo-Nazis as they formed a chain of officers between the two protest groups, before later setting up a fixed cordon around Theaterplatz. Around 500 supporters of the refugees also gathered around the asylum camp to protect the tents. PEGIDA, which roughly translates as \"Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the West,\" has been holding demonstrations in Dresden and a host of other German cities since October. At its peak, the group saw a turnout of some 25,000 in Dresden. Figures have decreased in recent weeks, however, particularly after images of leader Lutz Bachmann posing as Adolf Hitler went viral. ksb/rg (AFP, dpa)",

"story": "Berlin graduates from bit part to leading role A quintessential \"Berlin film\" used to be a rarity, but is now common enough to merit a season of its own in one of the capital's movie theaters. The city also stars in a growing number of international productions. A new film program called \"Hauptrolle Berlin\" (Leading Role Berlin) launched this week in the capital\u2019s historic Zoopalast movie theater. It kicked off with 2012\u2019s sleeper hit \"Oh Boy\" and personal appearances by director Jan Ole Gerster and lead actor Tom Schilling. Judging by the full house, Berlin as seen through a camera lens is as popular as the real thing. As the travel sections and arts pages never tire of telling us, Berlin is having a moment. So is the \"Berlin film\": the Zoo Palast won\u2019t be hard-pressed to fill the season. \"The focus is on movies from the last 20 years,\" explains Jens Nitsche from Flebbe Services, the theater\u2019s operator. The plan is to give \"Hauptrolle Berlin\" a long-term slot, with upcoming featured films to include Tom Tykwer\u2019s \"Drei\" about an unusual love triangle, Hannes St\u00f6hr\u2019s\"Berlin Calling,\" an exploration of the infamous techno scene, and \"Hilde,\" the 2009 biopic about gravelly-voiced actress-chanteuse Hildegard Knef, an icon of post-war West Berlin. Distribution rights aside, another obvious pick would be the critically-acclaimed one-take romp \"Victoria,\" Sebastian Schipper\u2019s giddy odyssey through night-time Berlin that in June swept the board at the Lolas, Germany's equivalent of the Oscars. Meanwhile, runner-up \"Jack\" \u2013 which goes on release later this year - is an unsentimental social drama also set in Berlin, albeit a very different city from the one now enjoying global notoriety as the destination of choice for burnt-out bohemians fleeing the rat race. Berlin\u2019s currency as a city combining grit and glamor goes some way to explaining the glut of movies putting the city center-stage in recent years. It was arguably Tykwer\u2019s cult classic \"Run Lola Run\" that ushered in this new golden era of the \"Berlin film\" back in 1998 \u2013 after a dry period when one tended to come along only every decade or so. Think Fritz Lang\u2019s \"M\" in 1931; Robert Rossellini's \"Germany, Year Zero\" (1948), Billy Wilder\u2019s \"One, Two, Three\" (1961) and of course Wim Wenders\u2019 1987 homage to the divided city, \u201c\"Wings of Desire.\" Few others make the cut. Finding new angles It was inevitable that reunification would help rekindle the city\u2019s venerable tradition as a moviemaking capital, with the historic Babelsberg Studio privatized and reborn as Europe\u2019s largest film studio in the 1990s. Less predicable perhaps was that now, over 25 years later, Berlin is also enjoying burgeoning popularity as a location for international film productions. But while what they\u2019re after is the glamor, homegrown filmmakers are more interested in the grit. Even in the realm of cinema, it seems, a fight for the soul of Berlin is raging. For \"Oh Boy\" director Gerster, the challenge was to find an original way of committing this oh-so-popular city to the silver screen, now that its reputation precedes it. \"It tends to be portrayed as this place where everyone has cool jobs and listens to electro,\" he said at the opening of the \"Hauptrolle Berlin\" season. \"To me that\u2019s a distortion of reality. Berlin as a motif has become a little tired and it took me a long time to find the images I was after.\" His black and white take on the city is more lonely than lairy, with lingering shots of trams rumbling by, swaying cranes and cigarette smoke drifting in the air evoking an atmosphere of dislocation and disappointment that gives the lie to the usual hype about the hauptstadt. Berlin \u2013 the new Hollywood His Berlin is a far cry from the city that Carrie Mathison moved to for the fifth season of the US TV show \"Homeland,\" shot here on location this summer amid much local excitement, not to mention the highly contrived Berlin which the likes of Liam Neeson and Tom Cruise are seen striding through in big budget US movies such as \"Unknown Identity\" (2011) and \"Valkyrie\" (2008). Even Bollywood branched out to Berlin in 2011, with \"Don 2 \u2012The King is Back\" making cinema history as the first Bollywood film ever to be shot in Germany. While the majors have discovered the city\u2019s potential as a film set, they\u2019re taken less by its atmosphere and more by its imposing landmarks, whether the Adlon Hotel or the historic Bendlerblock. According to the Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg, a growing percentage of the 300-odd movies made in Berlin every year are now international productions. In 2013, for example, a record number of Hollywood movies were shot in Babelsberg, including \"The Monuments Men,\" \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" and \"The Book Thief.\" Once strictly the preserve of low-budget, independent filmmaking, Berlin last year alone saw Steven Spielberg shoot scenes for his new thriller \"Bridge of Spies\" on the Glienicke Bridge and the disused Tempelhof airport serve as a backdrop for action sequences in \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1.\" The crew of \"Captain America 3: Civil War\" is also expected to arrive later this summer. Ideal conditions \"Berlin-Brandenburg is increasingly in-demand as a location,\" confirms Dietrich Reupke from the film and media policy division at the Berlin Senate Office.\"This development has a substantial impact on regional revenue and also boosts Berlin\u2019s appeal as a media capital and tourism hub.\" The Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg, meanwhile, stresses that the city is now the most popular filming location in Germany, primarily due to funding opportunities, skilled teams, state-of-the-art techical production conditions and excellent price-performance ratios. It's home to more than 2,000 film companies with total revenues of more than \u20ac900 million and a growth rate of around 60 percent over the last 10 years. \"We're journeymen and we go where we have to go to make a movie,\" said the late Lloyd Phillips, producer on \"The International\u201d and \"Inglourious Basterds\" - two further costly movies using Berlin as a backdrop - in a 2009 interview with the New York Times. Right now, a blend of practical and artistic reasons are luring them to Berlin, and turning it into an increasingly significant hub of the industry. All that remains is for Woody Allen to make one of his picturesque European films in Berlin, rounding off his tour of Continental capitals from London to Rome and Paris. It probably wouldn\u2019t be recognizable as the city that steals the show in \u201cOh Boy\u201d \u2013 but it would be just as representative of today\u2019s all grown-up Berlin.",

"story": "Israel contemplates worst-case scenarios as Egypt's crisis deepens With Egypt's opposition movement gaining momentum and President Hosni Mubarak under increasing pressure, Israel is watching developments with concern as one its few Arab allies in the Middle East teeters on the brink. Egypt and Jordan are the only Arab countries that have signed peace deals with Israel, ensuring almost three decades of sometimes lukewarm detente between the countries, a period of time which has seen Israeli and Egyptian officials maintain low-profile consultations on many regional developments, including the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Egypt has been a key mediator in the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians; frequently hosting peace summits, brokering Palestinian reconciliation talks and mediating indirect discussions on possible prisoner swaps. All that could soon change, however. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week ordered his cabinet to refrain from commenting publicly on the popular uprising in Egypt but within the halls of power, it is well know that the Israeli administration is becoming increasingly nervous. A country which has acted as a counterweight to the majority view that Israel has no right to exist in the region could soon see Mubarak, one of the main architects of that balancing act for the last 30 years, removed from power. Who could take his place is a question that has Israeli military planners huddled over maps in darkened rooms. The common belief in the Jewish State is that popular sentiment in Egypt is anti-Israel and that the only people in Egypt who are committed to peace with Israel are those in President Mubarak's inner circle. Eli Shaked, a former Israeli ambassador to Cairo, wrote in the Yediot Aharonot newspaper recently that if the next president of Egypt is not from this inner circle then Israel is \"going to be in trouble.\" Israel fears growth of Egyptian Islamist support for Hamas One of the biggest concerns for Israel is the possible rise to power of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. Israelis who fear this scenario often refer to a 2008 Gallup poll which showed that 64 percent of Egyptians want Islamic law instituted in their country. Such a radical swing would almost certainly lead to a fracture in the Israel-Egypt peace accord. Any new Egyptian government which is unfriendly to Israel would present the Netanyahu administration with a series of potential flashpoints. In the case of an Islamist leadership taking over, Egypt's support for Hamas, the Gaza Strip's Islamic rulers, could increase, perhaps emboldening the militant group to launch a takeover of the Palestinian Authority-controlled West Bank. \"The main fear is that there will be a coalition government in Egypt headed by the Muslim Brotherhood,\" Yossi Mekelberg, an international relations lecturer at Regents College London and Middle East expert at Chatham House, told Deutsche Welle. \"Hamas is an offshoot of the Brotherhood so of course this will make things very difficult for Israel.\" Dr. Muriel Asseburg, head of the Middle East and Africa Research Division at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, believes that external policies and relations with Israel are not among the immediate objectives of any of the opposition groups in Egypt but shockwaves will still be felt outside the country should a new power take charge. \"Any interim government will struggle to reestablish stability, law and order and take measures that aim to alleviate social and economic grievances,\" she told Deutsche Welle. \"For none of the opposition forces, including the Muslim Brotherhood, relations with Israel will be a priority though.\u201d Mekelberg added that any coalition headed by the Muslim Brotherhood would change the climate in the region and fan what many experts are calling the flames of revolution. This could have dramatic implications for Gaza and the West Bank, he said. Analysts in the Jewish media have speculated that the Palestinians could take the opportunity afforded them by the rise of a sympathetic government in Egypt and the unrest in the region to advance their pursuit of a sovereign country without waiting for an accord with Israel. This, it is feared, could take the form of a new intifada. In addition to this possibility, an anti-Israel government in Egypt could threaten Israel's energy supplies - Egypt supplies around 40 percent of Israel's gas consumption - and could potentially oppose Israeli naval ships passing through the Suez Canal, where they have operated in a bid to prevent arms smuggling from Sudan to Gaza. Spreading pro-democracy unrest could upset old order There is also a concern that, should Mubarak's regime fall, the knock-on effect would also prompt an uprising in Jordan which has already seen a number of low-key pro-democracy protests. Jordanians are also angry about soaring food prices, escalating poverty and the unpopular policies of the government. Israel is concerned that if Jordan should fall - and if Islamist forces take power there also - it will find itself surrounded in a way it has not been in decades. \"Jordan is ripe for revolution,\" Mekelberg said. \"There is a majority of Palestinians there who are fervent supporters of Hamas while the legitimacy of the government and King Abdullah is limited.\" With Egypt and Jordan in unfriendly hands, and with former ally Turkey increasingly turning toward Iran and Syria, Netanyahu could find himself without an ally in the region and may find that he needs to step up the tentative efforts Israel has already made to reach a peace agreement with Damascus. Israel may be forced to forge alliances with old foes As the Middle East faces a violent shake-up of the old regional order, Israel may be forced to align itself with Syrian President Bashar Assad who shares a desire to maintain the current status quo. \"It's ironic that the rise of Islamist governments in Egypt and Jordan may force Israel to turn to Syria,\" Mekelberg said. \"The status quo in the Middle East is an illusion; the old order cannot be kept forever like the Israelis and the Syrians believe. The Israelis have been told that this could happen if they did not solve the Palestinian situation and other governments didn't deal with unemployment, poverty and corruption. These are the elements of which revolutions are made of.\" However, some analysts believe that even if a government less friendly to Israel takes power in Egypt, the new leadership would most likely want to maintain some kind of continuity in relations. \"Israel's concerns about a regime change are quite understandable,\" Asseburg said. \"Hosni Mubarak has defended Egyptian-Israeli peace and diplomatic relations ever since he has been in power.\" \"Still, even after the end of the Mubarak regime, we should not expect an end to peace with Israel or military threats towards Israel. What we should expect in the mid-term, though, is a further cooling of relations.\" Author: Nick Amies Editor: Rob Mudge",

"story": "EU wants states to return migrants to Greece The EU executive has recommended member states resume returning migrants to Greece next year. The aim is to restore the Dublin accord which fell apart due to Athens' money troubles and an influx of people seeking asylum. The new policy would only apply to newcomers leaving Greece after March 15, 2017, the European Commission, the EU executive, said on Thursday. According to their recommendation, the change would not affect unaccompanied minors and vulnerable groups of migrants. Italy and Greece are by far the main entry points for migrants from outside the EU. Under the Dublin accord, countries are obligated to process asylum requests for all who enter the EU through their territory. If the asylum seeker later leaves the \"country of first entry\" and travels to other EU states, the first country is obligated to take them back. However, Greece was made exempt from this rule in 2011, when a court decided that conditions for migrants were \"degrading\" in the debt-ridden country. The Dublin accords were also deeply undermined by the unprecedented arrival of about a million people seeking refuge in 2015. Overwhelmed by the influx, Greek authorities started waving the migrants through their territory and toward richer EU countries like Germany and Sweden, which were also the destinations of choice for the migrants. This eventually led the countries north of Greece to close their borders and put the passport-free travel policy of the Schengen zone at risk. EU commissioner praises Greece With the EU-Turkey deal slowing the flow of migrants to Greece, Brussels is seeking a way to resume its former policy. \"We are recommending the gradual resumption of Dublin transfers of asylum seekers starting next year,\" EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos told a press conference on Thursday. Greece would also need to provide guarantees that every individual migrant would receive proper treatment, EU officials said. Avramopoulos, who once served as Greek defense minister, said he wanted to praise Athens' progress \"under very pressing, very difficult conditions to put in place a fully functioning asylum system\" in recent months. Amnesty slams Brussels The European Commission also called on other countries to step up their involvement with the troubled relocation scheme, that aimed to resettle 160,000 people from Italy and Greece to other EU countries. Various members of the bloc refused to take part altogether. Commenting on the Thursday's recommendation, Amnesty International's Iverna McGowan said it was \"outrageously hypocritical\" of the commission to \"insinuate that Greece alone is to blame\" for the bad conditions in which migrants live. The troubles are caused by the EU-Turkey deal and the \"lack of solidarity from other EU countries to relocate people,\" she said. dj/se (AFP, Reuters, dpa)",

"story": "Opinion: Transatlantic Rapprochement March 11, 2004 was a day of shock and horror for Spain and Europe. The al Qaeda bomb attacks which killed 192 showed that Europe was a target like the US. What has happened regarding the fight against terror since then? No doubt about it, even the sharpest critics of US President George W. Bush had to realize on March 11 of last year that the al Qaeda terror network isn't just a threat to the United States, but to Europe's democracies as well. Indeed, it is important and even necessary to denounce the military invasion in Iraq, which had no basis in international law, or human rights violations such as those we see in Guantanamo. But some voices have gone much further, and they are especially vociferous in Europe. They consider Bush's challenge to the terrorists as only a pretext to cement the global supremacy of the United States and to secure it future sources of oil. The bloody attacks in Madrid, however, set many such twisted views straight. That is because the danger that Osama Bin Laden represents is real. His terror cells are not only in Europe, preparing -- as they did before Sept. 11, 2001 -- to carry out attacks in the US. They have also long had targets in Europe in their sights. Madrid is not the first case. Even before the catastrophes in New York and Washington, an al Qaeda bomb attack on a Christmas market in Strasbourg was narrowly prevented. Those who criticize Bush's method of fighting international terrorism should have another, better concept on hand to act against al Qaeda and similar terrorist organizations. However, the Europeans have had difficulties in this regard. While EU member states did decide shortly after Sept. 11, 2001 that they wanted to cooperate more closely and effectively, today their efforts have borne little fruit. The EUROPOL police organization, the Europe-wide legal authority EUROJUST and the much ballyhooed cooperation of various secret service agencies work much better in theory than in practice, largely due to stonewalling on the national level. Even the appointment of a special anti-terror commissioner -- a direct reaction to the Madrid attacks -- has changed very little on the ground. Projects like the European arrest warrant, which enjoyed some early enthusiasm, have since lost much of their vim and vigor. Change has taken place Still, the EU has changed since March 11, 2004. On the one hand, the once frequent calls against a strong European Union have been nearly silenced, since people have realized that it is only a Europe working together that can counter the threat of international terrorism. On the other hand, the deep fractures that broke open between those against the Iraq war and those favoring the US position have finally healed. That is quite remarkable really, since Spain's Bush-friendly president, Jose Maria Aznar, was voted out of office shortly after the March 11 attacks, punished by the electorate for using all his resources to place the blame for the bloodbath on Basque separatists. His successor, Jose Luis Zapatero, then made his first official act the removal of Spanish soldiers from Iraq, thereby putting him squarely in the anti-war camp along with Germany and France. A few months later, Poland made its own exit from the \"coalition of the willing.\" But all of that still didn't deepen the differences of opinion on either side of the Atlantic. On the contrary, both sides have come closer together. Despite its critique of the Bush administration, Germany has, for example, decided to step up its training programs for Iraqi security forces. The recognition that an instable Iraq provides fertile ground for terror organizations like al Qaeda is not new. But it did gain new prominence after March 11, 2004. And that's a good thing.",

"story": "EU adopts broad economic sanctions against Russia The EU has for the first time adopted new sanctions against Russian oil companies, banks and defense firms over the Kremlin's support of separatist violence in Ukraine. Similar measures from the US could soon follow. European Union governments imposed broad economic sanctions against Russia on Tuesday, intending to strongarm Moscow into reducing its role in the conflict in Ukraine. Aimed at Russia's energy, finance and defense sectors, the new measures will include an arms embargo, a ban on exports of some sensitive technologies and a ban on the sale of bonds and equities by state-owned Russian banks in European capital markets, diplomats in Brussels told reporters. The sanctions, designed to make Moscow's support of pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine uneconomical, are expected to come into force onThursday. Shortly after the EU's announcement, US Secretary of State John Kerry said Washington was also drawing up its own round of fresh sanctions against Russia. A White House spokesman said the US' response could be unveiled later in the day on Tuesday. \"We have made it clear that additional sanctions and additional costs could be imposed on Russia,\" spokesman Josh Earnest said. A 'strong warning' After months of hesitation, the EU finally issued what the body's president, Herman Van Rompuy, hoped was a \"strong warning\" that would make Russia reconsider its current course. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the decision to impose sanctions was \"inevitable\" after European leaders repeatedly made clear to Moscow that its annexation of Crimea and financial and material support to Ukrainian separatists were unacceptable. \"It is now up to the leadership in Russia to decide whether they want to go the way of de-escalation and cooperation,\" Merkel said in a brief statement. \"The EU sanctions can be reviewed but further steps are also possible.\" Businesses take a tougher stance While the measures approved go beyond the EU-wide asset freezes and visa bans the bloc had imposed until now on confidants of Russian President Vladimir Putin, European diplomats noted that eight more names had also been added to that list. Those earlier measures had also targeted companies and other entities believed to have either facilitated or profited from the fighting in Ukraine. Many EU countries have close economic ties with Russia, a reality that had made Brussels reluctant to come down too heavily on Moscow. However, the alleged downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 by pro-Russian rebels using a Russian-made surface-to-air missile persuaded major business lobbies, notably in Germany, to come out in favor of tougher economic sanctions. That support made it more politically feasible to push harsher sanctions to the top of the EU agenda. Putin's last chance Speaking to reporters after meeting with Ukraine's new foreign minister, Pavlo Klimkin, Kerry said he had raised the issue of Moscow's role in the Ukrainian conflict in a Tuesday phone call with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. \"The Russians and their so-called volunteers are continuing to ship arms and funds and personnel across the border,\" he said. \"We see this. There is clear evidence of it.\" He was referring to satellite imagery released over the weekend of Russian artillery firing into Ukraine from across the border. Such images, as well as reports that international investigators are being prevented from accessing the site where the Malaysian airliner went down more than a week ago, have driven Western relations with Russia to their lowest point since the Cold War. The United States has indicated that there has been \"no shred of evidence\" that Russia is willing to lend the international community a hand in ending separatist violence in Ukraine, but Kerry did suggest that Putin still had the chance to reverse course and avoid a new round of punitive action from Washington. cjc/kms (AFP, Reuters, AP)",

"story": "German students protest university reforms Students throughout Germany are protesting reforms to the country's university system. But Germany's education minister says the changes will go ahead as planned - preferably sooner rather than later. German university students staged demonstrations across the country on Thursday to protest recent reforms to the country's degree system and tuition fees. They also complain that colleges are underfunded and understaffed. By 2010, Germany will follow the Bachelor-Master-Doctorate format as part of the Council of Europe's Bologna reforms, aimed at synchronizing Europe's higher education standards. But critics say the new system will be too intense, as the time to complete one's degree will be shorter. \"The students are protesting against the workload that results from this more condensed course and fear that a bachelor's degree will not be enough when entering the job market,\" said Susanne Schilden, a spokeswoman for the German Rectors Conference, a group representing 265 of the country's 300 universities. Demonstrators, who occupied lecture halls in 20 German cities, including Berlin, Hamburg and Munich, also said they want tuition fees to be scrapped. Police evicted around 200 protesters from a university lecture hall in Tuebingen. Inspiration from Austria Since 2005, German universities have been allowed to charge tuition fees, which now run between 100 to 500 euros ($150 to $750) per semester. \"No one can force an academic reform against the will of the students,\" a statement from the Munich students said. \"Therefore we call for rights of co-determination for all decision-making processes that affect studies at the university.\" Education Minister Annette Schavan has called for Germany's 16 states to quickly implement the planned reforms. \"The students need a clear signal that the corrections that have been decided are being incorporated into the academic system,\" Schavan told broadcaster Suedwestrundfunk. The demonstrations began on Wednesday. They were inspired by student protests in Austria that have been underway for the past three weeks. There, too, the students are protesting against the Bologna reforms as well as plans to introduce tuition fees and to limit admissions to certain courses of study. vj/AFP/dpa Editor: Nancy Isenson",

"story": "US Soldier sentenced to jail for murdering Afghans The first of five US soldiers charged with killing unarmed Afghan civilians has been sentenced to 24 years in prison. During the trial he pleaded guilty to murdering three villagers using illegally obtained weapons. Corporal Jeremy Morlock admits to murdering and helping to kill three Afghan men in Kandahar province in 2010. To make the victims look like enemy combatants, Morlock said he and his four co-accused staged the slayings with grenade blasts and rifle fire. \"I knew what I was doing was wrong, Sir,\" Morlock said at the trial, adding that his judgment hat not been impaired by drugs, though the 23-year old soldier admitted to having smoked hashish three or four times a week during his deployment in Afghanistan. Under the plea deal, which calls for a maximum sentence of 24 years, Morlock managed to avoid life imprisonment. His lawyer Frank Spinner says he will be eligible for parole in seven years. Morlock, who showed no emotion when given the sentence, will be dishonorably discharged from the Army. \"The plan was to kill people\" Morlock is the first soldier to face a court-martial out of five members of the infantry unit\u2019s so-called \"kill team.\" Apart from the charges of the attempted murder of Afghan civilians, prosecutors have also charged the soldiers with dismembering the victims and collecting body parts from dead Afghans. Staff Sergeant Calvin Gibbs has been fingered by Morlock as the ringleader. Gibbs is said to have shown the men a stash of weapons he had illegally obtained in Afghanistan and led them in creating a plot to murder Afghan civilians in 2009. Without hesitation Morlock answered, \"the plan was to kill people,\" when asked if they were shooting to kill or to scare the civilians. Morlock has agreed to testify against his co-accused if called as a prosecution witness for their court-martial. At Gibbs' pre-trial hearing in November 2010, defense attorney Phillip Stackhouse had argued that his client had played no role in the killings and painted Morlock as a drug-addicted, mentally unstable, and fundamentally unreliable witness. The most serious prosecution The court-martial has taken place a few days after the German weekly, \"Der Spiegel,\" published several photos related to the killings. In them, Morlock poses with the corpses. They are said to be among dozens seized by investigators and sealed from public view by the army. The guilty plea and sentencing of Morlock marks a turning point in the most serious prosecution of alleged US military atrocities during the US\u201910 years of war in Afghanistan. The US Army had recently completed a top-to-bottom review of Morlock\u2019s combat unit, the 5th Stryker Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, in conjunction with the criminal investigation. The 500-page report was, however, not used as evidence in Morlock\u2019s case. Author: Anggatira Gollmer (Reuters, Afp, ap) Editor: Sarah Berning",

"story": "Archaeologist Lutz: \u2018We really weren\u2019t expecting this tremendous discovery\u2019 The great ape teeth found in Eppelsheim last year could topple the understanding of our earliest history. Herbert Lutz, head of the excavation team, tells DW what the find means to him - and how it almost didn\u2019t happen.  A little over a year ago, a team of archaeologists in southwestern Germany uncovered two teeth where the Rhine River used to flow, in the town of Eppelsheim near Mainz. The news of the discovery was announced officially this week, because the team that performed the excavation wanted to make sure that what they had found was as significant as they initially thought. Herbert Lutz heads that team at the Natural History Museum in Mainz. Herbert Lutz: It's completely new to science, and it is a big surprise because nobody had expected such a tremendous, extremely rare discovery. To find a completely new species? Nobody expected that. DW: Why were you looking at this precise location? We were excavating riverbed sediments of the proto-Rhine River near Eppelsheim. These sediments are approximately 10 million years old and are well known in science, ever since the first fossils were excavated here in the early 19th century. And how old are the teeth you've found? Around 9.7 million years old. What does a 9.7-million-year-old tooth look like? It's perfectly preserved. It actually looks like a new excellent tooth; however, it's no longer white. It's shining like amber. No less has been said about this tooth than that the history of mankind now has to be rewritten\u2026 Well you know it's a question that's been discussed for decades. New discoveries lead to new insights that may contribute to our knowledge about our own history, and this finding has that potential because the great ape species has a relationship to Homo sapiens. Read more: Neanderthals dined on woolly rhinos and used aspirin So what's the big groundbreaking knowledge here? The groundbreaking knowledge is that we have comparable finds only in East Africa. And these are much, much younger. These species are well known as Ardi and Lucy, and their canines look very similar to the one here from Eppelsheim, but they are only two, three, four or five million years old, and Eppelsheim is almost 10. So the question is: What has happened? You mean - how this great ape got up to the Rhine valley, or whether the species in Africa came from Europe? Yeah, we have similar species in Africa, but we don't know where this great ape came from. We do not have comparable finds from southern Europe, even from in between maybe Greece or Turkey. From there, we know of great ape fossils, but they all look much different. And so it's a great mystery. So this is the lone Rhineland monkey whose teeth have been found. Can the general public see the discovery? Until Sunday, yes, they are in our exhibition in the museum in Mainz. And most likely about mid November they will be on display in a great exhibition in the Landesmuseum in Mainz. Professor Lutz, can you give us a sense of how important this finding was to you personally? Well, we've been digging at this site for 17 years now. And when we started, of course everybody knew it had the potential to yield hominoid fossils. We were always waiting for such a find. But at the end of 2016, we decided to finish the excavation and just in the last second, if you will, these two teeth came to light. We really weren't expecting such a tremendous discovery. So for us now it's clear we have to continue, and we will continue. And, well, I think it's a big luck to experience such an exciting story. I did not expect it. Professor Herbert Lutz is deputy director of the Natural History Museum in Mainz. His focus is geological and paleontological excavation.",

"story": "Jailed mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano dies in prison, aged 83 Sicilian mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano has died after a long illness. He was considered to be Cosa Nostra's \"boss of bosses\" for years, prior to his 2006 arrest in Corleone. The notorious mafia boss died in prison at the age of 83, the Italian news agency ANSA reported. \"Cosa Nostra\" boss Provenzano had been suffering from Parkinson's disease. He died at the San Paolo hospital in Milan, where he was being treated for bladder cancer. Bernardo Provenzano, 83, was arrested in 2006 in Sicily after spending 43 years on the run. At the time of his arrest he was considered to be one of Italy's most wanted criminals and was given several life sentences in prison. Provenzano, dubbed \"the bulldozer\" or \"the tractor\" for the manner in which he flattened opponents and rivals, was found responsible for multiple murders over the years. Bomb attacks ordered by the mafia boss resulted in the deaths of two top anti-mafia prosecutors in 1992, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. Provenzano was presumed to be the \"capo dei capi\" or the \"boss of bosses\" of the criminal organization, which he reportedly led until his arrest in 2006. A life on the run Provenzano was born in the Sicilian village of Corleone - which later became famed for being associated with the Sicilian mafia in the \"Godfather\" movie trilogy. He reportedly committed his first murder aged 25, when he killed a rival boss. Provenzano's criminal career saw him second-in-command to mafia leader \"Toto\" Riina, who presided over a series of killings of top judges that became a hallmark of Italian life in the 1980s. He became the uncontested head of \"Cosa Nostra\" after Riina was arrested in 1993. The Agence France Press news agency reported that Provenzano is thought to have been involved in arranging Riina's arrest. Under Provenzano's leadership in the 1990s, the group focused on infiltrating Italy's police force as well as getting involved in public works contracts in Sicily, gradually turning the mob into a white-collar industry of illegal activity, and this weakening its dependence on crimes like drug trafficking. The bounty on Provenzano's arrest was said to be some three billion lira at that time, or around 1.5 million euros ($1.65 million). By 2003, the price on his head had risen to 2.5 million euros. Sudden arrest and incarceration Provenzano was finally arrested in a farmhouse in his native village of Corleone near the Sicilian capital Palermo in 2006 after the police received information saying he had undergone an operation for prostate cancer in Marseille, France. A picture from a false ID document helped in leading the police to his hide-out. Provenzano had already been convicted in absentia of more than a dozen murders, including those of Sicily's top two anti-Mafia investigators, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. He was also convicted for a series of bombings which took place in 1993 in Rome, Milan and Florence, including one attack near the Uffizi art gallery. His lawyer Rosalba Di Gregorio cited Provenzano's increasing physical frailty and mental health in several failed attempts to ease the prison his conditions, especially after a failed suicide attempt in 2012. In one of the last pictures taken before his death, Provenzano's ill health was visible. However, Provenzano spent the last decade of his life under condition akin to solitary confinement in a bid to curb his influence from behind bars. Following his death, social media users started sharing the names of some of his victims. ss/msh (AFP, AP, dpa)",

"story": "Leaders head to Paris for Syria talks Leaders have headed to Paris for fresh Syria due to kick off tomorrow. But China and Russia look set to snub the event, as the bloodshed on the ground continues. Foreign ministers headed to Paris on Thursday ahead of a Friday meeting on how to resolve the Syria conflict, although the talks look set to be boycotted by Russia and China. The Friends of Syria meeting, due to kick off on Friday, is being attended by the United States, Germany, Britain, France, and Arab nations including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, among other countries. Talks will focus on strategies for ending the violence in Syria. It follows similar talks in Tunis in February and in Istanbul in April. Leaders from Moscow do not look set to attend the event, however, as rumors circulated in the Russian press that the United States was seeking to persuade Russia to host an exiled Assad. Hosting Assad idea 'a joke' But the idea of Russia hosting Assad, which was first raised by German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a meeting in June, was dismissed as a joke by Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday. \u201cOur side thought this was a joke and responded with a joke - how about you, the Germans, take Mr Assad instead,\u201d Lavrov said in Moscow during a joint press conference after a meeting with his German counterpart Guido Westerwelle. Nor does Beijing seem likely to attend the Friends of Syria meeting. The foreign ministry spokesman Liu Weimin told reporters that his country \u201cat present does not consider attending the meeting.\u201d Bloodshed in Syria On the ground in Syria, at least 27 people were killed on Thursday, according to the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights, a day after violent convulsions swept through the country, reportedly killing 99 people. The figures emerged on the same day that Syrian troops advanced into Khan Sheikhoun, a rebel-held town in the country's north, killing at least 11 people according to activists. And in an attempt to add his own voice to continued political discourse on the Syria situation and remind the world of his ability to hang on to power, President Assad also spoke out on Thursday, about the rebellion and his political survival so far. \u201cThe big game targeting Syria is much bigger than we expected,\u201d he said in an interview with Turkey's Cumhuriyet newspaper. \u201cThe fight against terrorism will continue decisively in the face of this.\u201d sej/msh (AFP, Reuters)",

"story": "French President Emmanuel Macron signs controversial anti-terror law The new law gives French police permanent powers to shutter places of worship and conduct on-the-spot identity checks. Critics have decried the measure for its restriction of civil liberties and for targeting minorities. French President Emmanuel Macron signed a controversial raft of anti-terror legislation into law on Monday, ending the two-year state of emergency enacted after the November 2015 terror attacks in Paris that killed 130 people. The new measures give security services permanent authority to shut places of worship deemed to be fostering extremism, confine the movements of terrorism suspects and search their homes without necessarily seeking the approval of a court first. Police are also allowed to demand identity documents from anyone they deem suspicious at border areas, ports, train stations and airports. \"This law will allow us to end the state of emergency from November 1 while fully ensuring the security of our citizens,\" Macron said as he signed the document, which was approved by a parliamentary majority earlier this month. Debate over basic freedoms The bill sparked considerable debate over the past two weeks in French parliament, with critics arguing that it will be used to persecute minorities, particularly Muslims, with impunity. Macron has promised that the law will be reassessed in two years for its effectiveness. According to a poll by Le Figaro newspaper, 57 percent of the French public backs the measures, although 62 percent agreed that it was a restriction of basic freedoms. Interior Minister Gerard Collomb defended the laws, saying that \"everyone noticed we needed a fair balance between security and freedom, and I believe this text meets this need.\" Under the state of emergency, 11 religious centers have been shuttered \"for incitement to commit terrorist acts\" and 41 individuals have been placed under house arrest for harboring extremist sympathies. es/jm (AP, AFP)",

"story": "UK spy chief warns of terrorist threat, seeks more surveillance powers In the first ever live interview by the chief of a UK spy agency, MI5 head Andrew Parker has appealed for more surveillance powers. He said Britain's security forces had thwarted six plots in the past year. The head of the UK's domestic intelligence agency is pushing for expanded government surveillance powers to respond to a rising homegrown terrorism threat. MI5 Director General Andrew Parker said in an interview with BBC Radio 4 on Thursday that terrorists were increasingly using advanced technology and social media to plan attacks and spread propaganda for the self-styled \"Islamic State\" (IS). \"They are using secure apps and Internet communication to try to broadcast their message and incite and direct terrorism amongst people who live here who are prepared to listen,\" Parker told the \"Today Programme.\" The British government estimates that at least 700 of its citizens have joined IS in Syria and Iraq, prompting the government last year to raise its security threat level to \"severe.\" The designation, the second highest, means authorities consider a terrorist attack to be highly likely. Parker said the terrorist threat was \"continuing to grow largely because of the situation in Syria and how that affects our security.\" However, the record number of refugees fleeing conflict for Europe is not \"the main focus of where the threat is coming from,\" Parker said. The spy chief said security services had thwarted six terrorist plots in the past 12 months, while last week British police carried out a record number of arrests on suspected terrorists. British Prime Minister David Cameron's government plans to introduce new laws to strengthen police and intelligence agencies' surveillance powers, but the measures face stiff opposition from human rights and privacy groups - and quite probably from new opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. Opposition to government surveillance has mounted following revelations from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden showing the US and British governments cooperated in conducting mass surveillance. Parker, however, brushed aside fears the government would conduct mass surveillance against ordinary citizens. \"We're focused on the people who mean us harm,\" he said.\"We're not about browsing through the private lives of the citizens of this country. We do not have population-scale monitoring or anything like that.\" cw/msh (AP, Reuters)",

"story": "Britain's Prince Harry scores radio interview with former US President Obama In his first interview since leaving office in January, Obama said he felt liberated despite missing the work of being president. He also warned about the perils of social media. In a BBC interview broadcast on Wednesday, former US President Barack Obama told Britain's Prince Harry that he was at peace and felt liberated on the day he left the White House in January, despite the enormous amount of work left undone. The prospect of getting up in the morning and setting his own agenda for the day was \"hugely liberating,\" Obama said, and explained that included having time to talk to his wife, Michelle. \"I miss the work itself because it was fascinating,\" Obama said of his eight years in the White House, and he cited his health care reform, popularly known as Obamacare, as one of his proudest achievements. Dangers of social media Obama spoke with Harry in the prince's capacity as a guest interviewer for the BBC Radio 4 news program. The interview was conducted in Canada in September, and both men said it was Obama's first since leaving the Oval Office. The two also spoke about social media. Without naming his successor, Donald Trump, the former president said people in government should be careful how they used social media. And he cited the need to promote diverse views in a way that \"doesn't lead to a Balkanization of our society.\" \"All of us in leadership have to find ways in which we can recreate a common space on the internet,\" Obama said. \"One of the dangers of the internet is that people can have entirely different realities; they can be just cocooned in information that reinforces their current biases.\" Fear of angering Trump In the past, Obama has already lamented how social media platforms compel people to make snap judgments about complex issues \u2014 again, without criticizing Trump's regular use of Twitter. In his interview with Prince Harry, Obama said moving online communities offline would help people see the complexity of public policy issues and added that it would make criticism more difficult. \"It's also, by the way, harder to be as obnoxious and cruel in person as people can be anonymously on the internet,\" he said. As a guest editor Harry has focused on climate change, the military and mental health. In a brief live segment at the end of the show, he prince was asked by the BBC whether the Obamas would be invited to his wedding with US actress Meghan Markle next year. \"I don't know about that,\" Harry said. \"We haven't put the invites or the guest list together. Who knows whether they are going to be invited or not. I wouldn't want to ruin that surprise.\" The tabloid newspaper Sun reported Tuesday that British government officials had urged the prince not to invite the Obamas to his wedding for fear of angering Trump. bik/tj (AP, Reuters)",

"story": "Republican Senate candidate Moore faces underage sex allegations Republican candidate for Attorney General Sessions' seat in the US Senate, Roy Moore, faces allegations of sexual contact with minors decades ago. A month to go before the special election, his race may already be run. The Washington Post reported on Thursday that Alabama woman Leigh Corfman said the now 70-year-old Moore, then a 32-year-old assistant district attorney, had had sexual contact with her when she was 14. Moore has denied the accusations against him, calling them politically motivated. The Alabama special election on December 12 is to fill the vacancy created when Trump picked Senator Jeff Sessions to serve as attorney general. The Republicans have a majority of only two in the Senate as President Donald Trump embarks on a key piece of legislation on tax reform. Since news broke of film producer Harvey Weinstein's alleged sexual misconduct over the last few weeks, many allegations have been made against public figures and celebrities. In the primary contest between Luther Strange and Moore in September much of the Republican establishment \u2014 including President Donald Trump and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell \u2014 backed Strange. The GOP's more conservative wings, including former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, backed Moore. Moore won despite being outspent by a margin of 10-to-1 by Strange. Moore will run against Democrat Doug Jones on December 12. In a short campaign statement, Jones said, \"Moore need to answer these serious charges.\" The allegations The Washington Post reported that Moore first approached then 14-year-old Corfman in early 1979 outside a courtroom in Etowah county and after phone calls and meetings, he drove her to his home and kissed her, Corfman told the paper. Alabama law lists the legal age of consent as 16. Three other women also interviewed by the paper said Moore had approached them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18 and he was in his early 30s. Two of the women spoke of Moore giving them glasses of wine when they were under the legal drinking age of 19. The state's statute of limitations for bringing felony charges involving sexual abuse of a minor in 1979 would have run out three years later and Corfman never filed a police report or a civil suit. 'Fake news'? Moore's campaign denied the report and said it was \"the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation.\" \"After over 40 years of public service (by Moore), if any of these allegations were true, they would have been made public long before now,\" the Moore campaign said in an email to supporters. Moore also issued a fundraising appeal asking for emergency donations in a \"spiritual battle.\" \"I believe you and I have a duty to stand up and fight back against the forces of evil waging an all-out war on our conservative values,\" he wrote. \"I will NEVER GIVE UP the fight!\" Moore or less gone? Senior Republicans have called on Moore to step aside from the Senate race if the allegations are shown to be true. \"The allegations against Moore are deeply troubling,\" said Colorado Senator Cory Gardner, who leads the Senate GOP campaign arm. \"If these allegations are found to be true, Roy Moore must drop out of the Alabama special Senate election.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell added, \"If these allegations are true, he must step aside.\" Arizona Senator John McCain said, \"He should immediately step aside and allow the people of Alabama to elect a candidate they can be proud of.\" There were, however, some Republicans willing to see Moore see out the rest of the race \u2014 and the allegations against him. \"Take Joseph and Mary. Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter. They became parents of Jesus,\" Alabama state Auditor Jim Ziegler told The Washington Examiner. Strange days indeed Strange has reportedly left open the possibility he may re-enter the campaign. Moore's name cannot be removed from the ballot before the special election even if he withdraws from the race, according to John Bennett, a spokesman for the Alabama secretary of state. Moore made his name in the Republican party through his devotion to hardline Christian conservative positions. He was twice removed from his Supreme Court position, once for disobeying a federal court order to remove a 5,200-pound (2,360-kilogram) granite Ten Commandments monument from the lobby of the state judicial building. jbh/sms (AP, AFP)",

"story": "UNESCO World Heritage, an award that commits 42 World Heritage Sites in Germany invite you to guided tours and events on UNESCO World Heritage Day on 3 June. Soon there could be two new UNESCO sites. Forty years ago, Aachen Cathedral was named Germany's first World Heritage Site. This year's World Heritage Day will open with a festive service in the thousand-year-old Church of the Holy Sepulchre of Charlemagne, the German Emperor. The Zollverein colliery, the city of Regensburg, the Garden Kingdom of Dessau-W\u00f6rlitz and the Bauhaus in Weimar - they all belong to the heritage of mankind and offer snapshots from a history spanning more than 6,000 years. The first pile dwellings on Lake Constance were built as early as the Stone Age. The Romans left their traces in Trier and at the Limes borders. The memory of the reformer Martin Luther lives on in Wittenberg. Weimar, the place of work of Goethe and Schiller, exudes the spirit of German Classicism. The Margravial Opera House in Bayreuth, which only reopened in April after five years of renovation, is hosting a festive concert to mark World Heritage Day. Monasteries, castles, museums and gardens invite you to discover the cultural diversity of Germany. Old towns like Bamberg and L\u00fcbeck with their historical architecture, alleys and squares are attractive for modern people and places with a high quality of life. Nature lovers and technology fans will also find places of interest, as the selection ranges from the Messel Pit Fossil Site to the V\u00f6lklingen Ironworks. Candidates number 43 and 44 The World Heritage title is a special distinction. It attracts international attention and noticeably boosts tourism. That is why new sites are always striving for the coveted title. This year the Viking sites Haithabu and Danewerk in Schleswig-Holstein and the Naumburg Cathedral in Saxony-Anhalt are applying to become the German World Heritage Sites No. 43 and 44. This will be decided by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, which will meet in Manama, Bahrain, at the end of June. The two German candidates have been in the race for some time. The Viking town of Haithabu near Schleswig was one of the most important trading centers in Northern Europe from the 9th to the 11th century. The Danewerk, an early medieval fortification wall, is considered the largest ground monument in northern Europe. The present, revised application has already been certified as World Heritage worthy by the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), an international non-governmental organization for the preservation of historical monuments, which prepares expert opinions for the World Heritage Committee. The chances of Haithabu and Danewerk becoming a world heritage site are therefore very good. The attempt to elevate the Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval cultural landscape at Saale and Unstrut to the status of a World Heritage site has so far failed. The Naumburgers have now followed the committee's recommendation and have submitted a new application for the cathedral only. So in a new attempt they could become a World Heritage site. The German government had also submitted the Jewish cemetery in Hamburg Altona to UNESCO for the World Heritage title. It would be Hamburg's second cultural world heritage after the Speicherstadt. The cemetery for Sephardic Jews, built in 1611, is considered to be the oldest cemetery of Jews who immigrated to northern Europe as a result of the expulsion from Spain. But after a negative assessment by ICOMOS, the Hamburg-based company has withdrawn the application for the time being. They are now working with partners to resubmit it in the coming years as part of a transnational application. Criticism of new development plans in Potsdam A World Heritage title is a great distinction, but also an obligation. In Potsdam, a new building project is causing a stir. ICOMOS Germany has criticized the plans and threatened that the city could be included on the list of endangered world heritage sites. In the worst case, Potsdam could lose the World Heritage status it was granted in 1990 for its park and palace landscape. The planned dense development is too close to the World Heritage Site and impairs an important axis of vision. However, this year's meeting of the World Heritage Committee in Bahrain will not be addressing this issue. But if the Potsdamers cannot get a grip on the problem, the Potsdam Committee could put Potsdam on the Red List in the coming years and formulate measures that it believes must be implemented in order to maintain its status. If these are then ignored, the World Heritage title may actually be withdrawn.So far, UNESCO has only taken this step twice: in 2007, the title of a nature reserve in Oman was revoked, which was to be reduced by 90 percent for oil and gas production. And in 2009, Dresden had to give up the award again after the city did not let itself be dissuaded from building the Waldschl\u00f6sschenbr\u00fccke bridge over the Elbe. This four-lane bridge irreversibly cuts up the Elbe Valley and thus destroys the cultural landscape worth preserving, which is how UNESCO justified the denial of the World Heritage title for Dresden at that time.",

"story": "Republican vice-presidential candidate Ryan attacks Obama Paul Ryan, the US Republicans' vice-presidential contender, has accepted his party's nomination at its convention with a verbal attack on the economic polices of President Barack Obama. Ryan, a Wisconsin congressman regarded by Republicans as their fiscal expert, accused Obama of enacting \"big government\" policies and presiding over ballooning debt and joblessness. \"The choice is whether to put hard limits on economic growth or hard limits on the size of government, and we choose to limit government,\" Ryan said. \"We are going to solve this nation's economic problems,\" Ryan said while hailing the Republican's presidential candidate Mitt Romney as the man with business acumen to give America a \"turnaround.\" \"I have never seen opponents so silent about their record and so desperate to keep their power,\" said Ryan, who was little-known nationally or internationally until he was named as Romney's running mate on August 11. Speech awaited from Romney On Thursday, Romney is due to formally accept the Republican presidential nomination at the convention after three days of motivational addresses by party stalwarts. Obama's campaign team hit back on Thursday, accusing Ryan of misleading voters of Republican intentions on Medicare, which Obama recently reformed, and a deficit reduction plan discussed in Congress. Obama's team mocks Ryan \"If Paul Ryan was Pinocchio his nose would be back in Janesville about now,\" said Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki in a reference to Ryan's hometown in Wisconsin. Obama is due to accept the Democratic nomination to run for a second term in the White House at his party's convention next week in Charlotte, North Carolina. Romney and Obama have been running close in most national surveys of voters ahead of the November 6 election. Unemployment, which approached 10 percent in the aftermath of the 2008-2009 recession, remains at 8.3 percent in the United States, while second-quarter economic growth was 1.7 percent. ipj/rg (Reuters, AFP)",

"story": "'A decision in the name of sport itself' The IOC has decided Russian athletes will be allowed to participate in the Rio Olympics. Andr\u00e9 Hahn from the Left Party considers this a fair outcome. DW: Mr. Hahn, what do you think of the IOC's decision to allow the Russian team to participate in the Rio Games subject to certain conditions? Andr\u00e9 Hahn: I think the IOC has made a fairly wise decision. Unlike some critical voices I believe it's the IOC's responsibility to protect the competitiveness of clean athletes and make sure they can participate in the Olympics. There are surely numerous athletes in Russia who have never doped and would therefore have suffered most from a blanket ban. My personal credo has always been to punish all those linked with doping, including athletes, doctors and officials, but not an entire nation as long as there is not sufficient evidence. You can't, for example, simply ban innocent Russian archers only because there were cases of doping in the Russian track and field or weightlifting squads. Therefore I believe the IOC has made a decision in the interest of sport itself. A blanket ban would have distorted the competition in many other disciplines that are largely free from doping, and I don't think that would have been a fair decision either. But the McLaren report concluded that an \"institutionalized, government-run doping program\" existed in Russia. Moreover, 14 national anti-doping organizations urged the IOC to fully ban the Russian Olympics team. Is it justified simply to ignore this? First of all, I found this recommendation quite problematic, as it was made before the publication of the McLaren report. I don't think this was an appropriate way to proceed. I fully understand the demand to implement harsh drug tests in every country. But this does not solely apply to Russia. The current issue must be handled on a case-by-case basis, and those who have doped should of course be banned from the Olympics. The preconditions imposed by the IOC make sense: Every athlete must provide a negative drug test conducted abroad by international authorities. It seems likely quite a few athletes will fail to do so and will therefore not participate in Rio. Russian athletes will travel to Rio within the next couple of days. Some of them may then be forced to return to their home country if they are unable to meet the criteria. Isn't this a problematic - or even \"chaotic\" situation, as some have stated? The chaos you are mentioning primarily stems from the IOC's failure to deal with the situation sooner. The Olympics will start just a few days from now, multiple athletes have already travelled to Rio in order to settle in, which was impossible to prevent. However, I am certain the Russian Olympic Committee knows who has been doping. As a result, I expect the number of Russian athletes nominated for the Olympics to decrease significantly. I strongly assume there are enough responsible coaches as well as officials in Russia who will make sure their Olympic squad is free of doping. \"I genuinely hope Russia will now seriously commit to eradicate doping\" So you do believe there is a serious commitment in Russia to eradicate doping? Well, at least I genuinely hope Russia will now seriously commit to eradicate doping in the near future, for this apparently has not been the case in the past. We've heard grave accusations linked to the Sochi games in 2014, declared by witnesses who we should trust since they were part of the system. This is a very serious issue. The key question now is whether we impose a collective ban against every single athlete or revert to the principle of solely punishing those who are proven guilty. I prefer the latter. As far as I know the Court of Arbitration for Sport will be responsible for determining that all legal criteria are met by the athletes. In my opinion this is the right approach. There are, however, other voices. Some of them claim that while imposing a blanket ban would have been unjust towards certain athletes, the decision not to do so has severely damaged the Olympic idea. What do you think is more important? The right of an athlete to be treated on a case-by-case basis or the need to restore the IOC's reputation? The fact the IOC has a negative image is far from surprising, due to doping and several other factors. Over the last few years the Olympic idea has suffered due to things like increasing commercialization and the skyrocketing cost of hosting major sports events. Doping is just another factor contributing to the IOC's bad reputation. In this context it is vital we can count on a fully independent World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) which has not always been the case. For example, WADA's former president served as vice president of the IOC at the same time, which I regards as problematic. Moreover, we have to make sure there are sufficient numbers of independent anti-doping labs. There is a clear lack of those facilities in many regions around the world. Furthermore no positive drugs tests should ever again be withheld from the public, which used to be common practice in cycling. There were a number of prominent cyclists - from the US as well as from Germany - who were eventually found guilty of doping and individually punished. Nobody, however, ever entertained the idea of banning all German or American cyclists from major competitions including the Olympics. But once we were dealing with the Russians, there were calls they for be banned altogether. Dr. Andr\u00e9 Hahn, who was born in the former East Germany, has been a member of the German Bundestag representing the Left Party since 2013. He currently serves as his party's spokesperson on issues regarding sports.",

"story": "Design spans generation gap in aging Germany What would their grandparents say? That's what design students from two German schools asked themselves. They found that designing everyday objects for the elderly is both a creative challenge and a smart career move. \"In 30 years, one third of the German population will be over 60 and will still hold a considerable purchasing power,\" explained Lilly Bozzo-Costa Wolf, the Leipzig architect who came up with the idea for a unique design project. \"I wanted to approach ageing with humour and this is something that young people can teach you best,\" said Bozzo-Costa Wolf, who got the Burg Giebichenstein University in Halle and the Academy for Applied Arts in Schneeberg on board, along with the Free University of Bozen in Italy. Named \u00dcber60 (Over 60), the project is an attempt to \"turn design for seniors into something appealing for the next generation of designers.\" The architect decided to collaborate with students after seeing a student exhibition which convinced her that eastern Germany is full of young design talent. Death is age's unwanted neighbor Markus Rossnagel and Robert J\u00e4hnen were two students who took on the challenge of putting themselves in the shoes of an elderly person. But their tutors were not impressed when the young men teamed up to create a gravestone. Rossnagel and J\u00e4hnen took an entrepreneurial approach. \"We were looking for some gaps in the market,\" they said. \"We talked with our grandmothers and discovered that it is a huge burden for old people when their spouse or relatives die. They have to pay a lot for a funeral and a gravestone.\" So the student designed a gravestone that is affordable and practical, but also stylish. Made of steel and hollow inside, the gravestone opens at the back to reveal a storage space. Rossnagel and J\u00e4hnen added a lock because they observed that cemetery visitors, mainly elderly women, are afraid that their grave decorations may get stolen. The front of the gravestone can be engraved using laser technology. Some people were shocked when they saw their piece, \"but the elderly people were very happy that we focused on this theme,\" said Rossnagel. \"The issue is there, you can't deny it: If no one wants to think about it, the circumstances won't improve,\" added J\u00e4hnen. Their entrepreneurial spirit was rewarded. \"I heard a man saying to his partner: If I die, buy me one of those,\" said J\u00e4hnen. The students are now working with a private investor who wants to launch a line of low-cost gravestones. They have also designed a light gardening trolley that can be used to transport water and gardening tools to maintain a grave. It also serves as a stool when the work becomes too strenuous. \"If two people meet with a trolley, they can have a seat and talk,\" said Rossnagel. Removing physical limitations Carolin Schultze, a student in wood and furniture design, came up with what she calls her \"mobile plant station\" when she understood that physical limitations are what keep her grandparents away from their biggest passion: gardening. The mobile plant station is a combination of a double shelf and a table on wheels, with holders for pots and gardening tools. It allows the gardeners to take care of their plants without having to lean and bend their knees as everything happens at waist height. Like many of her fellow students, she designed a multipurpose product. Place a salad bowl in the flowerpot hole and some champaign glasses in the tool holders and you have a portable picnic table. \"When you are old it is really important to have hobbies and to have a task. The elderly have a special relationship to plants, flowers and nature. I think that this relation with plants will grow for me as well,\" she said. A stick for any situation Paul Jacob was a carpenter before enrolling in design school, where he wants to learn how to give his products a creative edge. He has already established his own wood design label in Dresden. Like Schultze, he built his objects - an equipped wall and multipurpose walking sticks - with his own hands. Jacob realized that elderly people would not use a walking stick even if they need one because \"it makes you look old.\" He wanted to offer something different by designing curved walking sticks. Inspired by a friend who has a music instrument shop, he then inserted a bass chord in the curve of the cane. By using a door or a trash bin as sounding board, the stick transforms into an easy-to-play monochord bass. For those who are more interested in security then in tunes, another version of his curved sticks can be used for self-defense. Jacob wants to work for this growing market \"People who are in their 50s and 60s right now are in demand for useful and stylish objects,\" he said. For him, being old and feeling old are two different things: \"If you stay creative there will be the physical limitation but in the end you will still be young.\" Preparing for the worst During their first meeting in Halle in eastern Germany, the students visited nursing homes for dementia patients and talked with health and care professionals. Project director Bozzo-Costa Wolf asked the students to think about their \"aged self\" and think about what it might be like if they were sick, poor or lonely. Phillip Stingl took up the challenge to its extreme and imagined the life of an elderly homeless person in a dystopian future. \"Social systems will have collapsed and the elderly will have to use bins as living space,\" he theorized. The result was a common yellow trash bin transformed into a tiny apartment. While the upper part is still devoted to its original function of stacking trash, the body is one of the world's smallest flats. Stingl wanted to make it as livable as possible by adding a water container and emergency devices, but he also added decorations and a peephole to make it cozy and safe. His work was among those that excited the strongest reactions. Many didn't understand right away that he intended it as a critique of contemporary society. \"I learned that it is a huge matter how you communicate things, especially objects that are in between art and design. If it is placed in a museum people would take it immediately as art, but if they see it in a magazine, it's taken as a realistic house for tomorrow, which it is not,\" commented Stingl. In April, the students who participated in the Over60 project will go to Milan to exhibit their works at FuoriSalone, a series of exhibitions that take place during the major biggest furniture fair, il Salone del Mobile. Most of the students want to continue designing for the over-60 market. As Markus Rossnagel put it, \"I discovered that there is a lot more you can do besides designing stools and tables.\"",

"story": "Bolivia's Morales fighting for political survival Evo Morales has governed Bolivia for over a decade and his term is set to expire in 2020. A referendum is being held to allow Morales to run for another term. DW's Jan D. Walter reports on the president's standing. Bolivia's Evo Morales has long been considered one of Latin America's most beloved presidents. In 2014, the most recent general election, his \"Movement toward Socialism\"received more than 60 percent of the vote for the second time. A referendum to be held on Sunday (21.02.2016) will have the people deciding if Morales can run for another term. A year ago, that wish would have been fulfilled; over the last few months however, Morales has lost steam. Regional and communal votes have seen MAS candidates losing important offices. Morales must also be wary of losing more supporters should an economic downturn forecast through 2017 balloon into a crisis. His proponents have become fewer as people begin to believe that Evo Morales' politics are neither intended for all Bolivians nor for all Indigenous peoples. The voice of those without rights The head of a coca farmer's union became the \"first indigenous president in Latin America\" back in 2005 with that promise. At least that's how Morales fancied himself. Even before him, Bolivia and other Latin American states had previously had heads of state with indigenous roots. And Morales didn't exactly fit the cultural picture he'd created of himself. Neither did he grow up in an indigenous community nor did he speak the language of the tribe. Yet the message he wanted to sell came across clearly: Evo is a man from the middle of the native underclass. His success came as something well-deserved, according to German aid worker Anne Weiss. \"He gave these people a voice.\" Anne Weiss is a pseudonym for a woman who has spent more than 30 years looking after social projects in Bolivia; she doesn't want to give her real name for fear that her organization's work may suffer. Corruption and oppression That alone should say plenty about how Morales and his political party are attempting to consolidate their power. Reports that critics and opponents are being threatened are multiplying. Those who support the regime can hope to be rewarded, say observers. The latest corruption allegations hit the president himself - and that just one week before the referendum. Morales is said to have handed out a contract worth an estimated 500 million euros to the Chinese company CAMCE; his ex-wife sits on the board of the company. Such accusations could be intentionally spread. But Morales has prepared for this. \"The majority of the media in Bolivia is government-controlled. The very few independent media outlets there have chosen to self-censor in order to avoid problems,\" according to the country report for Bolivia put out by Germany's Konrad Adenauer Foundation. Indiscriminate financing of the social state As frequently as the media repeats the stereotype of the earth-loving indigenous, so too is the frequency with which it has become clearer to Bolivians that something is not right. The number of cases in which the government stamps out the rights of the indigenous community has increased. Above all, these communities are affected by the exploitation of natural resources like natural gas and ore. State-run companies make no detours around the lands claimed by indigenous communities in order to get at those raw materials. The income gained is too important as it fills the koffers from which the MAS finances its social projects. Economic turbulence up ahead How much longer this will continue to go well dependes on sinking prices of raw goods. Instead of using the boom times of recent years to create sustainable structures, or at least to construct reserves for harder times, Morales increased consumption and along with that inflated growth. It's already apparent in Venezuela and Brazil where that will lead. Economists have predicted a downturn soon for Bolivia's flourishing economy. Private businesses will have a tough time as the state's minimum wage doesn't allow for much wiggle room to compensate for a decrease in demand. \"Small businesses are already closing because they cannot compensate for the last increases to the minimum wage,\" said Weiss, the aid worker. Good intentions don't match the reality Weiss can name many examples which were driven by good will, but which don't match the realities of the situation on the ground. Such as: all teachers should learn Quechua or Aymara, the indigenous languages. But what do the Guarani achieve with this? In Bolivia, there are more than 30 indigenous languages. A school that Anne Weiss' organization works with may need to close soon if they cannot decrease class sizes from the 50 or 60 students currently in each class down to the maximum of 30. \"Of course that'd be ideal, but we have neither the physical capacity nor the personnel to accomplish that.\" For the pupils, the school's closing would mean that they would no longer be able to attend school. \"Out on the street there are drug gangs that offer the kids attractive prospects.\" Morales' penultimate chance Whether Evo Morales has a chance to win a re-election in 2019 is more than unclear. In 2013, the Venezuelan regime was able to gain a majority of the vote, despite disastrous economic policies. Between now and 2019, a lot can happen. For now, it's a question of whether or not Morales can even run as a candidate. The country analyst at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation says the timing is right: the economy is still strong enough. And government employees have just received the so-called double Christmas bonus that is an obligatory part of the minimum wage. The government has even garnered the sympathies of its opponents by being able to bring their Chilean neighbors back to the negotiating table with the help of the courts in The Hague. For over 100 years, landlocked Bolivia has been fighting with Chile to gain access to the Pacific. Whether or not a return to the table ends up sufficing for Morales remains to be seen on Sunday.",

"story": "Goethe Institute Picks Up Long German Tradition in Latvia Latvia has traditionally had close ties to Germany, ever since its capital city Riga was founded by a German in 1201. Now the Goethe Institute is stepping up efforts to restore interest in learning the German language. The kids clap their hands as Thomas Diekhaus is abruptly interrupted while reading \"Max and Moritz,\" a famous 19th century poem about the antics of two naughty boys. Their caps pulled down low on their heads, two real life boys dressed as Max and Moritz have snuck up onto the stage. Diekhaus directs the language department of the Goethe Institute in Riga, Latvia, and wants to encourage the children to learn German. There's lots of work to be done, he said, because the number of German learners has dropped by 10 percent to 11 percent every year since 2000. 800 years of common history Latvia's German connection is hundreds of years old. In 1201, Bishop Albert from Bremen founded the city of Riga, now the capital, where the Daugava River flows into the Baltic Sea. As a member of the Hanseatic League, many German traders came to Riga and the city flourished. It also became an important center of trade with Russia. When World War II broke out in 1939, most of the Germans living in Latvia moved to Germany. Even while under Soviet rule after the war, Latvia maintained strong connections with communist East Germany, and German continued to be taught as a foreign language. When the Iron Curtain collapsed and the Soviet Union dissolved, Latvian students found a renewed interest in the German language -- particularly when Russian stopped being offered in schools in 1991. Post-communist business boom Today, some 16 years after the fall of communism in Eastern Europe, Germany has become Latvia\u2019s biggest trading partner. The newly opened Baltic region became an attractive investment location for numerous western companies. Just outside of Riga, the German company Knauf produces plasterboard that is sold throughout the Baltic region. All of the management personnel have to speak German, said Knauf manager Peter Rumer, since the Riga branch has daily contact with co-workers in Germany. \"In Latvia it\u2019s not at all hard to find German-speakers -- and good ones at that,\" added Rumer. Shakespeare vs. Goethe According to the Latvian Ministry of Education, however, the trend is heading in the opposite direction. Since English was introduced 12 years ago on the recommendation of the school authorities, the number of high school students taking the advanced German exam has dropped by 50 percent. Unlike the Goethe Institute, the Ministry of Education doesn't see a need for action. \"The Ministry of Education values multilingualism, however the generally tendency in Latvia toward English as a first foreign language can\u2019t be avoided,\" said Gundega Muceniece from the ministry. Meanwhile at the Goethe Institute, Max is smoking on stage. After the first cigarette he gets dizzy and can't get a single German word out of his mouth. Even without words, the children understand that Max and Moritz want to annoy Widow Bolte's proud rooster -- not an unusual pastime for the two pranksters. Catching up \"What people missed at school they have to catch up on at the Goethe Institute,\" said the institute's director Rudolf de Baey. \"That's good for business, but not for German-Latvian relations.\" Max has just promised his friend Moritz that he wants to start learning a few German vocabulary words. After all, both of them want to travel as soon as possible to all of the German-speaking countries in Europe.",

"story": "Williams beats Radwanska to advance to final round of Australian Open Serena Williams will go on to face German Angelique Kerber in her seventh Australian Open final. A victory would bring Williams her 22nd Grand Slam singles title. Williams defeated Agnieszka Radwanska 6-0 6-4 on Thursday, putting her one step closer to matching Steffi Graf's record of 22 Grand Slam singles titles. \"I'm really excited to be in the final - it just kind of blows my mind right now,\" Williams said, according to the Associated Press. The American proved her prowess almost immediately, breaking Radwanska's serve in the opening and easily defeating her opponent in the first set. After putting up a fight in the second set, Radwanska eventually fell to Williams in the ninth game. Favorite to win Williams' opponent in the final round, seventh-seeded Kerber, defeated her opponent, the Brit Johanna Konta, 7-5 6-2. The two players will go on to face each other on Saturday. Williams, the critics' favorite, has gone on to win the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup every time she's made it to the final round. A win for Williams would put her alongside Graf and just behind Australian tennis legend Margaret Court, who holds the world record with 24 Grand Slam titles. blc/jil (AP, Reuters)",

"story": "Saudi Arabia's ambivalent relationship to terrorism Saudi Arabia is often accused of supporting jihadist groups. Now, the monarchy is helping Berlin's security authorities in the fight against terror. What appears to be a contradiction is not. A jihadi inspired rampage in a regional train near W\u00fcrzburg; and a bomb attack - designed to kill a large number of people but gone awry - in Ansbach: Both attacks were supposedly orchestrated by men in Saudi Arabia that gave the attackers instructions from afar, via chat. That is the story the German magazine \"Spiegel\" is reporting in connection to chat protocols in the possession of federal agencies. The magazine also refers to information provided by a high-ranking government official in the Saudi capital Riyadh. According to the official, several telephone numbers show that the two young men were in close contact with the terrorist organization \"Islamic State\" (IS) in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi government has now announced comprehensive cooperation with Germany in investigating the recent attacks in Bavaria. For years, Saudi Arabia has been the source of what has appeared to be contradictory information. First, the country is accused of exporting an extremely conservative strain of Sunni Islam known as Wahhabism, which also happens to be the kingdom's state religion. Shortly after the outbreak of war in Syria, accusations that the monarchy was financing jihadi groups that were not only seeking to topple the Assad government but also create a new \"caliphate\" under the control of the terror organization \"Islamic State\" (IS), grew louder. And finally, for years the West has considered Saudi Arabia to be an important partner in the fight against jihadist terror. Dubious commitment Sebastian Sons, Middle East expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP), tells DW that the news is not as contradictory as it initially seems. \"The Saudi government has been involved in the fight against terror since the attacks on America in September 2001. That was partially a reaction to US pressure. But it was also because institutions in the kingdom were increasingly the target of jihadist attacks as well, first by al-Qaeda and later 'IS.'\" At the same time there are a number of religious foundations in the country, and some of these, as well as a number of wealthy individuals, have great sympathy for the aims of \"IS\" and provide the organization with financing. \"Such money transactions are now being very closely monitored.\" Yet, there is no way to exert total control over them. \"Firstly, Saudi Arabia doesn't have the capacity to do so. And secondly, one has to say that there is serious doubt about whether they have the political will to do so.\" Nevertheless, even if the royal house had the will, it would be able to do little about it. Because the House of Saud, which has controlled the country since it was founded in the eighteenth century, is totally dependent upon the conservative Wahhabis. It is the religious movement that lends the Sauds the ideological legitimacy upon which their rule is based. Alliance between religion and politics The moral foundation for the rule of the Sauds was established by a religious scholar hailing from an area near what is now the capital Riyadh. Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, as the scholar was known, was born in 1703, the son of a judge. Ibn Wahhab developed an entirely new criteria with which to judge the legitimacy of regional rulers. This legitimacy, he said, only existed as long as rulers abided by the tenets of religious faith. Political leaders, according to Wahhab, must comply to the will of god in all that they do. Should they fail to do so, they forfeit their legitimacy. Thus, subjects were given a clear criteria with which to judge their rulers: Do their actions express the will of god, or not? It was a radically emancipating idea, yet it carried the seed of later abuses in it from the start: For who determines what god's will is? Ibn Wahhab came up with a unique solution to the problem: He directly tied religious power to political power. And he did so by seeking out an alliance with the most powerful partner of his day: Prince Saud l., ibn Abd al-Aziz ibn Muhammad al-Saud, the conquerer of the Emirate of Diriyah, the first Saudi state. The prince secured the theological power of his religious partner with his own military might. And in return, the legitimacy of his political rule received the scholar's religious blessing. The alliance between these two families, the ruling Sauds and the descendants of ibn-Wahhab responsible for answering all religious questions in the kingdom, has continued to hold until this day. Unresolved dilemma This alliance, by necessity, also determines the royal family's current reaction to terror. \"The royal family sees terrorism as an extreme security threat, but it still has to align itself with the Wahhabi scholars in terms of ideology,\" says Sebastian Sons. This means that the monarchy is constantly forced to tolerate its - at times radical - world view. They rarely have the luxury of refusing to give their support. \"The structure of the Saudi state is based upon the alliance between Wahhabi scholarship and the House of Saud. That is a unsolvable dilemma for the royal family, even today.\" That means that the rest of the world will have to live with the reality of more attacks being orchestrated from Saudi Arabia. As long as ideological extremism cannot be overcome, security measures can only help to a point.",

"story": "Jammeh defeated in landmark Gambian election Longtime strongman Yahya Jammeh has lost Gambia's presidential election to businessman and political newcomer Adama Barrow. Jammeh has now formally conceded defeat in the polls. In a shock result, Gambia's president Yahya Jammeh has conceded defeat after 22 years in power to political newcomer Adama Barrow, the head of the country's electoral commission said Friday. \"It's really unique that someone who has been ruling this country for so long has accepted defeat,\" Alieu Momar Njie told reporters ahead of the release of the results of Thursday's presidential election. Jammeh has staunchly held onto power since he staged a 1994 military coup that ousted Dawda Jawara, who himself had been president since 1970, just five years after the country's independence from Britain. A little known businessman, the 51-year-old Barrow was picked by a group of political parties to head the opposition ticket under his United Democratic Party. The electoral commission said Barrow received 263,000 votes to Jammeh's 212,000, giving him a five year mandate in the poor country of some 890,000 people. Mama Kandeh, a third candidate of the only opposition party not to join Barrow's coalition, got 102,969 votes. The longtime head of state, who represents the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction party, was expected to make a televised address later in the day. Jammeh, who has previously said that with the will of God he could rule for a billion years, has been accused by rights groups of abuses, including killing political opponents and clamping down on journalists and gays. During his reign he swung the country in an Islamic direction, last year declaring the country an Islamic Republic. Previous elections since he came to power have been marked allegations of rigging. Thursday's election was impacted by an internet backout and a heavy security presence that extended into early Friday. The United States said the voter turn out appeared to be high and took place under \"generally peaceful conditions.\" But the State Department voiced concerned about the arrest of opposition supporters, the internet blackout and disruption of phone services.

"story": "Boy on cruise ship racks up \u20ac12,000 roaming bill A German family received an unwelcome surprise after returning home from a family cruise to Norway. The son had used just under a half a gigabyte worth of data while at sea, and was billed more than \u20ac12,000 as a result. A German family is seeking legal counsel after they arrived back home from a family holiday, only to find a phone bill totaling more than \u20ac12,000 (around $14,000). The family had taken a short cruise from the northern German city of Kiel to the Norwegian capital of Oslo. It was during that trip that the 12-year-old son decided to unwind and watch some videos on his phone. The catch: He was connected to the cruise ship's own phone network, which connects to the internet via satellite. While anyone can join the network, it is generally only intended to be used by the ship's crew to communicate with other vessels. In fact, German mobile phone networks can demand as much as \u20ac30 per megabyte of data downloaded through a satellite connection. The EU's abolition of roaming charges does not apply at sea. Read more: Germany, land of woefully slow internet As a result, the family was ordered by their network provider to pay almost \u20ac12,500 for just 470 megabytes of data. Legal counsel sought The phone network did agree to reduce the bill, admitting it was clear the son had connected to the cruise ship's network without knowing. Nevertheless, it still demanded \u20ac5,000. The family has since employed a lawyer to try and settle what they consider to be an \"immoral\" bill. The Norwegian cruise line operator Color Line said it regretted the incident but that it was unable to help. Read more: Smartphone tariffs: Germany, US charge 'exorbitant' prices Tips for surfing and roaming at sea: Before setting off, ask your network provider what its fees are for making calls and roaming via satellite connection. These will almost certainly be far higher than usual and is almost always best avoided, unless it is an emergency. Before even reaching the port, be sure to disable mobile data usage. This will ensure you don't connect to a docked ship's phone network before you've even set off. Find out if the cruise operator you'll be travelling with offers internet access on board that's intended for travelers, and what the prices and conditions are. While it will be expensive, the pricing will at least be transparent.",

"story": "Vatican-backed Venezuela crisis talks to resume Friday Venezuelan government and opposition leaders prepared to resume talks on the country\u2019s crisis Friday. Neither side is expecting a positive outcome. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and opposition leaders will meet Friday to ease the political standoff and economic crisis gripping the South American nation. Neither Maduro nor Jesus Torrealba, Executive Secretary of Venezuela's coalition of opposition parties (MUD) seemed optimistic heading into the Vatican-backed talks. Both sides declared a delicate truce at the previous meeting on October 30, which required opposition leaders to suspend protests and moves to hold a political trial against Maduro, but insults lobbed by both sides continued. For dialogue to continue, the opposition is demanding the release of more than 100 activists in jail, access for international humanitarian assistance, and the naming of a new board of directors to the elections council. In response, Maduro demanded Congress respect a court sentence that effectively stripped the opposition of a super majority won last year, a sentence the opposition considers fraudulent. Government and opposition forces did not appear optimistic going into the talks scheduled for Friday afternoon. Torrealba has warned that his side will seek early elections, if Maduro refuses a referendum over a possible presidential recall. \"The MUD is seeking an electoral solution to this crisis through the negotiating table,\u201d said Torrealba. \"Venezuela is a pressure cooker. The recall vote was an escape valve, and the government sealed it up.\" Torrealba added the truce was \"over.\" Analyst Luis Vicente Leon said he did not believe Maduro would go through with a referendum. \"The likelihood that the government, in negotiations, will accept a referendum or early elections is practically zero,\" said Leon. If Maduro agreed to a referendum, Leon said, it \"is absolutely certain that would mean handing (the opposition) his head.\" Venezuelan constitutional rules dictate the opposition must secure a referendum before January 10 if it wants to rid Maduro of his duties. If that does not happen, Maduro and his coalition will stay in power until 2019. Mediators at the talks include Vatican envoy Claudio Maria Celli and former Spanish prime minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. \"We need a spirit of respect and coexistence. Dialogue is not only a means for reaching agreement - it is an end in itself,\" said Zapatero. There is a risk of violence surrounding the talks. Anti-government riots in 2014 left 43 dead. Protestors have taken to the streets in protest of Maduro in recent weeks. Maduro has low approval ratings according to recent polls. kbd/rc (AFP, Reuters)",

"story": "The Strange, But True Tale of a Communist Cowboy A new German documentary, \"The Red Elvis\", tells the extraordinary tale of Dean Reed from Denver, Colorado who became a star behind the Iron Curtain. It's common knowledge that thousands of people fled communist East Germany for the West. The fact that a few hardy souls traveled in the opposite direction is far less well-known. The American musician, actor and film director, Dean Reed was one of them. Filmmaker Leopold Gr\u00fcn, who grew up in East Germany, had forgotten about Reed until a friend from the West jogged his memory six years ago. \"I didn't like his music, so he'd never really concerned me very much,\" Gr\u00fcn said. \"It was only when I started looking into his story that I became fascinated because it had so many twists and turns. I discovered a completely crazy world that I had no idea about.\" The bizarre tale of Dean Reed has recently reawakened a flurry of interest. As well as Gr\u00fcn's film -- five years in the making and just opening in Germany -- a biography was published late last year. US actor Tom Hanks is currently working on a feature film with Steven Spielberg about Reed's life with himself in the lead role. New Angle Leopold Gr\u00fcn sees this interest as signs of a need for a change of perspective about the Cold War era. \"We all know that people fled East Germany,\" he said. \"But what could someone's motives have been for going in the opposite direction?\" Called \"The Red Elvis,\" Gr\u00fcn's film does not set out to provide a comprehensive or conclusive account of Reed's colorful and chequered life. The filmmaker is clear: \"This is not a biography.\" Instead, like a puzzle the documentary pieces together film clips, concert footage and a host of interviews, leaving it to the audience to make up their own mind. Not exactly Country-Western By the time the photogenic Reed settled in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), he had already strayed far from his roots. Following a couple of very minor hits in the United States, the singer embarked on a tour of Latin America in the early 1960s that was to prove decisive. Not only did Reed end up at Number One on the Chilean charts, he witnessed grinding poverty during his travels and forged contacts with the Latin American leftist movement, eventually counting Salvador Allende among his friends. In \"The Red Elvis,\" Isabel Allende Bussi remembers with gratitude Reed's support for her father's presidential campaign. \"In his performances in Chile you can see he is genuine,\" Gr\u00fcn said. \"The posing began later.\" Increasingly critical of US foreign policy, Reed moved to Latin America. It was the start of his career as a political activist-cum-entertainer. He also continued to perform further afield, becoming the first US singer to tour the Soviet Union where his repertoire of country-western and protest songs together with his screen idol looks took audiences by storm. In the film, a Russian fan, now living in Reed's home town, reverentially recalls how his appearances in Russia \"were like a holiday for us.\" Her memories have a tragic irony. The singing advocate of socialist policies functioned as a distraction from Soviet realities. \"We forgot that we were oppressed,\" she tells the camera. Propaganda coup The US performer's tours were clearly a coup for Soviet authorities. This did not go unnoticed back home. In 1972, in an article dripping with sarcasm, the US magazine Newsweek commented: \"Reed's success is heavily subsidized by Kremlin authorities. How often do they get an American who looks like apple pie and treads the party line like a trained bear?\" Significantly, Reed never relinquished his US passport, retaining the right to roam. One of the most memorable -- and disturbing -- images in \"The Red Elvis\" shows Reed in Lebanon in the late 1960s, posing with both a gun and a guitar. In Argentina, Reed was given his own TV show to host, but was finally deported after his pro-communist stance got too much for the authorities who were wary of upsetting Washington. After building an acting career in Spaghetti Westerns in Italy, he moved to East Berlin in 1972, meeting his second wife-to-be at a film festival in Leipzig. In East Germany, Reed continued to sing and act, most notably in the blockbuster, East-German Western \"Blutsbr\u00fcder\" (Blood Brothers). Here, the showman created a role tailored to his own character -- a US soldier who goes over to the other side, joining forces with the underdogs after witnessing a massacre of Cheyenne Indians. A rising star behind the Iron Curtain At first, the GDR authorities had not been so keen on his staying, according to Gr\u00fcn. \"They were afraid that he would have an unsettling effect because he was such a showman, but then they realized what a fantastic opportunity he presented,\" he said. \"He stood for the right cause and there was no need to manipulate him.\" Egon Krenz, who was later to briefly succeed Erich Honecker at the top of the East German leadership, has described the relationship between Reed and the authorities as a \"productive\" one, based on \"give and take.\" But while this closeness to the regime may have secured him a celebrity status that he would never have enjoyed in the United States, it was also to prove his downfall. His popularity began to ebb, partly because of his failure to take any kind of critical stance in public. Disillusioned cowboy Over the years, Reed had also become increasingly disillusioned with the less than heroic nature of everyday life in East Germany. And by the mid 1980s, his third marriage to a leading East German actress was also on the rocks. Gr\u00fcn's film gives little credence to the conspiracy stories that have surrounded his death by drowning, which was reported as a \"tragic accident\" on East German television. Reed's long-term mistress and soulmate talks about the suicide pact that they had discussed at their clandestine apartment, still visibly grieving at the fact that he decided to cross this final frontier without her. More than a product of the Cold War? The 90-minute film creates a subtle, multi-layered image of someone whose public and private personas were riven with contradictions. While Dean Reed was, in one sense, very much a product of the Cold War, Gr\u00fcn said he believes his life story still has relevance today. \"One important goal of mine was to make a film that people could identify with in some way. The themes that are dealt with are still topical: the Palestinian issue, Latin America,\" he said. \"In addition to that, it deals with human problems that are not specific to East Germany.\"",

"story": "Germany's Bankrupt Cities to Get Some Relief The federal government plans to relieve cash-strapped German cities like Berlin and Frankfurt by introducing more taxes. Everything from services to swimming pools has been cut during the financial crisis. Frankfurt will close its ballet in 2004. One of Berlin's four major opera houses is also on the chopping block. The financial crisis both major cities find themselves in is being repeated ad infinitum across Germany, where swimming pools and day-care centers have been shut down over the summer months because of a lack of money. Now Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der wants to do something about it. Following a meeting with top politicians and his economic and finance ministers during his vacation in Hanover Monday, word leaked out that Schr\u00f6der planned to relieve the financial burden of Germany's cities to the tune of more than \u20ac4.5 billion ($5.1 billion). More taxes for business, self-employed Though details of the plan have yet to be formally announced, news reports suggested the government would close tax loopholes open to big business and distribute a large portion, some \u20ac854 million in 2004 according to one report, of the value-added tax paid to the federal government each year to the cities. The government would also introduce an occupational tax for freelancers and self-employed. That, together with existing plans to role the social and welfare benefits the city pays its unemployed into one payment, should significantly ease the burden, government members told reporters Monday evening. Opposition politicians, who did not take part in the meeting with members of Schr\u00f6der's coalition government, greeted the plan with suspicion. The general secretary of the conservative Christian Democratic Union told German television that the tax on freelancers and self-employed was especially curious. \"We can't punish\" those who are carrying the burden, Meyer said. No investment, more on the dole After years of expansion and building in German cities, the country's communities find themselves in a downward spiral. Less investment is coming in, meaning lower economic output. Fewer people are paying taxes and more are on the dole. In the past ten years alone, investment has dropped by \u20ac11 billion, according to the German Association of Cities and Communities (DStGB). The most glaring example is the capital. Thanks to a corrupt former government and the collapse of a bank, Berlin is in debt to the tune of \u20ac40 billion. Streets have become endless construction sites, where the money to complete the work has run out. Swimming pools have closed in the heat of summer, and fountains are drying up. \"If these developments continue like this and aren't stopped, then we'll have to cut a major part of these services,\" said Gerd Landsberg, of the DStGB in a radio interview. \"We will make clear that politicians\" have a responsibility.",

At a press conference in Frankfurt on Monday, former national team captain and president of Germany\u2019s World Cup organizing committee Franz Beckenbauer and German Environment Minister J\u00fcrgen Trittin unveiled their vision for a tournament with little negative impact on the environment. \"The whole world will be watching Germany during the World Cup, so we also want to be a role model for the environment,\" said Beckenbauer, adding the effort will promote environmental management in four key areas: water, refuse, energy and transportation. \"Green Goal - the path to a sustainable 2006 FIFA World Cup\" will be backed by the German government, soccer's world governing body FIFA and members of the German business community. The organizers of the World Cup in Germany have set aside \u20ac300,000 ($326,900) for ecological investment; a figure matched by a government sponsored environmental foundation. \"I congratulate the organizing committee on its decision to meet a wide range of environmental concerns with its 'Green Goal' initiative,\u201d said Trittin. \u201cThis is an example of teamwork and tactics at its best. We will set new standards in the environmental sphere via a series of concrete measures.\" Water demand will be immense Resources will be under pressure to deal with demands for drinking water, utilities and irrigation, as fans from the 32 participating countries flock to Germany for the month-long competition. The stadiums used for matches will require alone approximately 42,000 cubic meters of water. Concrete measures designed to deal with this demand include increasing the proportion of water reserves derived from rain. Organizers intend for ecological sources to provide 20 percent of total water used at the tournament. Plans are also in place concerning the regular maintenance of appliances and pipe work to make the water delivery system more efficient. Refuse from food and drink sales is a problem for any major event. With visitors to the 2006 World Cup expected to number in the hundreds of thousands, the \"Green Goal\" operation considers the potential trash problem as top priority. As a result, spectators can expect to use reusable cups and china or plastic dishes rather than throwaway paper plates. This will be strongly enforced at every stadium involved in the tournament scheduled to begin on June 9, 2006. The \"Green Goal\" initiative also hopes to reduce the current energy consumption at the stadiums by 20 percent during the tournament by exploiting energy-saving potential. EnBW AG, one of three 2006 FIFA World Cup official energy suppliers, will supply electricity derived from renewable sources. Tougher targets In a statement, Germany's environment ministry stressed the importance of setting specified targets for water and energy use: \"These are more stringent than usual because, unlike the Olympic Games, the event will be spread across 12 cities in Germany and will generally have to rely on stadiums which already exist.\" In a bid to cut down on the effects of pollution from the exhaust fumes of cars and private vehicles making their way to the venues, the organizers are pushing an efficient and regular public transport network in the cities hosting games throughout the tournament. The target is that at least half of all visitors should arrive at the matches via public transport, compared with a current average of 40 percent for German first division soccer games. Despite the controls outlined by organizers, the 2006 World Cup is still likely to generate an estimated 100,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions in Germany. In an attempt to address the most demanding goal of reducing negative effects on the global climate, these emissions will be balanced by investment in environmental protection in other areas.",

"story": "Opposition to Kashgar Demolition Plans A plan to demolish the historical centre of Kashgar in China's westernmost Xinjiang region has drawn opposition from the Uyghur community, which makes up the majority of the city\u2019s population. According to the government, the buildings in the city centre are dangerous and thus need to be demolished and rebuilt. 900 families have been moved into government housing. Despite an influx of Han Chinese in recent decades, Kashgar is mainly populated by Turkic-speaking Muslim Uyghurs and other Central Asian groups that consider Kashgar as one of the cradles of their culture. According to the old city's demolition plan, 49,000 homes will be destroyed. Henry Szadziewski, the manager of the Uyghur Human Rights Project in Washington DC, expressed great concern stating that Kashgar is one of the centres of Uyghur culture. \u201cThe destruction of Kashgar old city would be a catastrophe for the maintenance of Uyghur traditions. Many of the residents of Kashgar have built their homes and their businesses in the same area. So moving them out of Kashgar old city to very regimented living arrangements, roughly eight kilometres way from the old city would also remove them from their livelihoods too,\u201d he said. Attempt to assimilate Uyghurs into dominant Han Chinese culture Szadziewski also doubted the official explanation and assumed that this was a move by the Chinese authorities to assimilate the Uyghurs. Attempts to assimilate the minority group into the dominant Han culture date back to well before 1949. Gardner Bovingdon, an expert on Xinjiang politics at Indiana University in the United States, said the demolition of Kashgar\u2019s old city showed familiar patterns and compared it to the destruction of the old Uyghur quarter in Xinjiang\u2019s capital Urumqi, which he witnessed in the mid-1990s. He said that it was \u201caimed at transforming neighbourhoods that were under Uyghur control into neighbourhoods that were more susceptible of police control which is generally Chinese control, more susceptible of scrutiny by the government and so forth. And I think those aims are important in Kashgar as well.\u201d No open protests because of political oppression There was a lot of violent conflict in the region in the 1980s and 90s but public protest has declined recently. The demolition of Kashgar\u2019s old city is only openly opposed by exiled Uyghurs. Gardner Bovingdon said that there might be some justification for arguing that a growing Uyghur middle class and economic growth in Xinjiang had satisfied some people in the Uyghur community but he thought that \u201dthe more important explanation is that political oppression has increased in the region in the 2000s.\u201d Some parts of the old city will be maintained for tourists Kashgar, a traditional trading point on the ancient Silk Road, has a long and interesting past with a history stretching over 2000 years. Its beautiful setting in a fertile oasis to the north of the Pamir Mountains and on the western edge of the Taklamakan desert, along with its ancient buildings has made it a major tourist attraction in Central Asia. Marco Polo recorded a visit in the 13th century. Chinese officials have commented that some parts of the old city will be kept for purposes of tourism but this will probably be only a very sanitised version like a kind of \u201copen air museum,\u201d feared Szadziewski. \u201cThis is a pattern that we see in other places in China where old parts of cities are destroyed and then some pieces are left, so that tourists can benefit.\u201d At this point, it is still unclear what exactly will take the place of Kashgar\u2019s old city but its original Uyghur inhabitants will certainly not live there for much longer.

"story": "Rebels shell government controlled Aleppo just day after evacuation Casualties have been reported in Aleppo a day after the Syrian army reclaimed the city. Meanwhile, experts have warned that the battle for Aleppo has left other areas more vulnerable to Islamic State aggression. Three civilians were reportedly killed Friday as Syrian rebel forces launched the first wave of rocket fire into Aleppo on Friday, just a day after insurgents finished withdrawing from the last rebel-held pocket of the city. Ten rockets hit the southern district of Al-Hamdaniyeh, wounding nearly a dozen people. On Thursday, 35,000 civilians and fighters were bussed out of the city following a landmark evacuation agreement brokered by Russia and Turkey. The deal effectively handed control of Aleppo over to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his regime. The Syrian military's recapture of the country's largest city and former commercial hub, made possible by military support from Russia and Iran, marked Assad's most significant victory in the nearly six-year civil war. Friday's offensive is unlikely to be the last, as rebel forces still control much of the territory along the western and southern outskirts of Aleppo, as well as other large areas of the country. Investigating Aleppo's abandoned neighborhoods The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights on Friday reported that the Syrian army and its allies began searching the abandoned districts of the city, clearing explosives and other traps left behind by rebels. Syrian television also broadcast footage of troops seizing crates piled with ammunition, rifles and at least one Russian-made grenade launcher stored in a school basement in the neighborhood of Zaydiyeh. Syrian officials also reported alleged \"criminal acts\" carried out by rebels before they fled eastern Aleppo. These include reports that rebels had killed dozens of prisoners before evacuating the city. Rebels have strongly denied these accusations. 'IS' also make gains Experts warned Friday that the Syrian regime's all-out assault on Aleppo enabled the self-proclaimed \"Islamic State\" (IS) jihadist group to recapture territory elsewhere, including the historic Syrian city of Palmyra. Charles Lister of the US think-tank Middle East Institute told news agency AFP that the \" resources deployed (by Damascus and its allies) to retake Aleppo have allowed IS to claim a series of opportunistic victories\" in Syria. Jonathan Mautner of the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) wrote on the think-tank's blog that \"Russia and Syria prioritized the defeat of the opposition in Aleppo city over the defense of Palmyra from IS, ultimately enhancing the threat posed by Salafi-jihadist groups in both northern and eastern Syria.\" The recapture of Palmyra, which IS reclaimed on December 11 after losing it in March, highlighted \"the inability of pro-regime forces to establish security across the entire country without sustained support from Russia and Iran, notwithstanding their recent success in Aleppo city,\" Mautner said. Despite its recent gains, IS still only controls half the area it seized in Syria and Iraq in 2014. However, some officials expect Moscow to only support the Assad regime in recapturing the \"useful\" territories, leaving the fight against other IS-occupied areas to the West. The biggest challenge, however, remains the recapture of Raqqa, the jihadists' Syrian \"capital.\" From there they have orchestrated terror attacks on Europe and Arab countries. The Syrian Democratic Forces, an Arab-Kurdish alliance backed by the US, launched an offensive to take the base in early November, but has yet to capture it. dm/kms (AFP, AP, Reuters)",

"story": "EU deplores recent events in Iran The European Union has released a statement expressing serious concern after the deaths of Iranian protesters and called on Iranian authorities to allow peaceful demonstrations. Iran's state media had announced that seven protesters were killed when a massive rally against the disputed re-election of Mahmoud Amhadinejad turned violent. A spokesman for the European Commission urged Iranian authorities to allow peaceful demonstrations in the country where civil unrest appears to have reached levels unseen since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. \"The commission is indeed very concerned,\" said spokesman Amadeu Altafaj Tardio. \"We regret the violence and the loss of life and we call on the Iranian authorities to respect the right to demonstrate in a peaceful manner. \"We underline the right to protest in a peaceful way, which must be respected by the Iranian security forces,\" he added. The Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned a senior European diplomat on Tuesday to complain about the EU's reaction to the fatalities in the capital Tehran. \"Neither the European Union nor other countries are in a position to have the right to make rude and interfering remarks against Iran, especially about our glorious election,\" the Foreign Ministry told the Czech charge d'affairs, Josef Havlas. A willingness to recount An Iranian state television broadcast said on Tuesday that the country's supervisory body, the Guardian Council, was ready to carry out a recount of some votes, and added that this could lead to changes in candidates\u2019 tallies. But council spokesman Abbasali Kadkhodai rejected a call from the main opposition challenger, Mir Hossein Mousavi, to annul the vote. \"Based on the law, the demand of those candidates for the cancellation of the vote, this cannot be considered,\" Kadkhodai told state television. The results of the presidential poll have been met with fury by opposition supporters. On Monday night, hundreds of thousands of Mousavi's followers took to the streets to decry what they say was foul play at the ballot box. Iranian state radio said the 'illegal' rally turned violent towards the end, when a military post was attacked with the intention of looting the weapons inside. \"Illegal demonstration\" The broadcast said thugs taking part in the \"illegal\" demonstration in Tehran had \"attacked and vandalized a number of public and government buildings,\" in what it described as an \"organized and coordinated\" event. \"Unfortunately, seven of our citizens were killed and a number of them injured,\" the radio broadcast stated. A source told the AFP news agency however that the emergency services claimed eight had been killed and many more injured in the incident. An unnamed nurse at a city hospital said 28 people with bullet wounds had been brought in, and that eight of them had died. State television has since said that authorities have arrested the \"main agents\" in the post-election unrest, but it did not say how many had been detained. Planned protests Earlier, Mousavi's supporters announced plans to hold another rally on Tuesday, this time at the same central Tehran square where President Ahmadinejad celebrated his controversial re-election victory on Sunday. But following calls from hardliners loyal to Ahmadinejad for a counter protest in the same place just one hour earlier, Mousavi has appealed to his supporters to protect their lives by not showing up. A spokesman for Mousavi said the \"moderates' rally\" had been cancelled. But the pro-Ahmadinejad rally is expected to go ahead. An organization affiliated with the government was quoted on Iran's Fars news agency as saying it would be held \"in protest against the recent agitation and destruction of public property.\" Call for peaceful action Meanwhile the country\u2019s top dissident cleric Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri has appealed to opposition followers to act peacefully. He issued a statement to the \"noble and oppressed Iranian nation,\" in which he appealed to everyone, but especially the nation\u2019s youth, to pursue their rights with \"patience and restraint.\" He said protesters should preserve the \"calm and security of the country and avoid any violence,\" adding that their presence at public demonstrations was a clear show of support for defeated presidential candidates in pursuit of the \"violated rights.\" tkw/sjt/AP/AFP/reuters Editor: Susan Houlton",

"story": "In Cairo, German foreign minister offers aid and encouragement Guido Westerwelle pledged development aid and wide-ranging cooperation on a trip to Egypt. Promising a \"partnership of equals,\" he compared the Egyptian revolution to German reunification 20 years ago. On a trip to Cairo Wednesday, German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle offered Egypt about 30 million euros ($41 million) in aid and said he hoped that the democratic process there would help to improve Egyptians' lives. The visit came less than two weeks after chaotic protests brought down the government of authoritarian Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Westerwelle met with officials in Egypt's transitional government including his counterpart Abul Gheit and Defense Minister Mohammed Tantawi, who is Egypt's de facto head of state while the military runs the country. Westerwelle said he did not come to patronize Egyptians, but to offer a \"partnership of equals.\" During a stop in Cairo's Tahrir Square, which was the center of the anti-Mubarak protests, he compared Egypt's revolution to the reunification of Germany twenty years ago. \"Tahrir Square is for Egypt what the Brandenburg Gate is for us Germans,\" he said. \"We Germans have our peaceful, liberal revolution behind us. We wish the same for Egyptians.\" Economic focus The German aid package for Egypt consists of 8 million euros ($11 million) to boost youth employment and 20 million euros ($28 million) in \"micro credits.\" Details about the micro credits were not immediately available. Westerwelle called for European markets to be more open to Egyptian products, and said from Germany's point of view, \"normal tourism is again possible.\" About 1.3 million Germans visited Egypt last year, but the revolution devastated the North African country's tourism industry. The German foreign minister also promised Egypt close economic and political cooperation, support in building a civil society and an independent judiciary, educational development and student exchanges. Calls for progress Along with Egyptian officials, Westerwelle met with opposition leaders including Nobel Peace Prize winner Mohammed ElBaradei. Westerwelle was not scheduled to meet with the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest and most controversial opposition group. Westerwelle said that Egypt's transition to democracy should bring about improvements in life for all Egyptians. He said people should be able to notice freedom and democracy bringing prosperity to families and opportunities to young people. Following Mubarak's ouster, the Egyptian military dissolved the country's parliament and assumed control of the government. Egyptian Foreign Minister Abul Gheit told Westerwelle the transitional government has not yet set a date for elections, but that the military would step down within six months. Gheit added that authorities would soon release all political prisoners. Westerwelle was the fourth European political leader to visit Egypt this week. He followed British Prime Minister David Cameron, European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini.

"story": "Winterkorn to stay CEO at Volkswagen German carmaker Volkswagen (VW) has ended the crisis in its top management which pitted CEO Martin Winterkorn against VW's powerful board chairman Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch. Winterkorn's contract is set to be extended. A week-long power struggle at German carmaker Volkswagen (VW) came to an end on Friday, with the six-member presidium of the company's supervisory board saying it would recommend extending the contract of Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn beyond 2016. The presidium said in a statement that Martin Winterkorn was \"the best possible chief executive\" for Volkswagen. Winterkorn was under pressure after VW's powerful Board Chairman Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch withdrew his backing for the CEO, telling German news magazine \"Der Spiegel\" on Friday last week that he was \"at a distance to Winterkorn.\" On Friday, the presidium, however, said that it set \"great store by the fact that Winterkorn should continue to act in his function as CEO as actively and successfully as he has done in the past.\" \"He has the full support of the presidium, which will propose that his contract be extended at the supervisory board meeting in February 2016,\" the statement added. The announcement came after a crisis meeting of Volkswagen's inner circle in the Austrian city of Salzburg on Thursday that had industry experts wondering whether Pi\u00ebch would kill off his own prot\u00e9g\u00e9. After less than three hours, the meeting was adjourned. The six-member leadership committee and Winterkorn left without saying a word. A twisting road The power struggle at Germany's biggest carmaker came as a surprise to everyone, including VW's second-most powerful man, and Pi\u00ebch's own cousin, Wolfgang Porsche. The story took an unexpected turn, when, less than 48 hours after launching his verbal attack, some of Pi\u00ebch's most trusted allies began defecting: From the state of Lower Saxony, which holds a 20-percent stake in the company, to Pi\u00ebch's own family. \"Dr. Pi\u00ebch's statement reflects his private opinion, which is not aligned\u2026with that of the family,\" said Porsche, who also chairs the Porsche SE holding company, which owns a 51-percent in the 12-brand VW group. By Monday, a throng of supporters had lined up behind Winterkorn. \"We have in Mr. Winterkorn an outstanding industry leader and CEO, who has our full trust,\" VW Deputy Chairman Berthold Huber, also a former chairman of the powerful IG Metall trade union, told Der Spiegel. The company's council also refused to withdraw its backing of an extension of the CEO's contract, set to run out end of 2016, according to an unnamed source. As the dust began to settle, Pi\u00ebch was left looking increasingly isolated. Strictly business But insiders disagree as to the 78-year-old patriarch's motives. Anonymous sources had said that the chairman had grown increasingly unhappy with Winterkorn's performance, particularly for his failure to turn around disappointing sales in the crucial North American market - something he had expressed at several supervisory board meeting over the past five months. Recent earnings reports may have provided Pi\u00ebch plenty of ammunition to sustain his attack on Winterkorn - and win over skeptics: VW's first-quarter sales tanked in several key markets. Demand for the group's core brand dropped 1.3 percent, with deliveries down 9.3 percent in the US and 0.6 percent in China. The Russian market bled the most as Volkswagen suffered a 47.2-percent sales cut, amid continuing Western sanctions over Moscow's involvement in the Ukraine crisis. uhe/hg (AFP, Reuters, dpa)",

"story": "Ukraine, financial crisis overshadows EPP convention Vitaly Klitschko and Yulia Tymoshenko have addressed delegates at the European People's Party (EPP) convention in Dublin - but it appears they both expect too much from the EU. Delegates of the conservative European People's Party (EPP), a grouping of center-right parties in the European Parliament, have met for a two-day congress in Dublin on Thursday (06.03.2014) to nominate a front-runner ahead of elections in May. The winner could well become the next president of the European Commission - that is if the EPP, now the largest political grouping in parliament, manages to secure most of people's votes again. However, delegates are talking about little else but Ukraine. Before the debate kicked off, EPP's chairman Joseph Daul had asked for a minute of silence \"in remembrance of the Ukrainian victims who have died for their flag and also for the European flag, which symbolizes our set of values,\" he said. \"We will never accept aggression against a sovereign state.\" However, what was meant as strong support for Ukrainians may ring hollow to many. After all, what can the EU, let alone a European party, really do against the de-facto Russian occupation of the Crimean Peninsula? Expectations are too high Ukrainian politicians Yulia Tymoshenko and Vitaly Klitschko had both been invited to speak to the delegates. Former heavy-weight boxer Klitschko had led demonstrations against President Victor Yanukovych in Kyiv for weeks, while Tymoshenko was freed from prison as soon as Yanukovych was ousted. However, their expectations on what the EU could do were far from being realistic. Both politicians offered no clear answer to the question what the EU could do about the Crimean issue. However, Klitschko said his first goal was \"Ukraine's accession to the EU\", secondly, \"immediate talks with NATO.\" But both his demands are out of reach. The EU has practically given up on Ukraine becoming a member of the bloc - even under a pro-European government - while NATO is relieved it is not obliged to defend non-member state Ukraine against Russia. Financial crisis lingers on Apart from Ukraine, there is a second crisis at hand - the bloc's financial crisis. Consequences are still being felt in many countries, particularly in Ireland. Despite the country's success at leaving Europe's bailout program, Ireland has been paying a heavy price in terms of high unemployment and poverty. Demonstrators put up a banner in front of Dublin's Convention Center where the EPP delegates have gathered that reads: \"Merkel and EPP, austerity kills us.\" For some of Ireland's citizens it seems to be German Chancellor Angela Merkel who is responsible for their plight. The two crises could now indeed overshadow the party's task at hand: to nominate a front-runner for upcoming elections.",

"story": "Submarine to be deployed in search for missing Malaysian Airlines plane Australian officials have said they will deploy a submarine to search for any wreckage of missing flight MH370 on the seafloor. The move will bring the search underwater 38 days after the plane disappeared. Search crews will, for the first time, send an autonomous submarine to determine whether signals detected by sound-locating equipment are from the missing plane's black boxes, the Australian head of search Angus Houston said at a news conference Monday. \"Ocean Shield will cease searching with the towed pinger locator later today and deploy the autonomous underwater vehicle Bluefin-21 as soon as possible,\" Houston said. The sub can create a sonar map of the area to chart any debris on the ocean floor, but Houston warned the submarine will not automatically \"result in the detection of the aircraft wreckage. It may not.\" He also said it would be \"a slow and painstaking process,\" because canvassing the area with sub could take six weeks to two months. Over the past two weeks, crews have picked up a series of underwater 'pings' in the southern Indian Ocean consistent with an aircraft's black box, which has helped narrow the area of the search. The batteries in the plane's flight data recorders are now two weeks past their 30-day expected shelf life with the last 'ping' signal logged six days ago. \"Despite the lack of further detections, the four signals previously acquired taken together constitute the most promising lead we have in the search for MH370,\" Houston added. Recovering the plane's black box is essential for investigators to try to figure out what happened to Flight 370, which vanished March 8 while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. Houston also said an oil slick was detected in the current search area, which is about 2,200 kilometers (1,400 miles) northwest of Perth. Several liters of the oil were retrieved for testing but results will still not be available for several days. A visual search for debris was also planned for Monday over 47,600 square kilometers (18,400 square miles) of ocean. hc/av (Reuters, AP)",

"story": "Every country fends for itself in the fight against Boko Haram Boko Haram terrorists have become a threat beyond Nigeria's borders. The governments of the affected states say they have joined forces to combat the extremist group, but their cooperation leaves a lot to be desired. \"There is total panic\" is how Danjuma Hamina from Achigachia describes what is happening in her home town in northern Cameroon. Fighters from the terrorist group Boko Haram had taken control of the town, she said, and \"even hoisted their flag.\" Together with dozens of others, Hamina boarded a train and fled to Cameroon's capital Yaounde. Boko Haram members have been raiding villages near the border between northern Cameroon and Nigeria for several months. But this time things were different, the eyewitness told DW. \"We have not seen an attack like this since the whole Boko Haram thing started,\" she exclaimed. According to the Cameroonian military, more than 1,000 terrorists have attacked several places in the border area in the past few days. They killed numerous civilians and soldiers. After heavy fighting on Sunday (29.12.2014), they briefly seized a military base in Achigachia. Only after Cameroon launched its first-ever air strikes against the terrorist group, did the military succeed in retaking the base. It is still unclear how many people died in the attacks, the Cameroonian military said. But what has become abundantly clear by now is that Boko Haram not only poses a threat to northern Nigeria, but to the neighboring states as well. The Islamists have been carrying out bloody attacks for five years, most of them in the Nigerian states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa. They even control large swathes of the country's northeast, where they have proclaimed the establishment of a caliphate in line with their radical Islamist ideology. They have killed several thousand people and driven between 700,000 and 1.5 million from their homes. Joint declaration of war, but no consequences In the past months Boko Haram has been expanding its activities into neighboring Cameroon, Chad and Niger. For some time now, experts say, the extremists have maintained bases on both sides of various borders as havens to which they can retreat if attacked. The terrorists are recruiting fighters in the neighboring countries as well. Several high-ranking leaders of the group reportedly come from Chad and Niger. While the extremists have again proven that they are capable of cross-border attacks, each of the affected countries has by and large been responding to them on its own. In May 2014, the heads of state of Nigeria and neighboring Niger, Chad, Cameroon and Benin had declared a \"war\" against Boko Haram. At a summit hosted by French President Francois Hollande, they agreed on measures to tackle the terrorist threat, including pooling intelligence, joint border surveillance and an intervention force. But very little has happened since. Not long ago Cameroon again declared that it would cooperate more closely with Chad, Niger and Nigeria, according to Jesper Cullen, a security analyst for the British consultancy Risk Advisory Group. \"But just [now] the Cameroonian government said one of the problems they're really facing is that the limit of their military is the border with Nigeria, and as soon as Boko Haram crosses over, Boko Haram are free to run around pretty much as they want.\" This shows that there is no coordination between the two armies, the expert said. Distrust between intelligence agencies Niger's south has also been massively affected by Boko Haram violence. The president of Diffa's regional parliament says his region has already accepted more than 120,000 refugees from northern Nigeria. \"More come every day,\" Mahirou Malam Ligari said in an interview with DW. The government of Niger, one of the poorest countries in the world, was doing all it could, Ligari said. \"But we need more help,\" he stressed. The wave of refugees is not only a social challenge. Along with the refugees, Boko Haram fighters enter the country. Niger's security forces had already arrested several suspected terrorists, Ligari said. But he warned that the threat of attacks in the border region remained high. Although they have a common enemy, there is distrust among the affected countries. Nigerian media have repeatedly accused Chad's leaders of supporting Boko Haram. Cameroon also suspects that the terrorists are receiving help in other countries. \"You have to ask yourself how a movement like this, whose supply lines have been cut, can continue to cause damage on this scale,\" Cameroonian military spokesman Didier Badjeck told DW. \"This means that behind the scenes strange things are happening with respect to Boko Haram.\" The security forces and the governments in the region do not accuse each other openly. But the massive distrust between them also manifests itself in the lack of cooperation between their intelligence agencies, according to a statement given by Comfort Ero, Africa director for the International Crisis Group, to the news agency AP. \"None of the sides is willing to share information with the other,\" Ero said.",

"story": "Is 'racial profiling' illegal? Depends on where you live Cologne police have been accused of racial profiling after targeting men of North African appearance on New Year's Eve. In the US racial profiling is illegal, but in Germany and the UK the law isn't as clear. There is no law in Germany that explicitly prevents a police officer from stopping and checking someone for the way he or she looks. Police in Cologne have drawn some criticism for focusing their attention on men who looked as if they might come from North Africa this past New Year's Eve. They have denied the accusations of racial profiling, even though the practice isn't expressly forbidden in Germany. Racial profiling refers to procedures in which people are subjected to special checks by police or are detained on the basis of their ethnicity. Germany does have an anti-discrimination law. The general law of equal treatment (AGG) states that all people should be treated equally and not be disadvantaged because of their race, gender, age, religion, sexual orientation or a disability. Anti-discrimination law for private interactions When people feel they have been discriminated against, they can invoke the AGG and present instances where they allege that they were treated unfairly. The burden of proof then lies with the accused - they have to prove that they did not discriminate against the claimant. This law is not applicable in potential racial profiling cases, however, as it covers only interactions between two private parties: for example, between employers and employees. Interactions between the state - represented by police - and an individual do not fall under this law. In general, discrimination is prohibited in the German constitution, the \"Grundgesetz,\" but there is no equivalent to the strict AGG that specifically covers racial profiling by police. In many German states, police are in fact allowed to stop people and check their IDs without providing a specific reason. These \"event-unrelated controls\" were first introduced in Bavaria in 1996 and were instituted in all but three of Germany's 16 states by 2006. The legality of this legislation, however, was called into question by one court that ruled police cannot stop and ask people for ID based on their skin color. Driving while black In the United States, racial profiling has been at the center of heated debates for years. There's even a term for a driver being stopped by officers for no discernible reason other than his or her skin color: driving while black. Going by the letter of the law, racial profiling is illegal in the United States. In June 2003, the US Department of Justice issued its \"Guidance Regarding the Use of Race by Federal Law Enforcement Agencies,\" banning racial profiling by federal law enforcement officials. Back in February 2001, then-President George W. Bush had spoken out against the practice. \"Racial profiling is wrong, and we will end it in America,\" Bush said in an address to Congress. \"By stopping the abuses of a few, we will add to the public confidence our police officers earn and deserve.\" But since the deaths of black men like Michael Brown or Eric Garner at the hands of police, public confidence in law enforcement has suffered, the law against racial profiling notwithstanding. Search without suspicion In the UK, police officers are allowed to search an individual without reasonable suspicion under Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act. A senior police officer has to authorize the use of this policy in his or her district. Ministry of Justice statistics show that black and Asian people are more likely to be searched under Section 60 than white people are, which is why numerous British activists have been fighting the law for years. They accuse the police of racial profiling. But in January 2016 the UK Supreme Court ruled that Section 60 was in accordance with the law and did not need to be changed.",

"story": "Romanian president sacks anti-graft prosecutor Laura Codruta Kovesi After months of legal turmoil, Romania's anti-corruption chief has been fired. Her sacking and controversial legal reforms to weaken corruption charges is raising concern in Brussels.  Romanian President Klaus Iohannis on Monday dismissed the country's top anti-graft prosecutor, Laura Codruta Kovesi, in a move that is likely to raise international concern. Iohannis had for months refused to sack the popular head of the Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (DNA), who the left-wing government accused of overstepping her authority and ordered dismissed. Read more: Romania's parliament passes bill to weaken corruption rules The president said he was forced to comply with a Constitutional Court ruling in May backing the demand of the ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD) to sack Kovesi. \"In a state governed by the rule of law decisions of the Constitutional Court must be respected,\" Iohannis' office said in a statement, adding that the \"fight against corruption will not stop.\" Flanked by dozens of prosecutors, a defiant Kovesi made a televised address calling on Romanians to continue to fight corruption. \"I have a message for the Romanian people: Corruption can be defeated. Don't give up!\" she said. She also accused politicians of seeking controversial legal reforms to weaken criminal convictions for \"protection for the past, the present and the future.\" Romania under EU watch In office since 2013, Kovesi has gained international praise for her drive to fight graft in one of the EU's most corrupt member states. Hundreds of local and national officials, including three ministers, five MPs and a senator, have been prosecuted for bribery, fraud and other corruption offenses. The justice systems in Romania and Bulgaria are under special monitoring of the EU. The European Commission said Monday the independence the Romania's judicial system and the fight against corruption were of \"paramount importance.\" \"The ability of the national anti-corruption directorate to maintain its track record in challenging circumstances was an important sign of sustainability. If this track record ... were to be called into question, the Commission may have to reassess this conclusion,\" said Commission spokesman Christian Wigand. Brewing constitutional showdown Justice Minister Tudorel Toader launched a process to oust Kovesi in February, citing violations of the constitution and her efforts to damage Romania's image abroad. The assault against Kovesi triggered anti-corruption street protests throughout the winter. Iohannis rejected the government's attempt to remove Kovesi after Romania's judicial watchdog said the request was unfounded. However, the government then took the case to the constitutional court, which found that the president was limited to assessing the legality of the removal procedure and was not authorized to oppose the dismissal request that the justice minister legally initiated. Kovesi's sacking comes as the government pushed through judicial reforms last week that critics say would weaken anti-corruption efforts and undermine the rule of law. The new law is viewed by critics as a way to protect PSD leader Liviu Dragnea. Read more: Romania's Liviu Dragnea sentenced over fake jobs scandal Iohannis, who must sign the law for it to go into effect, opposes weakening the fight against corruption The case is likely to head to the constitutional court and lead to a heated political fight. Dragnea is barred from the prime minister post over an electoral fraud charge, but wields influence from behind the scenes. Last month, he received another prison sentence over a fake jobs scandal. cw/aw (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)",

"story": "Studying in Goettingen: In the footsteps of Nobel winners In Goettingen, you can study almost anything while balancing university and private life. The two campuses outside the city center house most of the university's institutes, but students aren't cut off from Goettingen. Georg August University was opened in 1737. It is the largest and oldest still-surviving university in Lower Saxony. In the 2009-2010 winter semester, there were 24,000 students enrolled here. Since 2007, the university's concept for the future has been based on Germany's Initiative for Excellence. One important component of this is creating a connection between the university and other research institutes in the city. This involves the Goettingen Academy of Sciences, the five Max Planck institutes, the German Aerospace Center and the German Primate Center. Tradition and variety What was unusual at the time of the university's establishment is today the norm: thinking for yourself and doing your own research. The 13 faculties offer almost all courses of study except for engineering. Some of the main focus points in research include chemistry, solid-state physics, materials science, biodiversity and mathematics, as well as German language studies, oriental studies, archaeology and theology. The university places a lot of value on having a broad curriculum. Books, books, books A great treasure of the \"Georgia Augusta,\" as the university is sometimes called, are its books. The old library contains some of the most important collections of German science literature from the 18th and 19th centuries. The books are accessible to all students, although they cannot be borrowed. And while this library reflects the glory of the university's early years, the Goettingen State and University Library, located on the humanities campus, shows the university's modern side: well-arranged and spacious. The Nobel Prize wonder So far in history, 12 Nobel Prizes have been awarded to researchers who made outstanding discoveries during their time at Goettingen. Among them is Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976), who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1932 for his work in quantum mechanics. There is also Bert Sakmann (born in 1942), who received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1991 for his findings related to ionic channels within cells. Renowned abroad Goettingen University doesn't only enjoy a good reputation in Germany, but also abroad. This is why each year more than 2,500 foreign students come here to study. Most of them are from China, Poland and Turkey. Mathematics, forestry and philosophical subjects are especially popular among these students. Author: Anna Grabowski",

"story": "Top British judge examines tweeting in court The controversy over tweeting in British courts has reached the highest level, as the head of the judiciary decides on the matter. The case of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has generated renewed interest in the issue. The extradition case against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in Woolwich Crown Court has generated an enormous amount of public interest, in Britain and across the globe. Until recently, anyone wanting to follow each twist and turn of the case would have had to sit in the courtroom itself. But thanks to a new army of tireless court tweeters, people in the court relaying their views in messages on the social network Twitter, the wider public has been able to receive a blow-by-blow account of the Assange hearing wherever they are. One such tweeter is Federica Cocco from the cyberculture organization Owni.fr, who managed 789 tweets in the two first days of the hearing - a total of 13,762 words. Her tweets document in remarkable, pithy detail each speaker and their key contribution. While Cocco may have been the most prolific tweeter, she was certainly not the only microblogger in the room. Mainstream outlets such as the Guardian newspaper, The New York Times and the BBC among others had their own journalists tweeting from the Assange hearing, eager to demonstrate that they too are on the cutting edge of courtroom reporting. The ability to send live updates from inside court is something of a silent revolution, because English courts are notoriously careful about publicity. Andrew Scott, an expert in media law at the London School of Economics, said in Britain, the general rule is that no one should be doing anything in court \"which causes interference with the administration of justice.\" Technology viewed with suspicion Since the presence of television cameras or photographers could interfere with how witnesses, jurors and other people behave, they are all banned, he said. \"Progressively courts have become slightly more willing to allow texting,\" Scott added, but even this is at the judge's discretion. Simply having your phone on could mean that you are at risk of disrupting court, which leads to sometimes strange sight of journalists and others in the public gallery surreptitiously texting into their laps, in an effort not to attract the attention of the legal powers-that-be. The first breakthrough came at Assange's bail hearing in mid-December, when the judge, perhaps swayed by the overwhelming public interest in the case, expressly allowed tweeting and texting in court. But days later that permission was overturned. In an attempt to clarify matters, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales Igor Judge gave a swift, provisional ruling that there was no legal basis for a ban on tweeting from courtrooms, a decision that caused much celebration among microbloggers. But the while the tweeters' battle was won on that day, their war is far from over. On February 7, the Lord Chief Justice announced the start of a three-month consultation on \"live, text-based communication\" in court. Amateur tweeters 'dabbling with danger' Scott said the consultation document highlights the risk that bloggers who aren't journalists could fall foul of reporting restrictions. \"Within 140 characters it's very possible to cast a certain slant on the information you're presenting,\" he said. \"The shorter the message you write the less opportunity you have to elaborate beyond the facts of what's going on,\" Scott added. \"There is a potential problem for non-journalists tweeters where they're much less likely to understand the legal framework within which they're operating and may much more easily, inadvertently, commit breaches of reporting restrictions.\" Whatever the decision at the end of this consultation process, prolific court blogger Cocco said she believes that at least it means the English courts are facing up to the challenges and possibilities of new technology. She pointed out that although currently she is not allowed to bring a camera into court, she could bring her smartphone, which is able to take pictures. \"Maybe they have to look back at the rules, and consider what modern technology can do,\" Cocco said. Scott agreed, calling the upcoming ruling a desirable development. \"It accords very closely with the principle of open justice - the idea that justice not only be done, but manifestly be seen to be done,\" he said. If tweeting in court is seen to adhere to the highest principles of justice, the Assange case certainly won't be the last to be followed live, in 140 characters or less.

"story": "Greek democracy under siege The murder of a left-wing activist in Athens has shaken up Greece and inspired a backlash. The government has now promised to take action against violence from far-right extremists. Has Golden Dawn's far-right squad of thugs struck once again? That's what Athens wants to know following a series of violent incidents in the lead up to Greek elections. Leaders of the far-right Golden Dawn party, Greece's third largest and fastest growing political force - with a rampant anti-immigrant platform - deny that they were involved in the latest round of violence and are threatening to sue journalists who report otherwise. But there is growing evidence that the murderer of an anti-fascist activist in the working-class district of Keratsini in western Athens is at the very least a supporter of the group. The victim was Paylos Fyssas, a prominent left-wing hip hop artist who performed as Killah P. He was stabbed to death in a caf\u00e9 on Wednesday morning (18.09.2013) after watching the Champions League match between Greek champion Olympiakos Priaeus and Paris St. Germain. For unknown reasons, Fyssas became involved in a fight with other customers. According to eyewitnesses, 15 thugs who described themselves as Golden Dawn members attacked the 34 year-old activist and his friends. Shortly afterwards, a 45-year-old man allegedly then joined the fight and stabbed Fyssas. According to eyewitnesses, the perpetrator had not been in the caf\u00e9 before, and had been called to the scene by a cell phone message with the task of killing Fyssas. 'Planned down to the last detail' The division of tasks alone indicates a criminal organization, former vice president of the Greek Lawyers Association Konstantinos Logothetis told the TV station \"Skai\". \"The murderer had nothing to do with the actual fight, so he didn't act in the heat of the moment. Rather he was called to the crime scene specifically tasked to kill. He had both the necessary criminal background and the will to do it. So we're looking at a crime that has been planned down to the last detail,\" the lawyer Logothetis said. Fyssas' murder marks the climax of a series of politically motivated attacks that has been causing a stir in Greece. Last Friday (13.09.2013), eight people were hurt when right- and left-wing extremists clashed in the Athens' district of Perama. And over the weekend, right-wing thugs stormed a memorial event for victims of the Greek Civil War (1946-1949) at the Peloponnese peninsula in southern Greece to attack the keynote speaker. Meanwhile, Panos Kammenos, head of the right-wing populist Independent Greeks party recently encouraged his supporters to \"lynch\" the socialist mayor of a northern Greek resort town. The quest for strategies In an interview with DW, political analyst Tassos Kokkinidis warned of a dangerous polarization of the political landscape. \"The political parties in Greece are mainly concerned with protecting their own short-term interests,\" he said. Many politicians, he said, are still obsessed with scoring points against each other, rather than develop joint strategies to fight right-wing extremism, Kokkinidis argued. \"And yet everyone should know that Golden Dawn is a criminal organization,\" he said. After Fyssas's murder, conservative Public Order Minister Nikos Dendias canceled his trip to Rome to appear on TV and allay Greek people's fears by announcing stricter policies against violence. In light of incidents, the government cannot sit on the sidelines and will significantly tighten laws against criminal organizations, he promised. According to Dendias, it is important that all political forces in the country agree upon how to deal with fascism and politically motivated violence. Fear of escalation Kokkinidis doubts that this proclamation will land on fertile soil. According to him, Syriza, a left-wing party that is currently the second strongest in the country, rejected the proposal to develop a common strategy because it indirectly blames the government for the increase in political violence. Kokkonidis even fears that politically motivated violence could increase in the future after Fyssas' murder. \"There are already calls for acts of reprisal and mass rallies against the Golden Dawn on social media,\" he said. And his fears seem to be coming true. On Wednesday night, protesters and police clashed at the sight of an \"anti-fascist protest meeting\" not far from the crime scene in Keratsini. Anarchists reportedly attacked a police station and set it on fire. In response, law enforcement officers fired tear gas into the crowd. Several people were injured. Surprisingly, right-wing populist Kammenos also appeared at the rally and was attacked and injured by protestors. The European Council human rights commissioner recently suggested banning Golden Dawn, which currently controls 18 seats in the 300-member parliament. According to Athens' online news portal \"To Vima\", the Greek government is now seriously considering this ban. But it may not be enough to simply fight right-wing extremists with political means, said Nikos Xydakis, editor in chief of daily newspaper Kathimerini, on Greek TV. \"Democracy means freedom and tolerance for everyone, but not for those trying to abolish our democracy. Up to now these people have profited from democracy's tolerance but now it is time to let them feel the iron fist of democracy,\" he said.",

"story": "Baseball star Jose Fernandez dies in boat crash Miami Marlins pitcher Jose Fernandez has died in a boating accident off Miami Beach. The 24-year-old ace was one of the brightest stars in the game. Miami Marlins pitcher Jose Fernandez, a two-time All-Star selection and winner the National League Rookie of the Year Award, died in a boating crash early Sunday in Florida. He was one of three men killed when a 32-foot boat collided with jetty off Miami Beach, the US Coast Guard said. The right-hander, who was the team's first round draft pick in 2011 and made a debut in April 2013, was a hero in the Cuban-American community. \"He was one of our game's young stars who made a dramatic impact on and off the field,\" Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. Fernandez was born in Cuba and, after three attempts, made it by boat to the United States with his mother at the age of 15. He became a naturalized US citizen. With his steaming fastball, Fernandez had an average 12.49 strikeouts per nine innings, the best in both the National and American leagues. He pitched a career 38-17 in four seasons with the Marlins. Adding to the tragedy, Fernandez posted pictures on Instagram last week of his girlfriend, saying they were expecting a baby. Fernandez's death drew shock and tribute across baseball. The Marlins team gathered at the ballpark wearing black jerseys. \"A lot of words were said - meaningful words and emotion and prayer,\" team president David Samson said. \"Jose is a member of this family for all time.\" Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spokesman Lorenzo Veloz said it was believed that the boat's speed contributed to the accident. He said drugs or alcohol were not believed to be a factor. \"It does appear to be that they were coming at full speed when they encountered the jetty, and the accident happened,\" he said, adding the star pitcher died from trauma and not drowning. None of the three were wearing life jackets. The names of the other two on the boat were being withheld pending notification of family. cw/rc (Reuters, AP)",

"story": "Chancellor Merkel Tries to Patch Up Differences With Pope Benedict German Chancellor Merkel and Pope Benedict XVI spoke by telephone to set aside their differences over a Holocaust denial by an ultra-conservative bishop. Spokespeople said the talk was marked by \"mutual respect.\" Merkel was the first government leader to take the unusual step of calling on German-born Pope Benedict XVI to demand a traditionalist bishop readmitted to the Catholic Church retract statements he made denying the extent of the Holocaust. The pope and the chancellor explained their views during the conversation on Sunday, Feb. 8, \"with the greatest of mutual respect,\" according to a joint statement released by the Vatican and German press spokesman. \"It was a good and constructive talk, carried by the deep and constant reminder that the Shoah holds for humanity,\" the statement said. The telephone conversation came at the request of the chancellor, who earlier this week aroused the Vatican's ire by saying the Catholic Church had not spoken clearly enough in rejecting Holocaust denial. She was reacting to remarks made by Bishop Richard Williamson, one of four traditionalist bishops with the conservative St. Pius X Society whose 1988 excommunication was lifted by the pontiff. Outcry in Germany The move by Benedict XVI, formerly Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, was condemned by Jewish groups and led to an outcry in his native Germany, where Merkel joined in the criticism. The chancellor came under fire from conservative elements in her Christian Democrat and Christian Social Union alliance, who accused here of meddling in Church affairs. Benedict's decision to rehabilitate the four bishops was seen a sign that the renegade group was willing to reconcile with Rome. But amid mounting pressure, the Vatican eventually issued a statement saying Williamson would have to recant his Holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church. Merkel welcomed the Vatican's statement as \"an important and good signal.\" British-born Williamson, who lives in Argentina, denied there were gas chambers at the Nazis' death camp in Auschwitz and alleging the scale of deaths of Jews under the Nazis was no more than \"200,000 to 300,000.\" He refused to change the stance he made in a Swedish television interview days before his excommunication was lifted but told the German weekly Der Spiegel that he would reexamine the historical evidence. \"If I find proof I would rectify (earlier statements).... But all that will take time,\" he was quoted as saying. An opinion poll in Germany found that two-thirds of German Catholics think the decision to allow Williamson back into the Church was harmful, the weekly Bild am Sonntag reported. Some 56 percent of people polled said Williamson should excommunicated for a second time. The Vatican has said Pope Benedict, who has expressed his full solidarity with Jews, was not aware of Williamson's denial of the Holocaust when he readmitted the bishops to the Catholic flock in an attempt to heal a 20-year-old division in the Church.",

"story": "Corporate maneuvering at Samsung in full swing South Korean corporate giant Samsung has announced the planned merger of two of its companies. The move is widely seen as a measure to strengthen the position of the ailing chairman's son, Lee Jae-yong. Samsung on Tuesday announced the merger of Cheil, the company's fashion business and theme park operator, with the firm's C&T construction and trading firm. News agencies interpreted the move as a step to ensure that the son of the group's ailing chairman inherited control of the conglomerate. Analysts argued the transaction would give Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong a big say in the enterprise, including its crown jewel, Samsung Electronics. Preparing the ground Lee is vice chairman of Samsung Electronics and will own 16.5 percent of the new C&T unit, making him the post-merger firm's largest shareholder. The whole family's direct stake in the combined entity, including that of Lee's father and his sisters, will amount to 30.4 percent. The merger plan comes as Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Kun-hee, 73, has been hospitalized for more than a year after suffering a heart attack in May 2014. Experts said the transaction would be completed by early September. Shares of Cheil and C&T soared by the daily limit of 15 percent on the announcement. hg/pad (AP, AFP)",

"story": "Data Watchdog Questions EU's Controversial Fingerprint Plan A potential scandal over infringements on privacy rights has surfaced in Brussels after it was revealed that the EU is considering launching a fingerprinting drive which would involve citizens as young as six years old. The plans to add fingerprints to the new European passports and store them in a centralized database was launched in Brussels on Oct. 18 by EU Justice, Freedom and Security Commissioner Franco Frattini, the just as European leaders gathered for an important summit in Lisbon, the dpa news agency reported. But after Peter Hustinx, the head of the European data protection watchdog [EDPS], announced the watchdog agency's concerns on Thursday, march 27, EU officials worked to calm fears over the potential for privacy infringements. Hustinx's main concerns focus on controversial plans to fingerprint children as young as 6 years old and elderly people who would be physically unable to provide theirs, as well as the creation of a centralized database, which would hold a copy of fingerprints belonging to all EU citizens. Civil liberties advocates fear that such a database could be violated and used for criminal purposes. EU defends plan to fingerprint children Frattini's office on Thursday rejected calls for the 6-year-old exemption limit to be raised to include children under the age of 14 so that it may be brought \"in line with international practice,\" arguing that the measure was needed to prevent child-trafficking. Officials also said they were willing to address Hustinx's concerns about the centralized database and respond within \"a matter of weeks.\" \"We have just received the comments, and we want to take them serious,\" said Friso Roscam Abbing, Frattini's spokesman. \"Creating big databases poses data-protection challenges, nobody will deny it. However, precisely because we are aware of those challenges we will do everything that is needed to address them ... and ensure that we are taking duly into consideration all legitimate data protection concerns.\" Brussels claims citizens no longer hold concerns Officials in Brussels also argued that a growing number of EU citizens no longer fear being likened to potential suspects simply because their fingerprints are taken, noting that biometric data of this kind has become increasingly common, for instance as an added security measure in laptops. Slovenian Interior Minister Dragutin Mate, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the EU, acknowledged to reporters that the proposal will likely encounter difficulties when it is due to be discussed by the European Parliament and by member states.",

"story": "EgyptAir crash investigator downplays possibility of explosion The head of Egypt's forensic team has downplayed the theory of an explosion bringing down the EgyptAir flight. Investigators are struggling to work out why the Airbus 320 jet crashed with 66 people on board. \"Whatever has been published is baseless and mere assumptions,\" Hisham Abdel-Hamid, head of Egypt's forensic authority, told the country's MENA news agency on Tuesday. Forensic experts had floated the theory of an explosion triggering the crash after they collected wreckage (pictured above) and body parts, believed to belong to the travelers on the flight. They said the largest of these was barely bigger than than the palm of a hand and suggested there had been an explosion. However Abdel-Hamid and other forensic experts downplayed the claim and the government of Cairo also released a statement, warning media outlets \"to avoid chaos and spreading false rumors and damaging the state's high interests and national security.\" Meanwhile, Greek officials said they would start dispatching key data on the disaster on Wednesday. According to a Greek defense ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the plane had lurched violently in mid-air before plunging into the Mediterranean Sea. Egyptian officials however denied they saw the plan swerve on their radar screens. French investigators, who are helping Egyptian officials look for clues, said the plane sent a series of warnings, indicating there was smoke on board and that possible computer faults had occurred shortly before it disappeared. The EgyptAir Airbus 320 was flying from Paris to Cairo last Thursday when it vanished from radar screens and plunged into the Mediterranean Sea. There were 66 passengers and crew members traveling in the plane. Investigators are trying to find the machine's black boxes, which could reveal what went wrong. mg/jm (Ap, Reuters)",

"story": "Rocket strike kills at least 15 at Afghan wedding A rocket fired during fighting between Afghan forces and insurgents has killed at least 15 guests at a wedding in Afghanistan's southern Helmand province. Dozens of others have been wounded. The rocket was assumed to have been fired amid fighting between Afghan Taliban insurgents and the army, which has been battling insurgents in the six months since US forces withdrew from the area. \"At least 15 people were killed and 45 wounded when the rocket struck in a firefight between Afghan security forces and the Taliban,\" said Fareed Ahmad Obaid, police spokesman for Helmand province, earlier Wednesday. Karem Atal, head of Helmand's provincial council, confirmed the incident and said the death toll could increase as many of the wounded were rushed to the hospital. The Associated Press put the death toll higher, saying at least 26 had been killed and that the number could go up to 30. Civilian casualties high in 2014 According to the United Nations, nearly 10,000 civilians and 5,000 soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan this year, 75 percent of them in attacks by the Taliban. Afghanistan's counterterrorism forces have faced a tough challenge in the run-up to the withdrawal of NATO's International Security Assistance Force in January. Afghan security forces will mark the transfer of responsibility from NATO on Thursday. The NATO mission will be reduced to 12,500 troops in 2015, with another 17,000 staying on to assist local police and the army. mg/cmk (AP, Reuters)",

"story": "Learning to respect wild animals again  That bear or kangaroo might look cute, but it's a wild animal, not a pet. Wildlife veterinarian Dr Jan Schmidt-Burbach spoke to DW about the need for humans to learn to respect that most basic rule of nature. In the 1969 movie Kes, a young English teenager called Billy Casper learns the craft of falconry so he can train a wild kestrel. In one scene, he explains why he hates people asking him if his \"pet hawk\" is tame. \"Is it heck tame! Hawks can't be tamed,\" he says in exasperation. \"It's wild and it's fierce and it's not bothered about anybody.\" Young Billy would surely despair at reports this week from Australia of wild kangaroos being fed junk food by tourists. In recent years, there have been regular reports of inappropriate feeding and other ill-advised behavior by tourists around wild animals in various parts of the world. Dr Jan Schmidt-Burbach is a wildlife veterinarian who has worked for the international non-profit animal welfare organization World Animal Protection for more than 10 years. He spoke to Global Ideas about his concerns with the way in which humans interact with wild animals in the smartphone age. *** Global Ideas: We regularly read stories about difficult interactions between humans and wild animals, often to do with unwise feeding or tourist activity. How big a problem are such interactions? Dr Jan Schmidt-Burbach: These instances happen really quite regularly and only the ones that are captured on camera make it into the media. These interactions can lead to injuries or diseases and can trigger problematic behavior in animals that then poses a health and safety risk for people. With the feeding, there are some very particular problems. First of all, the food that is provided by people to animals is often not adequate for the wild animals. Wild animals have very specific dietary needs and they are usually quite capable of finding food themselves. What people believe they want to eat often tends to be junk food and can be toxic, poisonous and can cause harm to the animals. Food with high sugar content has been proven to lead to some form of addiction. So if the animals don't get that food for a while, they tend to become very aggressive and to not be able to source their normal food as well as before. The whole thing about people feeding them is that it changes the behavior of the animal. With the example of a dolphin or with kangaroos, as soon as you feed them, you make them associate humans with food. So the wild animal that normally stays away from the human will be more likely to go to them. Sometimes this can be really dangerous because people don't know how to deal with that. Also, there is the issue of people feeding animals from vehicles. People drive into a national park and they throw some food out of the windows. That is problematic because the animals start associating vehicles with the food. So they tend to gather around the roads more often and that leads to more accidents. Has the problem gotten worse with the advent of the smartphone and all that goes with that, such as selfie sticks, social media narcissism and so on? I don't have any study to back this up but my personal feeling is that it has definitely increased. The intent of people to take selfies or videos of themselves and the attraction of posting a picture with a wild animal on a social media platform has increased the problem. People take all sorts of risks or unnecessary actions to get that picture. That is very problematic. Even aggressive behavior is sometimes felt as being really funny and \"cute\u201d so people trigger those behaviors in animals, just to get the footage. People don't understand anymore that these are wild animals and they don't understand that they have a natural fear of people that is healthy for both animals and people. We live in an age where many wild animals are endangered. Are there real conservation concerns over the way humans misguidedly attempt to feed or take pictures with animals? Yes, there definitely is. You change behavior in these animals and you could possibly introduce diseases into a healthy wild animal population by having people interacting but you also change behavior in that they become less autonomous in sourcing their own food. They stick around communities and settlements more. Then you trigger human-wildlife conflict situations. Human-wildlife conflict situations lead to a backlash against wild animals. In general, people have forgotten how to deal with wild animals in their environment. Take the example of wolves that are now returning to Western Europe. It is something that people have no natural reaction to anymore and don't know how to manage. What's the solution? Having worked so closely with wild animals, do you think human beings have a basic lack of respect for them? Do we need to be educated in order to reevaluate our relationship with wild animals? I think respect is the biggest issue here. People see wild animals as a commodity or as a funny background for a picture but they have lost that understanding that these are complex animals that need to live in the wild on their own terms. Bringing that back is very important. We see that tourists engage in all sorts of wildlife interactions, be it petting a tiger in an enclosure or riding elephants. They don't understand what it means to the animal that is being kept in the cage or in chains all the time. People are attracted to wild animals but we need to use that interest as a vessel to educate people to respect those wild animals for what they are - wild animals and not a commodity or a backdrop. There are many types of wild animals living in European habitats such as foxes, badgers and squirrels that are perhaps not as dangerous as those in other parts of the world, but does the same logic still apply? The same thing applies. Squirrels are a good example but also seagulls and deer. Feeding these animals in the wild can lead to problematic behavior and the same issues that apply to macaques and kangaroos. A squirrel may not injure you as badly as a kangaroo but it can still bite you or become a nuisance so people tend to react to it or try to kill them. In Europe, the bear issue is important as well. In North America, people in national parks have had huge issues for many years with bears raiding camping grounds because they have gotten used to the foods that people carry with them. I think this is very applicable to pretty much all species anywhere in the world. It sounds as though the best advice for humans is to simply leave wild animals alone? Absolutely. That is exactly what we recommend. We recommend people to avoid any direct interaction. Observe wild animals in a responsible way without intruding on them and to leave wild animals in the wild, where they belong. This interview was conducted by Arthur Sullivan, and was edited and condensed for clarity.",

"story": "China may not be the EU's answer to US protectionism There is currently tension in the triangle of globalization powerhouses as the EU, US and China try to maintain cooperative growth amid US protectionism and Chinese ambition. Healthy competition hangs in the balance. At the G20 finance ministers meeting in Germany on Friday, March 17, finance ministers from the world's largest economies were struggling to find consensus on free trade and protectionism for their final communiqu\u00e9 due to be released Saturday. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble told reporters that \"It's possible that we explicitly exclude the topic of trade in Baden-Baden and say that can only be resolved at the summit of the state and government leaders.\" And in a phone conversation on Thursday, German Chancellor Angela Markel and Chinese President Xi Jinping, both expressed concern about the direction of US trade policy. Last year, China surpassed the US as Germany's largest trading partner. The uncertainty at the G20 and the handshaking between Berlin and Beijing are in response to an anticipated US turn to protectionism under President Donald Trump's \"America First\" economic rhetoric and statements from Trump threatening import duties on Chinese and German goods. In February, Reuters reported that the EU was preparing an \"early\" summit in April or May with China to \"promote free trade and international cooperation\" in the face of protectionism from Washington. The report suggests that China wants to reemphasize President Xi Jinping's performance at the World Economic Forum in Davos where he championed China as a bastion of globalization. But behind diplomatic assurances of cooperation and open markets between China and the EU vis \u00e1 vis a new tone in Washington, the US and the EU share concerns that if China becomes the leader in key global industries, they will able to form their own protectionist policies and cut out western companies in favor of domestic enterprises. A great wall of innovation The EU Chamber of Commerce in China recently released a report criticizing Beijing's plan \"Made in China 2025,\" which calls for a giant increase in Chinese domestic production in key industries like transportation, robotics and renewable energy. They argue that eventually China will be able to discriminate against foreign companies, or pressure foreign businesses to give up technology in return for near-term market access. Unlike in the EU and US, China is more able to manipulate its domestic market with government subsidies of preferred companies instead of allowing market competition to determine which enterprises succeed. European and American companies would find it hard to compete with government-supported Chinese firms. \"A decision to continue to use industrial policy to set market share targets for both China's domestic and international markets instead of allowing the market to determine who wins would come at Europe's expense,\" Lance Noble, policy and communications manager at the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, told DW. \"If they are allowed to compete on an even playing field, European firms with advanced knowhow and products can make an important contribution to this process,\" added Noble. Mirjam Meissner, head of the economy and technology program at the Berlin-based Mercator Institute of China Studies (MERICS) told DW that, in general, China wouldn't grow at Europe's expense, but that government intervention in industries would lead to market conditions that discriminate against foreign companies on the Chinese market. \"In those sectors that have been identified by the Chinese government as strategic industries, this potentially leads to a painful decrease of market share for European companies within a few years,\" said Meissner. Growth is good China's aim to liberalize its markets and become a global innovator is a positive thing for the global economy, but for observers, the question remains how they go about growing key industries at the will of market mechanisms free of government subsidies. \"Government intervention in the market and state steering of investment, both in China and Europe, is an integral part of the 2025 initiative,\" said Noble. \"Unfortunately, governments are not well placed to pick winners or to determine which industries will drive future development.\" But there are many indications that China is developing a large number of dynamic and innovative companies using a less direct form of government intervention. \"While the 'old' model of creating markets with the help of massive government funding still exists and poses a certain risk for the success of the strategy, the methods of government intervention have become subtler and more diversified in the past few years,\" said Meissner, adding that the government would use a \"fine-tuned\" system of policy measures to steer the economy and market players into the direction it is aiming at. The eagle and the dragon In the US, a report recently released by the Washington-based technology and innovation think tank, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) took a much more direct tone regarding Chinese industrial ambitions under Made in China 2025 than the EU report. The report stated clearly that Chinese \"mercantilism\" was a direct threat to the US economy and the global trading system. Robert Atkinson, economist and president of the ITIF, told DW that the US would need to work with allies in the EU to \"constructively push back\" against Chinese \"innovation mercantilism.\" \"The United States will have to lead this coalition but European nations will have to be willing to participate and not sit on the sidelines in the hope that the US plays the role of 'bad cop' while they sit back and enjoy 'good' relations with China,\" said Atkinson. \"Chinese firms are heavily dependent on government support, and taking advantage of foreign firms, in developing local champions in these sectors,\" added Atkinson. \"No doubt there are pockets of genuine innovation and competitiveness in some high-tech sectors in China, but the vast majority of the activity we see happening in these high-tech sectors is driven by the government, which leads to ineffective policies and wasteful spending.\" \"If the Chinese government wanted to significantly curb its innovation mercantilist policies and actions it could easily do so. They simply chose not to do so because they want to gain global market share in advanced industries,\" said Atkinson. Can everyone work together? The balance between the world's three economic powerhouses is in a state of continual flux as each player tries to gain influence, maintain dominance or ensure stability. Whether the EU or the US constructively participate in China's growth and increasing gravity in a globalized economy depends on identifying common goals and common outcomes, which can benefit enterprise while being politically palatable for each region. \"China will improve economic governance and transparency, but its understanding of both substantially differs from what we would assume in Europe,\" said Meissner at MERICS. \"We should not expect China to turn into a liberal market economy based on our standards of economic governance and transparency.

"story": "US Blog That Holds Government Responsible Wins Weblog Award From pushing people to live for the moment to protecting bears, from bicycle activism to holding politicians accountable, the 2006 Best of the Blogs Weblog awards (BOBs) showed the variety of the blogosphere. For the first time in the three-year history of Deutsche Welle's Best of the Blogs awards, an American blog, the Sunlight Foundation, received the competition's Best Weblog honors. PaidContent.org received the award for Best English Weblog. \"The Sunlight Foundation blog is a group of people who are not only writing about transparency in American politics, they are helping motivate their audience to uncover wrongdoing and shine a light on how the US Congress operates,\" said US jury member Mark Glaser. \"Not only are they fighting corruption, but they are also creating tools so that average citizens can become watchdogs on their own.\" Recently the group's \"Is Congress a Family Business?\" project uncovered 19 members of the US Congress who paid their spouses a total of $636,000 (495,250 euros) in 2006. Blog encourages involvement in politics \"The winning blog pushes for active public involvement across party lines and takes an exemplary stand for democracy in the blogosphere,\" said Uta Thofern, editor-in-chief of DW-WORLD.DE, Deutsche Welle's Internet presence. \"The group also pulled off one of the coups of the American blogosphere this year by bringing together liberal and conservative bloggers in its 'Exposing Earmarks' project,\" Glaser said, adding that the project exposed 1,800 cases of hidden funding in a legislative bill and led to a new transparency law in the United States. Weblogs of all types, including a Russian blog focused on fighting corruption in soccer and another by a Dutch journalist in Belgrade, were also named winners in the competition's 15 categories and 10 languages. Two Persian blogs share Reporters Without Borders award The Reporters Without Borders Award, which has become an integral part of the BOBS, was shared by two Persian-language bloggers. \"The pair of Iranian winners defends free expression in a country that extensively censors the Internet and jails bloggers who are too critical of its government,\" said jury member Julien Pain of Reporters Without Borders. The first blog, \"Kosoof,\" is a photoblog that proves that pictures sometimes do more for freedom of expression than words by publishing photos of Iranian dissidents with their families after release from prison. The second, \"Tanine Sokut\" by Hamed Mottaghi, denounces human rights violations in Iran and reports on issues that aren't covered by the national media. PaidContent.org best English blog The Jury Award for the best English-language Weblog in 2006 was given to paidContent.org. The jury said it respected the blog's ability to move quickly in breaking news stories and commenting on developments in the digital media industry. \"If only all industries were covered as exhaustively as Paidcontent.org covers for-profit media,\" said US jury member Lisa Stone. \"Nobody -- no newspaper, program or Web site, indeed few analysts -- covers the space as well as the paidContent.org team.\" Awards ceremony in Berlin All of the BOBs awards were announced at an awards ceremony Saturday in Berlin. The BOBs' jury of bloggers, independent journalists and media experts engaged with the audience in a discussion about trends and development in each language's blogosphere. Over 5,500 blogs and podcasts were submitted to the third annual Best of the Blogs, twice as many as in 2005, and over 100,000 votes were cast online to award a Users' Prize to the public's favorite blog in each of the BOBs' 15 categories. Blogopedia The 2006 Best of the Blogs competition ended when the doors were closed Saturday night at Berlin's Museum for Communication, where the ceremony was held, but the Blogopedia, the Deutsche Welle's Weblog catalog, is still open for suggestions for next year's contest as well as to provide a source for unique and interesting blogs to promote themselves. Whether the blogs lists 1,000 ways to open a beer bottle or contains the daily thoughts of Iran's former vice president, the Blogopedia has something you'll want to start reading. The Blogopedia also makes it possible to search for blogs and podcasts according to type, topic and language and then rate and comment on what you find.",

"story": "SPD denies 'green light' for new German government, but keeps options open Social Democratic Party leader Martin Schulz has refuted reports that his party was ready to start coalition talks with Chancellor Merkel's conservatives. But he stopped short of a categorical no.  A visibly irritated Social Democratic chairman Martin Schulz took to the podium in Berlin on Friday to deny that his party was ready to officially begin talks with conservatives toward forming a new grand coalition government. \"I can completely repudiate the rumor that any green light has been given,\" Schulz said. \"It is simply false and unacceptable. The way that erroneous reports are circulated destroys trust.\" Schulz's statement came the day after he met with conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel, Bavarian conservative leader Horst Seehofer and German President Frank Walter Steinmeier to discuss the possibilities for a new German government. Germany's Bild newspaper and the news agencies Reuters and DPA reported earlier on Friday that a deal had been reached to pursue the grand coalition option. Read more: AnotherMerkel-led grand coalition in Germany: What you need to know Schulz said reports to that effect were the result of leaks from the conservative sources, adding that he had called Merkel to complain about the confidentiality of Thursday's meeting being violated. At the same time, he didn't slam any doors on the eventuality that Germany's two largest parties could form another new partnership. \"There was a broad consensus about not closing down any options concerning the formation of a new government,\" Schulz told reporters. Earlier on Friday, SPD politicians said they would not be rushed into joining a new grand coalition. Speaking after Schulz's statement, CDU chief executive Klaus Sch\u00fcler said his party respected what the SPD chairman had to say and would wait for the Social Democrats to make a decision about whether to officially pursue talks. Lots of opposition to talks within the SPD The unusually testy tone Schulz struck is a reflection of the differences between conservatives and Social Democrats not just over the policies of a possible grand coalition, but whether even to try to form one at all. Merkel would have few problems getting her parliamentary group to go along with talks about extending their current collaboration with the Social Democrats, as there is broad consensus among conservatives that a grand coalition is the only way forward. But for the SPD the situation isn't nearly as clear. On September 24, the Social Democrats under Schulz took only 20.5 percent of the vote. It was their worst-ever election performance in post-war German history, and many Social Democrats blamed the compromises the party made as part of the grand coalition that has governed Germany for the past four years. Opinion surveys suggest that the SPD rank-and-file have decidedly mixed feeling about a new edition of the grand coalition, and the party's youth organization, the Jusos, are dead set against it. By contrast, Steinmeier \u2014 himself a former SPD leader \u2014 is known to favor the grand coalition option. Schulz said the SPD executive committee would continue to discuss the party's options next week. He added that all alternatives would be left on the table at the Social Democrats' party conference from December 7 to 9 in Berlin. A renewal of the grand coalition that currently forms the caretaker government emerged as the most likely path to a new German government after the Free Democrats (FDP) withdrew from talks about forming a three-way coalition with conservatives and the Greens. The other options would be for the conservatives to form a minority government or for Germany to hold a snap election. But both are considered extremely problematic.",

"story": "French Companies Merge to Create New European Energy Giant French President Sarkozy has successfully negotiated the merger of Paris-based Suez group and state-controlled Gaz de France, which was announced Monday. GDF-Suez will become one of Europe's biggest energy conglomerates. French President Nicolas Sarkozy brokered terms of the deal, which the companies' boards agreed to late Sunday. The new company, called GDF-Suez, will become one of Europe's largest energy conglomerates along with Russia's state-run Gazprom, Electricite de France and Germany's EON. The two companies have a combined market value of 90 billion euros ($122.8 billion) although Suez will spin off many of its environmental assets, valued by analysts at 18-20 billion euros. Merger of equals The merger was first conceived 18 months ago, but was delayed by disagreements over valuation and control. The final agreement will include a share exchange ratio of 0.9545 to 1, or 21 Gaz de France shares for 22 Suez shares, the groups said in a joint statement. Sarkozy, who was elected in May and has promised economic reforms, pressured Suez to abandon most of its water and waste assets to focus on energy. Besides distributing gas and electricity, Suez runs power stations, pumps water and manages waste. Under terms of the deal, Suez will divest 65 percent of its environmental activities through a stock market listing, scheduled to take place at the same time as the merger. Unions oppose privatization Sarkozy pushed for the merger to prevent a foreign takeover of Suez and to strengthen Gaz de France's power assets. The deal is the latest version of a plan first announced by former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in early 2006 to protect Suez from a possible takeover by Italy's Enel. France's unions and the Socialists have opposed the merger because it would remove the government's control over Gaz de France. The government owns 80 percent of Gaz de France. Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said the government will keep significantly more than a blocking minority of 35 percent. The combined group will be led by Suez Chief Executive Officer Gerard Mestrallet with the state-owned gas utility's Jean-Francois Cirelli becoming the vice chairman. The merged company has set a cost savings target of 1 billion euros by 2013, according to Bloomberg news service. The transaction to create GDF Suez will be completed \"as early as possible\" in 2008, the companies said in a statement. \"Recent developments in the energy sector reinforced the strategic and industrial logic behind the transaction,\" which creates a \"global energy leader,\" the two companies said.",

"story": "Flu-Like Disease Has European Business on Edge European trade fair organizers, tourism companies brace for economic impact as SARS disease death toll rises. The phones have been ringing off the hook at travel offices run by the German company Rewe. Ever since the first reports of deaths in Southwest Asia and Canada linked to the flu-like disease SARS in Februrary, Rewe travel offices and company spokesmen have been seeking to calm harried would-be tourists. Company spokeswoman Antje G\u00fcnther said there have been some cancellations and re-bookings but many more questions. \"We don't want to give any predictions,\" G\u00fcnther, a spokeswoman for the trading company's tourism wing. \"It's something we need to measure day to day, week to week. The sickness isn't simple. You can't say it will be cured tomorrow and then Monday everything will be back to normal.\" Scientists from the World Health Organization travelled to Hong Kong on Thursday to determine the origin and cause of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). So far, the disease has killed 80 people and infected more than 2,300 people in 18 different countries, including a 72-year-old German man who was reported on Thursday to be in stable condition. As Europe braces for a potentially devastating economic impact, everyone from soccer teams to trade fair organizers are on edge. Trade fair bars Asian exhibitors Switzerland's health authorities have barred around 400 Asian exhibitors from a watch and jewelry trade fair that opened in Basel on Thursday. A spokesman for Germany's international Hanover Fair, which begins on Monday, April 7, says it has no plans to do the same. \"We survive on our worldliness, and just because there's some sort of flu in Asia, that doesn't mean we're going to bar the Asians from Hanover,\" Eberhard Roloff, the Hanover Fair's spokesman, told DW-WORLD. Roloff said the Fair has had no cancellations from Asian exhibitors. In fact, the number of exhibitors from Asian countries has increased from 409 last year to 565 in 2003. \"Unpredictable\" sickness keeps visitors away Visitors to Asian countries, however, have begun rethinking their trips. The Everton soccer club, of England's Premier League, is mulling whether or not to cancel a two-game tour in China planned for May 25-26. Ditto for cycling's governing body, the UCI. The body is talking with International Olympic Committee on whether to cancel the for August planned track championships in the southern China province of Shenzhen. The Goethe Insitut, Germany's cultural outreach organization, has put staffers in Asia on high alert but has yet to pull anyone out. The German Foreign Office has posted travel warnings to Germans heading to Hong Kong and the southwest Guandong province. The warnings, added to already in-place warnings to Northern Africa and the Middle East, are likely to further dampen a travel industry that's already suffered by the outbreak of war in Iraq. Dutch airline KLM said this week that SARS has had a more dramatic effect on its passenger count than the Iraq war. A spokesman said that in particular business passengers have cancelled trips because of fears surrounding the virus. German flagship airline Lufthansa said it was grounding additional planes rather than face the possiblity of running empty flights to Asia. G\u00fcnther is concerned the SARS scare could do more damage to the entire travel industry than Iraq ever could. \"The war in Iraq was predictable and in some way measurable,\" G\u00fcnther said in an interview with DW-WORLD. \"This came as a complete surprise and nobody knows how long it's going to continue and how much it will spread.\"",

"story": "Report: German MPs advised not to visit Turkey Germany's Foreign Ministry has advised lawmakers with a Turkish background to avoid going to Turkey in the near future. Politicians of Turkish origin are facing a backlash over a Bundestag vote on the Armenian genocide. An internal assessment from the German Foreign Office said the safety of parliamentarians traveling to Turkey could not be guaranteed, news magazine \"Der Spiegel\" reported on Saturday. The warning followed Ankara's angry reaction to the Bundestag's adoption of an Armenian genocide resolution last week. Germany is the 26th country to recognize the massacre of up to 1.5 million Armenians at the hands of Ottoman forces in 1915-16 as genocide. Turkey rejects the term genocide and insists the Ottoman Empire had no plans to deliberately eliminate the Armenian minority. Following the vote, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan lashed out at the 11 politicians of Turkish descent from the CDU, SPD, Greens and the Left party who had backed the motion. He accused them of siding with the outlawed Kurdish militant PKK and suggested their blood was \"tainted.\" Threats to safety Green Party co-leader Cem \u00d6zdemir, who spearheaded the vote, has reported receiving dozens of death threats from Turkish nationalists. He is under police protection and has boosted security around his Berlin home. \"Der Spiegel\" said a number of Bundestag officials with Turkish heritage had canceled business trips to Ankara and summer vacation plans on the Bosphorus. Germany's Integration Commissioner Aydan \u00d6zoguz, of the Social Democratic Party, said the developments were unfortunate. \"It is indescribable knowing that it's not possible to fly there at the moment,\" he said. \"Erdogan needs to understand that we are not an extension of Turkey.\" Sevim Dagdelen, a Left party MP, called on the German government to take action. \"Merely issuing a travel warning to us deputies isn't enough,\" she told AFP, adding that the ruling coalition should hit Turkish officials behind attacks on German MPs with an entry ban. nm/bk (AFP, dpa)",

"story": "Germany's fertility rate hits 43-year high But women in Germany are still not having enough babies to ensure the total population stays constant. The new figures do however put Germany near the European average. Germany in 2016 recorded its highest fertility rate since 1973, the Federal Statistics Office reported on Wednesday. The latest figures are part of an upward trend for Germany, Europe's biggest country by population, which has suffered from low birth rates since the 1970s. Read more: Let's talk about overpopulation... What the numbers tell us: The fertility rate \u2014 the average number of births per woman \u2014 was 1.59 in 2016, a considerable increase from 1.5 in 2015. The 2016 rate was the highest recorded since 1973. Experts consider 2.1 to be the level at which the population in a developed country replaces itself with each generation. The fertility rate for women with German citizenship increased from 1.43 in 2015 to 1.46 in 2016. The rate for foreign women increased from 1.95 in 2015 to 2.28 in 2016. Slightly more than 790,000 babies were born. That was around 54,500 more \u2014 a 7 percent increase \u2014 compared to 2015. German women gave birth to just over 605,000 babies. Foreign women gave birth to just below 185,000 babies. 2016 was the fifth year in a row in which the total number of newborns increased. The last time women in Germany had as many children was 1996. Read more: Record rise in babies with foreign mothers in Germany Why are there more babies? The Federal Statistics Office said women between the ages of 30 and 37 were more frequently having children. Many of them did not have children when they were younger, which was in stark contrast to older women, who more frequently had children before they turned 30. Middle of the EU pack: Germany's 1.59 fertility rate put it near the 1.6 average for all 28 European Union countries in 2016. France had the highest rate with 1.92, while Spain and Italy had the lowest with 1.34.

"story": "German Athletes Feel the Pressure of Olympic Gold Swimmer Britta Steffen and gymnast Fabian Hambuechen feel the burden of the whole country as both look to give Germany Olympic gold in glamour sports at the Beijing Games. \"I am torn, everybody has expectations of me which I may not be able to meet,\" the 100m freestyle European record holder Steffen told DPA news agency. Germany's medals for a top placing in the medal table normally come from sports such as canoeing, rowing, fencing, equestrian and shooting - and not so much the big three of athletics, swimming and gymnastics. \"We will hopefully be helped by the sports in which we have traditionally been strong, such as canoeing or riding,\" said German Olympic Committee (DOSB) general director Michael Vesper. Germany came sixth in the Athens 2004 medal table with 13 gold medals, 16 silver and 20 bronze. Its overall score of 49 medals was good enough for joint fourth place with Australia, with the US leading the table with 36-39-27 medals and the overall list with 102 medals. \"We want to achieve a good result, finish at the same level as in our sixth-place finish in Athens, or even move up one position,\" said the DOSB's vice president, Eberhard Gienger. The German team of around 450 athletes also features table tennis ace Timo Boll, who hopes to scare the hosts at their number one sport. Other bright lights Canoeing 2004 champion Andreas Dittmer, dressage star Isabelle Werth, the men's field hockey and handball teams are also major medal hopes. Steffen, meanwhile, rose to stardom with four golds and one silver at the 2006 European championships although she had to settle for a bronze and a silver at the 2007 worlds. Now the 24-year-old is hoping to deliver Germany's first swim gold since 1992, in the 50m or 100m freestyle races. \"I am so scared to finish the 100m in second place and not to be happy with it. I don't even know if I could be happy with gold because that result would only confirm the expectations,\" Steffen said. Hambuechen won world championship gold for Germany on the horizontal bar, all-around silver and team bronze. The diminutive 20-year-old, known as the \"gymnastics professor,\" now hopes to cap his career in Beijing and said he will be not be to the forefront when it comes to criticism of China over human rights and other issues. \"I have a critical view of the political situation in China but at the Olympics in Beijing I will only think about my competition,\" said Hambuechen, the German Sportsman of the Year in 2007.",

"story": "Credit rating agency slaps Italy with negative forecast Standard & Poors has slapped Italy with a negative forecast, raising the prospect that the credit rating of the eurozone's third-largest economy could be slashed. The credit rating agency Standard & Poors has downgraded its forecast for Italy from \"stable\" to \"negative,\" citing a weak economy and poor prospects for reducing Rome's massive debts. The negative forecast implies that there is a one-and-three chance Italy's credit rating could be downgraded within the next 24 months. A downgrade of Rome's credit rating may raise fear among investors that the debt crisis which has gripped Greece, Ireland and Portugal will spread to Italy, the eurozone's third largest economy. \"In our view, Italy's current growth prospects are weak and the political commitment for productivity-enhancing reforms appears to be faltering,\" Standard & Poors said in a statement. \"Potential political gridlock could contribute to fiscal slippage. As a result, we believe Italy's prospects for reducing its general government debt have diminished.\" Italy reacts The Italian Department of the Treasury strongly criticized Standard & Poors, saying that data on its economic growth and public accounts had \"constantly been better than expected.\" The treasury went on to say that major international organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Commission have given \"very different\" assessments of Italy's economy.

"story": "Berlin's art scandals combust spontaneously When a Berlin artist 'vandalizes' his own painting or steals his own sculpture, does it cause a scandal? DW's Berlin insider Jan Kage explores the recipe for artistic provocation in a city known for rebellion. \"Can you please come for Jim's performance tomorrow morning,\" a journalist from television broadcaster Arte asked me after we finished an interview about Berlin artist Jim Avignon, who'd curated a show in my art space and who's been a friend of mine for many years now. \"I need another picture of you in a different setting. It won't take long.\" \"I don't think so,\" I answered honestly. \"We have an opening tonight and tomorrow morning I have to take care of my baby.\" \"Oh, bring her, too! That'd be an awesome picture.\" \"Never! I can't have my little girl on TV. She can decide on that herself later,\" I replied. \"Well, we don't have to show her face. Or we'll just shoot you and have her waiting on the side.\" Sometimes honest answers only prolong things, so I shifted to making vague promises: \"Sure, I'll try my best!\" Repainting the Berlin Wall Jim had planned a scandalous performance for that Saturday morning. He wanted to repaint the piece of the East Side Gallery that he had painted in 1990. The East Side Gallery is the last remaining part of the Berlin Wall. Right after it came down in 1989, a lot of artists painted the two kilometers of Wall between the Ostbahnhof train station and the bridge, Oberbaumbr\u00fccke. Although most of the results were pretty kitschy, they all carried the spirit of those days marking the end of the Cold War. A couple of nice ones are to be found as well of course - like Jim's and Thierry Noire's, for example. They both come from West Berlin's 80s scene and made a name for themselves as new pop artists in the 90s. Back then, Jim decorated a whole lot of techno parties in their illegally squatted venues. Posters and cardboard installations were quickly drawn and cheaply installed. It was art for the here-and-now that you could dance within, and in the morning when the party was over you could take it home with you. Jim had this philosophy of \"better a thousand pictures for one dollar than one for a thousand.\" This popularized his art to the degree that most people in the scene had a piece of his at home. But also to the degree that the market is so flooded with his work that the price will probably never go up. Commenting on the present Back at the East Side Gallery, Jim and his helpers were planning to repaint the strip within just a couple of hours so they wouldn't get caught by the cops. The Gallery is not only a protected monument - a status which is taken very seriously in Germany - but also was renovated four years ago for a million euros so that tourists can forever enjoy the pictures that were painted on it 24 years ago. Jim Avignon didn't like the \"forever\" part of this concept. He had depicted the celebration of East Germany's self-liberation in 1989 as a picture of its time, with nitty-gritty politicians showing their teeth and tanks, and opposed to those happy people joyously running towards each other and hugging. Now he wanted to address the state of the city as he finds it today: failed investments and speculations on the house market, gentrification, and the like. But Jim's blatant repainting proved to be a true scandal, especially with the other artists. They felt provoked and feared that everybody could now paint on the Wall whenever they wanted. Another outcry concerning the East Side Gallery happened earlier this year when an investor had pieces of the Wall temporarily removed so trucks could enter his construction site, where he's building a fancy apartment complex. People didn't like both the expensive apartment and the removal of parts of the Wall. French street artist JR was in town at the time, working on the Berlin edition of his \"Wrinkles of the City\" project and responded by putting up wooden boards into the hole in the Wall, gluing posters with his photography onto it. The newspapers reported intensively on this - especially since one of the security guards got attacked that same night. But that must have been other people - not JR and his crew. \"What do you think about Jim repainting the Wall?\" the Arte journalist asked me. \"Why not? I don't see why the paintings that were once drawn should be preserved forever.\" I said. \"Art in the streets is bound to vanish. Also, most of the painters were not the best - or best-known - artists in the first place. They were just people who took the chance to paint it right after the Wall came down, which is great. But nobody promotes the idea of preserving the graffiti that was on the west side of the Wall either. So, I guess things change.\" 'Stolen' art Repainting his work was not Jim's first illegal action when it comes to presenting his art in public. Twelve years ago, a local tabloid asked Jim to paint one of the Buddy Bears - a rather kitschy series of hundreds of bear sculptures positioned in public spaces all over town. A bear is part of the city's coat of arms and it's a kind of local mascot. Jim hesitated because he didn't love the sculpture, but since it was for charity reasons and the paper promised to take it off Kurf\u00fcrstendamm (one of Berlin's most famous boulevards) after six months to auction it off for a good cause, he agreed to paint one. Six months and three weeks later, however, the bear was still standing in the street, so Jim called the paper. The editor he spoke to was kind of ambiguous. He told Jim the same thing the TV journalist told me when I was not sure I'd make it to the performance: \"But that's good promotion for you!\" Jim didn't buy that answer. Instead, he rented a van and drove to the bear at night with a couple of friends and some screwdrivers. They unscrewed the sculpture, heaved it into the van, and took the bear to a place where he could \"hibernate\" for the winter. Suddenly, the tabloid was alarmed. \"Jim Avignon's Bear Stolen,\" the headlines read. They went looking around for it, but the bear was nowhere to be found. And it stayed in hiding for a whole decade. Rebirth of a non-scandalous bear Jim's bear was finally resurrected for last year's Art Village, which is the art space I curate during the annual Berlin Festival music event. We rented a van and brought the bear back to the city. Then we put him on top of the five containers that served as the entrance to the Art Village at old, historic Tempelhof Airport. That was around the same time that the three members of the Russian band Pussy Riot were on trial in Moscow for their political dissidence. The case was a shock to all of us who grew up with punk rock and egalitarian ideals - but also stimulating to learn that one can still provoke the powers that be with a punky performance. So as a sign of solidarity and deference, we had an old lady crochet a bright yellow Pussy Riot ski mask for the bear's head. Unfortunately neither the bringing back of the bear nor the ski mask produced any kind of tabloid scandal. But it sure was loved by everybody who saw it. And that proves one point: You can't really plan a scandal. They just happen, depending on how relevant the topic is at the moment and how spot-on the timing is. And there may be two or three other parameters involved that I'm still investigating so that maybe I can plan the next one myself after all.",

"story": "South Korea latest US ally to join AIIB Washington looks increasingly isolated as another important ally joins the China-backed Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). Australia and Taiwan could be next, as a deadline for founding members approaches. Shares in South Korean iron and steel companies shot up after Seoul announced Thursday it would seek to join the controversial Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). Histeel and Hanil Iron and Steel are likely to benefit from contracts when the China-backed bank begins pumping billions into infrastructure projects in the region later this year. A South Korean finance ministry official said companies in the communications, energy and transport companies would also gain contracts. South Korea is the latest in a growing list of countries who are accepting Beijing's invitation to become founding members of the AIIB before a March 31 deadline. But it is also one of the United States' closest allies in Asia, and Washington opposes the AIIB because it believes it will undercut the World Bank, where it dominates policy. Japan, which together with the US controls another Asian development lender, the Asian Development Bank, is still holding out. Strained relations Also in the region, Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou said on Friday his country should investigate opportunities in joining the bank, in spite of its strained relations with Beijing. Britain, another key ally of Washington, became the first EU country agreeing to join the AIIB two weeks ago. Since then, other European governments have been lining up to get in on the action. France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland have agreed. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has also hinted his country will join the more than 30 nations so-far agreeing to take part in the AIIB, which includes India and all members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). kc/uhe (dpa, AP)",

"story": "Kurdish YPG, Assad regime clash in Hasakeh The Kurdish YPG militia has launched a bid to take Hasakeh after calling on pro-government militias to surrender. Fighting over the divided city marks the most violent confrontation between the YPG and Syrian regime yet. Kurdish militia launched a major assault Monday to capture the entire city of Hasakeh and called on remaining pro-government forces to surrender. The fighting appears to have undone tacit understandings between the YPG and the Syrian army that had kept Hasakeh relatively calm during the past five-year conflict. The Syrian air force attacked the armed Kurdish group for the first time during the war last week, prompting the US-led military coalition to scramble aircraft to protect American special forces troops deployed alongside the YPG. US Navy Captain Jeff Davis warned Damascus that the US-led coalition would do what was needed to protect its forces on the ground. \"The Syrian regime would be well advised not to do things that would place them at risk,\" Davis said Friday. Syrian state media accuses the YPG-affiliated security force known as the Asayish of violating a ceasefire. That was denied in a leafleting campaign that said the YPG intended to take control. \"To all the elements of the regime and its militias who are besieged in the city you are targeted by our units,\" the leaflets read. The loss of Hasakeh would be a strategic blow to President Bashar Assad's government and would be a setback for Russia, which has given air support to Assad's forces to prevent further territorial losses in the country. Thousands of civilians in the city, which is a mix of Arabs and Kurds, including members of the Christian community, have fled to villages in the countryside as the fighting intensified, residents said. Fighting around Hasakeh has killed 43 people including 27 civilians, among them 11 children, since Wednesday, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Thousands of civilians have now fled Hasakeh, where electricity has been cut and bakeries shut. jar/rc (Reuters, AFP, AP)",

"story": "The search for the last Nazi henchmen It's a race against time: Germany's Central Office for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes is looking for more than 50 former concentration camp guards. Even 70 years later, it could still secure convictions. Hans Lipschis lives in a small placid village in southern Germany. The 93-year-old with thick, horn-rimmed glasses does not like to talk about his past, but investigators believe he may have participated in unspeakable atrocities during World War II. Lipschis worked at the Auschwitz concentration camp between 1941 and 1945, possibly as a guard, and so may have been jointly responsible for thousands of deaths. Lipschis himself says he was only a cook, and had nothing to do with the murders. Over 50 former concentration camp guards are thought to be still alive, according to Germany's Central Office for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes, and preliminary investigations are to be initiated against all of them. Kurt Schrimm, director of the office, says that investigators have been working on the case against Lipschis for some time, and they cannot give out further details on it because the file has been handed in to state prosecutors in Stuttgart. The office had already brought a case against Lipschis in the 1980s, but the charge of murder could not be proven. If the case comes to trial now, it will be the first time that a suspected concentration camp guard has faced justice since John Demjanjuk. New verdict The trial against Demjanjuk, who worked at the Sobibor death camp, is now seen as a legal turning point. It marked the first time that a non-German subordinate to the National Socialists was sent to court without proof of the defendant having committed any concrete wrongdoing. Nevertheless, a Munich court convicted the Ukrainian in 2011 for complicity in the murder of over 28,000 people. Proof that Demjanjuk had worked as a guard in the camp was enough for the prosecution to win the conviction. In the event, Demjanjuk did not serve his five-year sentence - he appealed, and died before a federal court could confirm the verdict. Now the Office for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes wants to use that legal precedent to convict other guards, dozens of whom are thought to be still living in Germany. \"We are now working on the assumption that you no longer have to prove that a guard - so, a helper - was involved in the individual murders of one or more prisoners. You simply have to prove that his activities in a death camp helped the entire machinery of death there to function,\" said Schrimm. 'Ridiculous' judiciary But the search for individual henchmen is complicated and laborious. Schrimm's investigators have to sift through archives and old trial records. The office even searches for evidence such as travel documents in Eastern Europe and South America, since Nazi criminals often travelled with International Red Cross papers to escape justice. Not only that, but the office is pressed for time, for many of the suspects are extremely old, making a conviction unlikely. That is why journalist Beate Klarsfeld, who earned a reputation as a \"Nazi hunter\" in post-war Germany, is critical of the new investigations. \"It is making the judiciary ridiculous, because it had the chance to hold good trials,\" she said, adding that she believes it is more important to use memorials to maintain the memory of the crimes committed. Klarsfeld earned fame in 1968 when she slapped West German Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger, a former member of the Nazi party, at a Christian Democratic Union conference and called him to step down as she was escorted away. Remembering the dead But for the relatives of those that died in the concentration camps, the investigations still carry moral weight. \"Justice is of great value, and if the prosecutors now see a chance to bring Lipschis to court, then they should and must do that,\" says Christoph Heubner, vice president of the International Auschwitz Committee. \"The atrocities of Auschwitz do not have a statute of limitations, and those of the camps don't either.\" He dismisses the argument that the perpetrators are too old to stand trial as \"cynical.\" \"No one cared about the age of the children taken to the ovens either,\" he told DW. Kurt Gutmann, a co-plaintiff in the Demjanjuk trial, agrees. \"It brings some satisfaction to live to see something being done, so that the dead aren't forgotten, that someone is still after the criminals even in their old age.\" But as yet it remains unclear if and when Lipschis will stand trial.",

"story": "'Dear Evan Hansen' takes home most statuettes at 71st Tony Awards More unpredictable than in recent years with many strong contenders vying for the theater prizes, Kevin Spacey, who won a Tony himself, hosted the awards show. \"Dear Evan Hansen\" did well. What started as an open field for theater's biggest night became Evan Hansen's big celebration. \"Dear Evan Hansen\" took home six statuettes at Sunday night's Tony Awards, including best musical. The show depicts a lonely teenager, Evan Hansen, who makes up a previous friendship with a classmate who just committed suicide. Hansen eventually gains the family's acceptance until the truth is discovered. Song writers Benj Pasek and Justin Paul won best original score for their work on the musical. Pasek and Paul also won an Oscar earlier this year for writing the lyrics to film musical \"La La Land.\" Ben Platt, who plays the anxious Hansen, won best performance by an actor in a leading role in a musical. Platt also starred in the \"Pitch Perfect\" movies and \"The Book of Mormon.\" Oslo best play \"Oslo\" won the best play award. The play goes through the 1993 meetings between Israeli and Palestinian diplomats, which led to the Oslo Accords and handshake between Israel Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Chairman Yasser Arafat. Actor Michael Aronov won the Tony for best actor in a featured role in the play. \"Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812\" had 12 nominations, which was more than any other Broadway production. It came away with two Tony awards for best set and lighting. Dolly may never go away again The classic \"Hello, Dolly!\" came back to Broadway to thunderous applause. The musical won four Tonys, including best musical revivla and Bette Midler taking home her first statuette as best actress in a musical. Midler said she had a \"very tough schedule\" but the experience had been \"life-affirming and life-changing.\" \"It's more than I deserve,\" said Midler. Kevin Spacey hosted the show. A two time Oscar winner, Spacey was involved in some of the musical numbers and did impressions. He won a Tony Award in 1991 for his role in \"Lost in Yonkers.\" Spacey currently plays ruthless politician Frank Underwood in the Netflix series \"House of Cards.\" James Earl Jones, most well known for the voice of Darth Vader from the \"Star Wars\" franchise, received a lifetime achievement award. kbd/jm (AP, dpa, Reuters)",

"story": "EU eyes bloc-wide air passenger database EU interior ministers have urged the European Parliament to approve a data sharing system that could be employed to track suspected extremists. France has pushed hard for EU system as debate over privacy continues. As EU interior ministers meet Friday in Brussels, France has renewed its push for a Passenger Name Records (PNR) system for air passengers that could be used to track suspected violent extremists. \"It's very important that we have the Passenger Name Records,\" French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told reporters as he joined colleagues for talks on security. \"Terrorists use intra-European flights, and we have to trace their movements in order to be able to prevent terrorist risks.\" The German government also supports the initiative. \"We could spot early on if dangerous people come to Europe, which routes they take and what their networks are like,\" German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said. Such a measure would require approval from the European Parliament, which for the past two years has debated the privacy implications of a European PNR system similar to ones already in use in the United States, Canada and Australia. But recent attacks in France has helped buoy support among European lawmakers, especially as individual EU members have already begun building their own systems leading to a patchwork of competing systems that critics say could be even more vulnerable to compromise. \"An EU PNR system with robust protections for personal data is far preferable to 28 EU PNR systems and a patchwork of regimes,\" said Timothy Kirkhope, the lead EU lawmaker chaperoning the deal through the European Parliament. \"We are almost there on a deal.\" As currently drafted, the agreement would give law enforcement agencies in the 28 EU nations access to information gathered by airlines, including names, travel dates, itinerary, credit card and contact details. \"We could spot early on if dangerous people come to Europe, which routes they take and what their networks are like,\" German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said. Devil's in the details Yet sticking points remain over how long personal data could be stored in databases. European Parliament, in its latest official position, has insisted identity records be \"masked\" after six months so that officials would only be able to track trends but not individuals. France wants to keep full data for at least a year and is expected to use the recent extremist attacks on its soil to make its case. \"I'm going to work to convince my European colleagues who still have to be convinced of the need to implement what parliament recommends and which would allow a high level of protection,\" Cazeneuve said. For years, Washington has been pushing the EU to adopt a PNR system to tighten security, and US President Barack Obama once again called on the EU to implement it in the wake of the November 13 attacks that left 130 people dead in Paris. An EU-US agreement over the exchange of data has already been reached. The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said that deal offers full data protection but many European parliamentarians were suspicious of its safeguards and repeatedly held up approval. jar/sms (AP, AFP, dpa)",

"story": "French traveling groups block highway after Roma evictions Ethnic Roma and French travelers have staged a protest on a major highway after hundreds were evicted from an illegal site. The French government is cracking down, vowing to close 300 campsites. Members of France's ethnic Roma group and members of the country's native traveler minority blocked a major highway outside Bordeaux on Sunday after being evicted from a campsite near the city. The blockade was the first major protest in the wake of a government crackdown on unauthorized sites across the country. Protesters used cars, trucks and caravans to block the Bordeaux bypass and a bridge over the River Garonne in the southwest of the country. Police and road safety officials said traffic in the direction of Paris was backed up for five kilometers (three miles) on a summer public holiday weekend. The protesters blocked the bridge for some five hours, leaving to try to gain access to a sports ground. They were stopped by riot police and reoccupied the bridge for another hour-and-a-half. Forced to leave site The group of travelers and Roma had been forced to leave a campsite in the nearby town of Anglet, and had been denied access to an exhibition ground by authorities. French President Nicolas Sarkozy last month announced plans to dismantle 300 unauthorized campsites within three months, following a clash between Roma, mainly of Bulgarian and Romanian origin, and police. The raids, being investigated by the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, were met with criticism from committee members at a meeting last week. A lawmaker from Sarkozy's ruling UMP party, Jean-Pierre Grand branded the evictions \"disgraceful\" on Saturday, likening them to roundups of minorities during World War II.

"story": "Court Refuses to Return Seized Art to Nazi Doctor's Relatives A Federal Administration Court in Leipzig has decided the town of Chemnitz does not have to return confiscated art objects to the heirs of a Nazi doctor. The Federal Administrative Court in the city of Leipzig said there were no grounds for the restitution of art which has been confiscated by Soviets after World War Two because the doctor in question had been a promoter of Adolf Hitler's ideology. \"The aim of this function was to spread national socialist ideology,\" said the court in a statement. Hundreds of oil paintings, etchings and drawings were allegedly confiscated from Gustav Schuster, who was Director of the Chemitz Women's Clinic, during the Second World War. The artworks, which include paintings by Ludwig Richter, Max Liebermann and Max Klinger, are worth at least 500,000 euros ($662,550). The decision, had it have been different, could have opened the doors to thousands of other claims for compensation for artworks, property and other goods confiscated from 1945 to 1949 by the Soviet forces which occupied the eastern part of Germany after WWII. As it is, legal experts say the ruling could set a different precedent and negatively affect similar restitution claims that could number into the thousands, according to the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, which quoted an official from the German Finance Ministry. Nazis aren't eligible for compensation The German \"Compensation and Just Satisfaction Act\" law, which was passed in 1994, exempts the state from paying compensation if the person from who the goods were confiscated \"extensively\" supported the Nazi regime, or had committed \"crimes against humanity.\" This can give rise to the problem that heirs are disinclined to probe deeply into their family's background. The S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung reported that the lawyers for Schuster's family have presented the court with documents showing that there were 14,427 senior positions in the Nazi regime at the municipal level. The family argues that as one under thousands, Dr. Schuster therefore was only responsible for 0.006 percent of what occurred. However, according to the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, there is not doubt that Schuster was jointly responsible for deciding on, and conducting, the forced sterilization of dozens of women. The newspaper quotes the example of a similar court decision made in October when the son of a lawyer for the Nazi regime was awarded compensation for two properties confiscated from his family. Only after the court case, was it revealed that the lawyer was probably involved in the hanging of a deserter in the last days of the war.",

"story": "German Financial Experts to Discuss New Technology Index Financial experts at the German Stock Exchange are due to discuss the expansion of the equity market and the implementation of the new TecDAX technology sector index model at a meeting on Tuesday. Experts at the Deutsche B\u00f6rse, the German Stock Exchange, will meet on February 11 in Frankfurt to discuss the final arrangements on the expansion of the country's financial market. While the original DAX index will remain unchanged and continuing to host Germany's 30 largest blue chip companies, the new developments are set to expand the equity market with a new index model that aims to showcase technology companies The model, to be known as TecDAX, is based on a plan that was approved in principle by the Exchange Council of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange last year. Members of Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG, the company that runs the stock exchange, are due to discuss the proposal of introducing the TecDAX to the current market system on Tuesday. If the integration is agreed upon, the new indices will be launched on March 24. TecDAX to showcase technology companies The TecDAX, which will track the 30 largest equities, will offer companies from the technology sectors greater exposure and it is hoped it will contribute to an economic recovery for Germany. Volker Potthoff, the Deutsche B\u00f6rse executive board member responsible for the cash market, said in an official press release: \"The new index completes the new equity market segmentation with which we are creating the highest transparency standards in Europe and thus making investors the focus of market organization.\" Current Nemax index will offer support Once the TecDAX is up and running, a parallel calculation of the Nemax 50, the current index for the 50 largest equities in the technology sectors, is expected to continue until the end of 2004, in order to maintain continuity for financial products already based on this index. While the DAX will be unchanged, Deutsche B\u00f6rse will differentiate between those companies below the DAX. For the companies from classic sectors, it will calculate the MDAX index, a senior index of companies, which is being reduced from 70 to 50 equities. The SDAX will continue to comprise 50 equities as the selection index for smaller firms ranked immediately below the MDAX. Skepticism from financial professionals Professionals from the financial sector are skeptical about the new TecDAX market and its worth. \"I can hardly believe that this new market index sector will bring a real change,\" said Eberhard Weinberger from analysts Dr. Jens Erhard Kapital AG. \"First, you must develop better frameworks in Germany, then that will be the time for big decisions.\" The air of caution may be justified. The B\u00f6rse's New Market, its equivalent of the Nasdaq index, failed to make an impact and lost almost all of its value over a two-and-a-half year period. Germany's stock exchange operator announced the New Market's closure in September 2002 and planned an early 2003 timetable for it to be absorbed into the main market, along with the small-cap SMAX segment.",

"story": "Documenta 12: \"No Meaningless Art From Opportunistic Virtuosos\" Roger M. Buergel, artistic director of Documenta 12, told DW-WORLD.DE in an interview that he rejects \"aesthetic shocks\" of large exhibitions and explains why it is important to him to bring art to the public. DW-WORLD.DE: When you were appointed as artistic director of Documenta 12, you promised an \"easily readable\" show without a massive catalogue, so that the visitors wouldn't be overwhelmed with text. Have you kept your promise? Roger M. Buergel: We have worked very hard to create an exhibition that is tangible and accessible, and there is a small manageable catalogue. Your secrecy over the choice of artists suggests you want to use surprise as a PR strategy. How do you deal with terms like spectacle and event being applied to Documenta? Do you see Documenta as theater which needs to be staged dramatically? No, insofar as I believe that the exhibition should concentrate on its core business. Documenta shouldn't be a film festival, dance festival, art exhibition and science convention. Yes, in the sense that such a mass event does offer opportunities for enthusiastic struggles over social commitments and cultural exchange. I am not announcing a complete list of participating artists before the opening because I don't want to take part in this neurotic game. Scrutinizing the names of the list of artists and anticipating aesthetics shocks affects people's view of the art. It shouldn't be about the individual artists, but about the exhibition as a whole. The works exist within their own context and that's what the visitors should concentrate on. You have selected unknowns over high profile names. Is it really possible to produce a Documenta that exists outside the mainstream art world? In contrast to most big art events, which are very privileged, we are not trying to serve up the filet steak of the art world on silver platters. Of course, we do provide a measure of what is going on in the international art world, but we don't just do that. The holding of a trade fair in parallel to the exhibition, which is happening at the Venice Biennale, I would never allow here. And whether it's Venice, Basel or Miami, many of these events look like they were put together quite swiftly. But art is a very slow process, it can't be made haphazardly. I don't want meaningless art from opportunists, who create a work overnight and who have been doing the same thing for years. For the first time in the history of Documents include antiquities. Why represent the past in the most important international exhibition of contemporary art? One can only understand contemporary art when one knows where it comes from. That makes it possible to see where art is heading in the future. I'm not trying to show what is contemporary, but to illustrate where certain forms come from. Our oldest exhibit is a Persian design from the 14th century, which was produced after an expedition by Persian artists to the Chinese imperial palace. Looking at it, you can see how the Persians were influenced by Chinese forms. I wanted to give a new depth to the exhibition, in order to give the public the chance to understand the context in which contemporary art is situated. And I have a responsibility to the educational role of Documenta. The spatial plan seems to play a very much important role for you. You built new exhibitions spaces in Kassel, in which works of art from different epochs and geographical origin come into contact with one another. Do you want the space to act as mediators between works of art and public? The viewer needs a space in which the works can communicate between themselves, and where the viewer is also a part of this conversation. Creating an exchange like this depends heavily on the presentation of the exhibits. For me, the most import thing about creating exhibition architecture is that the viewers can concentrate on the art. The book \"Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life\" by Giorgio Agamben is at the center of the exhibition. Topics of migration and escape are touched on in that work. In what respect will the relationship between art and politics be present in Documenta 12? It won't be political in the sense of showing videos of child soldiers, but really more in terms of trying to change the attitudes of people who see the exhibition. In that sense it is very political. However, we haven't selected works based on their politics, but rather those that further educate the general public. This Documenta includes a film program with 96 contributions as well as exhibitions in cinema foyers. Has film as an art form been given more attention than in previous Documentas? Even though film is close to our hearts, it is only featured selectively in Documenta 12. We don't want to confine moving pictures to a black box. In our view, film has had its place here ever since the first Documenta -- at the Gloria Cinema. A bored public which has already seen everything is a topic of discussion in the art world. How do you overcome that attitude from viewers, that they have already seen everything? It's not about fascinating people with the strange and unknown, but rather about bringing things that people know nearer to them. We want to remind people to look at things more closely. Documenta 12 opened to the public June 16 and runs until Sept. 23.",

"story": "Opinion: Duterte presidency is a threat to democracy Rodrigo Duterte's victory in the presidential election is a crushing defeat for the country's political establishment and poses a gargantuan challenge for democracy in the Philippines, writes DW's Thomas Latschan. Sometimes politics in the Philippines can be an enigma: Less than two months ago, people were celebrating in the streets of Manila. In late February 2016, hundreds of thousands of Filipinos gathered at the Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, or EDSA for short. They commemorated the overthrow of the Marcos regime exactly 30 years ago, at the precise location, where the masses had revolted against dictatorship and the reign of violence. Today, again, people are celebrating on the streets of the island nation, hailing a 71-year old who calls himself \"the Punisher.\" He is someone who promises to wage a \"bloody war\" on crime and plans to hunt down and kill criminals. He promises easy solutions for the enormous and complex problems plaguing the country, while repeatedly stating that democratic values didn't count for him as long as he would achieve his goals. \"Forget the law and human rights,\" Rodrigo Duterte has shouted to his supporters. According to him, parliament has to be dissolved, if its members stand in his way. He would impose martial law instead and install a \"revolutionary government.\" But how could it come to this? Poverty, corruption and crime At the beginning of the campaign, nobody would have thought Duterte could win. Skillfully, he positioned himself as an outsider of the political establishment. The more blatant his remarks, the bigger the crowd attending his speeches became. Duterte's election victory is a rebuff for the ruling elites in Manila. That's because, in 30 years of democracy, they have failed to solve the biggest problems of the country - widespread poverty, rampant corruption and everyday crime. This failure fueled the people's longing for a strong man, a savior or, if salvation wouldn't come, a \"punisher.\" This outcome must be particularly painful for the outgoing President Benigno Aquino, under whose watch the country experienced rapid economic growth - averaging over six percent. But a majority of the population didn't benefit from the robust expansion. And the progress was too slow for them. At the same time, poverty remains widespread - with over a quarter of the population living on approximately a dollar a day. Aquino made progress in terms of reducing poverty. And World Bank President Jim Yong Kim described his government as the most zealous in fighting corruption. However, this resulted in corruption scandals being now discussed more openly and fervently than before. And it led to rising public anger and frustration at the ruling political class; and this popular disgust was tapped into by \"the punisher.\" In addition, the crime rate in the country has remained high under Aquino, while the judicial system continues to be weak and conviction rates remain low. And even the victims of the atrocities committed during the Marcos-era are still awaiting justice. In a country where the population is on average 23 years old, most people have no recollection of the horrors of the dictatorship. Instead, many have lost their confidence in the rule of law and democracy. Moreover, many young Filipinos - feeling deprived of economic opportunities - yearn for change. Only when seen through this lens can one explain why the people rest their hopes on a man who is even rumored to be working with death squads. It is this amalgam of everyday frustration combined with a lack of awareness of history, which turned an unelectable candidate into a socially acceptable figure. Threat of polarization That's why not all Filipinos are celebrating today, as only a segment of the electorate voted for the hardliner Duterte. The Philippine law allows him to declare victory and become president even though he won just 38 percent of the vote. But the majority is still against him, and the country faces the threat of a polarization of its society. A lot will ultimately depend on who wins the race for vice-president. In that contest, the liberal candidate Leni Robredo is leading her opponent, the son of the former dictator Marcos, by a tiny margin. Should Marcos still win, then two designated autocrats would be leading the country. Nevertheless, the coming years will prove to be a severe test for democracy and the rule of law in the Philippines. Have something to say?

"story": "Germany aims for 1 million e-cars by 2020 Chancellor Angela Merkel has re-affirmed the goal to have one million electrical cars on Germany's roads by 2020. An advocate says this hinges on the right mix of cheap batteries and pricing of electricity versus fuel. A two-day conference on future mobility opened in Berlin on Monday, with a call from German Transport Minister Peter Ramsauer that industry and state work together to create an \"intelligent\" infrastructure for electric vehicles. Among Germany's 43 million registered vehicles, only 7,000 are electric cars, while 65,000 are so-called hybrids which have combined fuel and battery-driven motor units. Sixteen new models are expected next year. To initiate the breakthrough and reach one million by 2020, Ramsauer said urban planning must provide infrastructure such as fast battery recharging stations that fitted in \"intelligently\" with other forms of mobility such as trams. Strife over sockets EU Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas said Europe must still standardize the design of power sockets for re-charging stations. Especially in France, there were doubts about a socket favored in Germany, said Kallas. Merkel told politicians, scientists, automobile industry experts and interest groups that the goal was ambitious, but achievable. She urged Germany's automobile industry to master the transformation process underscored by Germany's 2011 decision to phase out nuclear and fossil fuels in favor of renewables. Acceptance conditional The chairman of Germany's National Electro-mobility Platform Henning Kagermann told German public ZDF television that future e-car acceptance would depend on trends in fuel and electricity pricing and \"how cheap batteries can become.\" Kagermann forecast that so-called e-car sales would accelerate from 2015. Like Chancellor Merkel, he ruled out the use of sales incentives for prospective e-car buyers. The president of the German VDA automobile federation, Matthias Wissman, who is a former conservative cabinet minister, called on Merkel's center-right coalition government to consider tax rebates for future company e-car fleets. The German ADAC automobile club said in a survey it had determined that 47 percent of motorists are not willing to switch to an electric vehicle if it costs more than a traditional petrol or diesel-fueled vehicle. Only 33 percent accepted a maximum battery re-loading duration of two hours, added the ADAC. 'Hard' battle versus conventional cars Daimler chief Dieter Zetsche said electric cars had a \"damn hard\" battle in competition with conventional combustion motors because of their higher purchase cost and limited battery range. So-called car-sharing rental schemes in urban areas would provide key \"building blocks\" forward, Zetsche said. Earlier this month, the German ADFC cyclist club said over one million battery-assisted cycles called Pedeclecs are now used on Germany's roads and cycle routes. It forecast that a further 400,000 would come into use this year. ipj/jr (glp, dpa, Reuters, AFP)",

"story": "Japan, North Korea talk but are unlikely to agree Delegations are locked in talks on the Tokyo-Pyongyang relationship, but neither side has high hopes of a positive outcome. And many in Japan are firmly opposed to granting concessions without commitments. Representatives of the governments of Japan and North Korea have been holding talks in Stockholm, with the fate of Japanese nationals abducted by North Korean agents topping of the agenda. The three-day meeting will end on Wednesday, May 28. The Japanese insist that North Korea carries out a full and thorough investigation into the whereabouts of its missing citizens, many of whom were seized in remote coastal areas of northern Japan, bundled aboard ships and then taken to North Korea to train future generations of secret agents in the Japanese language and customs. Officially, Tokyo lists 17 Japanese as having been abducted by Pyongyang, although human rights activists believe the true number is over 800. North Korea has previously claimed that only 12 Japanese were seized, five of whom were permitted to return to Japan in 2002. The others, it claims, died in accidents, of illness or committed suicide. In return for a promise to launch a new investigation, North Korea says Japan must drop sanctions imposed on the regime after it conducted a series of nuclear and missile tests. The sanctions include a ban on the export of luxury goods to the secretive state, similar bans on financial transactions and the suspension of a ferry service that used to travel regularly between Niigata, in northern Japan, and the North Korean city of Wonsan. Simplest concession Experts believe that a resumption of the ferry service might be the easiest concession for Japan to make as it tries to ascertain the fate of its nationals. \"One of the sticking points from the Japanese position is that even if the North does promise to carry out a new search for the missing Japanese, they will not permit any third party to become involved and there will be no outside oversight, so how do we know they are genuinely carrying out a thorough investigation?\" asked Jun Okumura, a visiting scholar at the Meiji Institute for Global Affairs. \"But even given that situation, I would suggest that relaxing the ban on travelling to North Korea and permitting the ferry to restart journeys would probably be the easiest step for the Japanese government,\" he said. \"But I must say that I'm not very optimistic about much real progress emerging from these talks,\" Okumura added. That belief is echoed by the North Korean side, with Kim Myong-chol, executive director of The Centre for North Korea-US Peace and a mouthpiece for the regime in Pyongyang, telling DW that the chances of a breakthrough in Stockholm are \"not very high.\" \"Japan is demanding some kind of symbolic action from North Korea, but the bigger problem is that they have no idea about a real solution to the issue,\" he said. \"The Japanese do not even agree on how many people were allegedly abducted. Some say 10, others say 20 or 100. They have no idea.\" 'No more abductees' \"Personally, I do not believe there are any more Japanese in North Korea who do not want to be there and Japan is going to have to trust us on that, but the two sides are a long way apart and I do not think that trust is possible,\" he said. The government aside, the majority of Japanese people do not trust North Korea one inch. And that is hardly surprising given that Pyongyang consistently denied that it had anything to do with the disappearance of Japanese nationals until suddenly reversing that position in 2002. And while human rights groups agree that it is worthwhile to communicate with North Korea, they are strongly opposed to Japan immediately lifting all sanctions in return for North Korea's word that it will try to find the missing. On May 8, a group of NGOs representing families of the missing held talks with Shoichiro Ishikawa, secretary general of the Japanese Cabinet headquarters on the abduction issue, and handed over a petition signed by 18 organizations and 23 prominent individuals. The petition called on the Japanese government to employ probation-style lifting of sanctions, Ken Kato, director of Human Rights in Asia and a member of the International Coalition to Stop Crimes Against Humanity in North Korea, told DW. \"We believe that if North Korea does not return abducted Japanese nationals within a certain period, for example three months, then the government should not only re-impose those sanctions but also make them stronger,\" he said. Ishikawa said that he would instruct the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to insist that any \"re-investigation\" by the North Korean authorities would include all Japanese who may have been abducted by Pyongyang's agents. 860 Japanese missing According to Kato, Japan's National Police Agency has a list of no fewer than 860 missing Japanese nationals \"in which abduction by the North cannot be ruled out.\" Kato believes that Pyongyang simply cannot be trusted to carry out a genuine search for the people it kidnapped and to own up to its actions. And he is in favor of tightening the screw on a regime that he considers criminal and - because it is armed with nuclear weapons and missiles to deliver them - potentially a threat to world peace. \"I believe Japan should prohibit all remittances to North Korea that are above Y100,000 (some 720 USD), if they do not release Japanese abductees within a certain period,\" he said. \"At present, North Koreans living in Japan can send money to their homeland if they report it to the Japanese authorities,\" he said. \"This has been a source of funding for the North Korean regime's nuclear and missile programs. North Korea's weapons of mass destruction and crimes against humanity will never be solved if we do not stop the regime from gaining hard currency.\"",

"story": "The Many Laws of a Well-Ordered German Life If there is one quintessentially German word that has been woven into the fabric of society over the years, then it is \"Ordnung.\" Meaning \"order\" or \"orderliness,\" it represents the legs upon which the nation stands. It's just one word, but Ordnung's cultural scope shouldn't be taken lightly. It serves as a suffix that can be applied across the board to create a magnificent web of rules and regulations that makes up the bedrock of society. There is Hausordnung (house rules), Schulordung (school rules), Arbeitsordnung (work rules), Strassenverkehrsordnung (traffic rules), Sozialordnung (social order) and \u00d6ffentliche Ordnung (public order) and so the list goes on. These are the long-standing rules that prohibit dumping empty bottles into recycling bins on Sundays, crossing a road while the little man is flashing red and also lead to furrowed brows when children go outside in the winter without a hat, scarf and gloves or when a cashier is presented with a large bill rather than the correct change. While other countries have their own rulebooks, there is something particularly imposing about the German one. The fact is rules -- both official and unofficial -- rule. Order equals security Hans-Dieter Gelfert, a retired literature professor and freelance writer who has spent many years exploring the German, British and American mentalities, said the ordered society of modern Germany has been a long time in the making. \"Ordnung is one of the sacred words in Germany, and that has something to do with the German emphasis on security as opposed to liberty,\" he said. \"For the last thousand years security has always been the number one value and order is a mainstay of security.\" Gelfert said the fact that Germany long consisted of dozens of tribes which harbored open resentments against one another led them to crave a mythical unity, a desire to feel safe and secure and live in a tension-free zone. \"What could provide a tension-free zone?\" he asked. \"Only a well-ordered system where everybody would stick to the rules.\" But Germans are in fact no more orderly than many other Europeans, he added. \"Much of their behavior is disorderly, yet ideologically they believe in order,\" Gelfert said. \"But that doesn't mean people stick to the rules, just that they believe others ought to.\" Ruling the unruly The discrepancy between the ideology and the reality is self-evident in the domain of public order. Jens-Holger Kirchner of Berlin's District Council for Public Order said people are always ready to scold another person's misdemeanors without considering their own potential delinquencies. \"I'm always surprised at how ready people are to tell on their neighbors,\" Kirchner said. \"Someone else is always to blame. The cyclists tell us to chase the dog owners, the dog owners tell us to chase those who dump their rubbish illegally, and they tell us to chase the cyclists.\" German municipalities have public order authorities and dispatch patrols to issue parking tickets, prevent people from illegally dumping rubbish, check cyclists have lights and brakes, make sure dog owners pick up after their pets and ensure cafes don't take up too much space on the sidewalks and keep their noise levels down. For Kirchner, order means \"making sure one's own actions do not prevent others from moving freely. It is one of the pillars of democratic society.\" Rules, rules, rules Gelfert said he believes Germany would benefit from fewer pillars. \"We have far too many rules,\" he said. \"There are quite a few highly intelligent people who suggest that Germany should start a reform by doing away with 10,000 laws -- no matter which ones -- thereby creating more space for a free and rational process. \"But so far all efforts to do away with superfluous laws have been abortive,\" he added. \"They did get rid of some, but then replaced them with more new ones.\" Kirchner said he is looking forward to the introduction of some new laws slated for the coming months, including a smoking ban and stricter emissions rules for vehicles in central Berlin, and has already earmarked an increase in personnel to monitor public adherence, which he said the public wants. \"Since we started operating two years ago, the general feedback we have received is that there is still not enough order on the streets of Berlin,\" Kirchner said. \"People are not yet telling us that we live in a wonderfully ordered environment, but we'll get there.\" Gelfert said he believes that it will take another two or three generations before Germany realizes that it can survive without so many rules and regulations. \"This craving for security will be the last thing the Germans will overcome,\" he said.",

"story": "US shuts down popular file-sharing site A number of people have been arrested in New Zealand in a US effort to crackdown on online pirated material. Among those arrested was the German former CEO of the world's most popular file-sharing site, Megaupload. Four people have been arrested in New Zealand on US accusations of facilitating millions of illegal downloads of film and music content, costing copyright holders at least $500 million (386 million euros) in lost revenue. Among those arrested were Kim Dotcom, the founder, former CEO and current chief of innovation officer of Hong-Kong-based Megaupload. The 37-year-old man holds Finnish and German citizenship and was formerly known as Kim Schmitz and Kim Tim Jim Vestor. Two other German citizens and one Dutch citizen were also arrested, while another German, Slovakian and Estonian are still at large. A grand jury in Virginia had indicted and charged Megaupload with racketeering conspiracy, copyright infringement and conspiring to commit money laundering. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has called it one of the \"largest criminal copyright cases ever brought by the United States.\" According to information provided by the FBI and the US Justice Department, $50 million were seized in the operation along with 18 domain names. Cyber war The crackdown comes just a day after popular Internet companies Wikipedia and Craigslist shut down their services to protest two bills currently going through US Congress - the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect IP Act (PIPA) - which aim at curbing copyright infringement by going after sites offering pirated online material. Although the company operated out of Hong Kong and its former CEO lived in New Zealand, the company allegedly used servers in Virginia, giving US prosecutors reason enough to act. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online freedom advocacy group, said in a statement that the indictments set \"a terrifying precedent.\" \"If the United States can seize a Dutch citizen in New Zealand over a copyright claim, what is next?\" the group asked. The hacktivist group Anonymous responded to the arrests and shutdown of Megaupload by launching a cyber attack on the FBI and Justice Department websites, which were up and running again early Friday after being shut down for several hours. Megaupload was the world's largest file-sharing site with 150 million registered users, around 50 million daily hits and endorsements from music superstars. The website is said to have earned Dotcom $42 million in 2011. Author: Sarah Berning (AP, AFP) Editor: Nancy Isenson",

"story": "Thailand faces uncertain political future after king's death With the death of King Bhumibol, Thailand's fragile political truce could fast unravel. The military junta will no doubt seek a quick succession, but a possible revival of pro-democracy activism has unnerved the markets. The king, who had been the world's longest-reigning monarch and who died in Bangkok on Thursday aged 88, was widely seen to have been a key legimational figurehead overseeing the often fragile political truce in Thailand since the advent of the pro-democracy movement at the start of the decade. Revered as semi-divine by many in the country, the figure of Bhumibol held together an often fractious coalition of Bangkok business elites, a new middle class and its Thai Democrat party, and the royalist military to prevent the return of exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra or the electoral dominance of his party. Experts on the Thai royal family note that the country's strict lese-majeste laws muffle detailed discussion of the sensitive succession issue. \"We maybe shouldn't read too much into (the delay),\" David Streckfuss, an expert on the Thai monarchy, told the AFP news agency. \"But we have already departed from what should have been a normal succession process. An element of ambiguity has been injected into the situation.\" Tens of thousands pay last respects Meanwhile, throngs of Thai citizens lined the streets of the capital Bangkok Friday as a royal procession carried the late monarch from Siriraj Hospital to the Grand Palace. Many people had secured their positions on footpaths along the route the night before, shortly after the king's death was announced, and camped out there overnight. They were sitting on mats, with many holding small yellow flags bearing the king's emblem. The convoy, which included heir apparent Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, moved slowly through Bangkok's ancient quarter past mourners dressed in black, many of them holding aloft portraits of the king. Woraporn Jukkhom said she travelled to Bangkok from Lampang province, 600 kilometers (372 miles) north, as soon as she heard the news. \"I just had to be here,\" she told the DPA news agency. \"This is our last chance to say goodbye.\" Tradition calls for the bodies of Thai royals to be placed in a golden urn. But in a nod to modernity, palace officials said the tradition was no longer upheld and the king's body would be placed in a coffin with a symbolic royal urn near it. Military looks to cement its political role The military - which seized power in a May 2014 coup after months of street demonstrations against the elected government - will likely retain a firm grip over the country in the immediate term to ensure that the royal succession proceeds smoothly and does not become politicized. It has promised an election in 2017 and pushed through a constitution this year to ensure its oversight of civilian governments, but few hold their breath. The last election, in February 2014, was blocked by anti-government groups, and former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra was removed from office by the Constitutional Court. Popular among rural voters who supported her brother - former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra - she led protests in 2013 against a bill that intended to absolve Thaksin, a billionaire tycoon-turned-politician, of corruption charges. The urban middle class and royalist elite have resisted ceding control after Thaksin drew rural voters to the polls. It's all about succession All eyes are now on the succession, after the junta leader said Thursday that Vajiralongkorn had asked for time before being officially proclaimed the next monarch. Vajiralongkorn, 64, does not command the same respect that his father earned over a lifetime on the throne, but Thailand's laws limiting public discussion leave little room for public debate. Vajiralongkorn was named the heir apparent in 1972 by the king, and according to the constitution should ascend the throne as the constitutional monarch after approval by the National Assembly, which is a formality under the constitution. Since Bhumibol's reign began in 1946, Thailand has fluctuated between military backed bureaucratic authoritarianism and brief periods of constitutional semi-democracy. After a coup in 1957 by the nationalist General Sarit Thanarat, the monarchy was rehabilitated in the shape of Bhumibol as the symbolic focus of Thai Buddhist loyalty. Market indicators unclear The Bangkok stock market and baht currency have fallen in the last few days and some analysts predict further jitters. \"The death of Thailand's highly revered king will plunge the country into a state of mourning, and also deep political uncertainty,\" Capital Economics said in a note. \"The period of (relative) political calm since the 2014 coup has helped the economy recover... But renewed political instability could quickly derail this recovery.\" The Thai government declared Friday a national holiday of mourning, although the stock exchange and other financial institutions were to stay open as usual. OANDA said in a statement said that although the Thai baht and the stock exchange index will remain under pressure, much of the uncertainty premium is already built into the price of both, thus losses will be limited. jbh,jar/rc (AFP, AP, Reuters)",

"story": "Ivory seizure demonstrates challenge of protecting elephant populations Authorities in New York have seized $4.5 million (4 million euros) worth of illicit elephant ivory in one of the largest busts in the state's history. This comes as southern African countries want the total ban lifted. Law enforcement officials put seized ivory contraband on display with scores of statuettes, a carved column, two pairs of tusks and a chess set carved from the tusks of a dozen slain elephants. \"We are going to dry up... a market that only fuels the slaughter of elephants,\" New York City's chief prosecutor Cy Vance told reporters Thursday. \"It is inexcusable, it is immoral.\" New York City is a hub of illegal elephant ivory trade, ahead of California and Hawaii, said Basil Seggos, head of the state's Department of Environmental Conservation which cooperated in the investigation that involved undercover officers posing as buyers at a Manhattan art and antiquities shop. \"This type of behavior will no longer be tolerated,\" Seggos said. It is illegal to sell elephant ivory without a special license. But New York's rules were tightened so much in 2014 that they effectively banned ivory sales except under extremely limited circumstances. The US and China, among the world's biggest ivory consumers, have agreed to enact near-total bans on their domestic markets. A ban on the international ivory trade was enshrined in law under the UN's Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) signed in 1989. But even as poaching of endangered elephants for their tusks persists at dangerous levels, some African states are seeking a partial overturn of the global ban. In Namibia, where villagers and elephants are competing for scarce water in remote parts the country, the government is part of a host of countries pushing for the right to sell millions of dollars' worth of ivory at a CITES annual summit that opens this weekend. \"We at times have to go without water when the elephants are at the water points and wells the whole day,\" villager Iningirua Musaso told the Namibia Press Agency this month. Namibia is one of several southern African countries that want to sell their ivory stockpiles argue that it's OK to profit from elephants so that their people see wildlife as a natural resource worth protecting. Cash-strapped Zimbabwe has a 70 ton ivory stockpile worth $35 million. It says ivory trade is the only way to pay for protecting its elephants and to give rural communities an economic incentive for living near the animals which it argues that in some places populations are increasing. But they are opposed by about 30 nations that want to tighten an international ban on the ivory trade, including leading ivory consumer China which says it will close its domestic market. Conservationists alarmed \"We do recognize that Zimbabwe and Namibia's elephants populations are in better shape than those elsewhere in Africa,\" said Susan Lieberman, vice president for International Policy at the Wildlife Conservation Society. \"But it's rather short-sighted and a bit selfish for them to request to sell their ivory, knowing full well that it will further stimulate poaching and trafficking from other populations. The global community needs to see this as an Africa-wide issue.\" Frank Pope, operations manager at Save the Elephants, a Kenya-based group, says it's vital that protections for elephants are not watered down which he predicts would undermine the success of international cooperation in clamping down on poaching. \"If one of the nations that wants to sell ivory decides to sell ivory and manages to put that onto the market, that creates a smoke screen for an illegal trade to flourish across the whole of the rest of the continent,\" he said. The countries' formal request to sell stockpiles, collected through seizures of contraband, natural mortality in the wild and the shooting of problem animals, will be considered at a meeting of the UN's CITES meeting in Johannesburg from September 24 to October 5. jar/jil (AFP, AP, Reuters)",

"story": "EU Split Over Imposing Tougher Entry Conditions on Turkey European Union leaders have divergent views on Turkey's troubled bid to join the 25-nation bloc, with Germany and France set to call for tougher conditions on Ankara. Finland, Sweden, Estonia and Poland want doors open. Representing EU hardliners, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Jacques Chirac are meeting in Mettlach, Germany, to demand stronger action against Ankara for refusing to open its ports to Greek Cypriot vessels. Both leaders said last week's proposals by the European Commission for a partial suspension of Turkish accession talks needs to be toughened up by introducing a \"review clause\" allowing any EU state to veto a resumption of negotiations with Ankara. \"Our goal is that the Ankara Protocol (on regular trade with the 10 new EU members) will be implemented,\" she told reporters. \"We don't want to set any kind of ultimatum.\" Merkel, who opposes Turkey's full entry to the EU but supports offering the country a \"privileged partnership,\" has said a vote should only take place after an 18-month waiting period. Differing opinions However, in comments made to the European Parliament, Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said he favored the commission's call for a partial freeze in talks. Vanhanen said the commission's stance provided a \"good basis for a decision\" on Turkey when EU foreign ministers meet in Brussels next Monday. The commission -- the EU's executive agency -- is urging the bloc's governments to put negotiations on ice for eight of 35 policy areas covered in the talks because of Turkey's non-compliance with EU demands. The Finnish premier also insisted that he wanted discussions on Turkey to be kept off the agenda of the EU summit in Brussels on Dec.14 and 15. While admitting ties with Ankara were difficult at the moment, Vanhanen said plans for opening the European club to Turkey should be kept on track. Open door Ties between Poland and EU heavyweights France and Germany were strained further when Polish President Lech Kaczynski contradicted the Franco-German view on Turkish accession at a summit on Tuesday. \"Poland is of the view that membership talks with Turkey should continue,\" he said. The foreign ministers of Estonia and Sweden have also cold-shouldered Merkel and Chirac's tough line. \"Our relations to Turkey should be neither frozen nor should any doors for further (EU) expansion be closed,\" said Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt and Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet in comments published in the German daily Die Welt. Both ministers said continuing membership talks with Ankara was vital to insure that Turkey continued its democratic reforms. Bildt and Paet underlined that the division of Cyprus could only be resolved by working with the Turkish government. The island has been split since 1974 between the Greek Cypriot south, which is part of the EU, and the Turkish north which is not recognized and subject to an EU boycott. \"A reunification of Cyprus will only be achieved if Turkey is brought closer to the EU --otherwise there is the apparent risk of a permanent division,\" the ministers said. Other countries onboard Britain and Italy are also part of the growing number of EU states opposed to an overly harsh stance on Turkey. In addition, Ankara's allies in the United States have weighed into the debate. US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burn said in Brussels late Monday that any move to close the door on Turkish membership would be a major \"strategic miscalculation.\" The US envoy said the EU's decision last year to open accession talks with Turkey was one of the most important decisions made by Europe at the beginning of the 21st century. \"Turkey is the bridge\" between the West and Islam, Burn said of the predominantly Muslim country. Turkey warns of \"historic mistake\" In comments made in Ankara, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan also cautioned the EU against making a \"historic mistake.\" \"Turkey is as important for the European Union as the European Union is for Turkey,\" said Erdogan, who accused \"certain right-wing\" parties in Europe of lacking vision. The Turkish prime minister has said repeatedly that Ankara would only move on the ports issue once an international embargo was lifted on northern Turkish Cyprus which voted in favor of a UN-sponsored reunification plan for the island in 2004. EU foreign ministers will try and clinch agreement on how to proceed with Turkey in talks in Brussels on Dec. 11. However, diplomats in Brussels concede that given the high stakes in EU-Turkey relations, EU leaders will also have to inevitably discuss the question.",

"story": "World Day Against Child Labor highlights conditions on US tobacco farms An estimated 500,000 children are working on tobacco fields in the United States, most of them in extremely hazardous conditions. World Day Against Child Labor, on June 12, aims to highlight the plight of the children. Celia Ortiz was only 11 when she started working on tobacco fields in North Carolina. When most children were sleeping late, watching television, or riding their bicycle during spring breaks, Celia would wake up each morning at five to harvest crops for 10 or 12 hours in extremely dangerous conditions. She worked on tobacco fields for seven years. \"When you're a child, you're out there because you need the money,\" she said. \"It's not like you're looking for fun.\" Celia is taking part in the World Day Against Child Labor on June 12 with members of the Child Labor Coalition - a group of nonprofit organizations including Human Rights Watch. The coalition gathered in Washington DC to raise awareness and discuss problems and possible solutions for the country's child labor issue. There are four states that produce 90 percent of the country's tobacco - North Carolina, Kentucky, Virginia, and Tennessee - and in these states children as young as 7 are working 50-60 hours per week harvesting and cultivating tobacco plants, in most cases with severe repercussions. Human Rights Watch estimates nearly half a million such children work on these fields. \"This is perfectly legal in the US,\" says Zama Coursen-Neff, executive director of the children's rights division at Human Rights Watch. \"[It is legal] because of a loophole in child labor laws that makes it legal for children to work in agriculture at far younger ages, for far longer hours, under far more hazardous environments.\" Nicotine exposure Coursen-Neff took part in an initiative that spoke to over 140 child workers across the United States. \"Three-quarters of them reported frequently feeling dizzy, nauseous, or vomiting in the fields,\" she said. Two-thirds of them displayed symptoms of Green Tobacco Sickness, or nicotine poisoning. This occurs when workers are exposed to wet tobacco plants, through either rain or morning dew, and contact with the plants causes their skin to absorb the toxins. This is extremely hazardous to the younger workers. \"Nicotine exposure during adolescence leads to mood disorders, attention deficit, lasting cognitive disorders,\" Coursen-Neff explained. For Celia, this was all too familiar. She recalls feeling the symptoms of nicotine exposure. \"You get dizzy and nauseous,\" she said. \"The world is closing in on you and you feel like you're going to die. I can't even explain it properly.\" Celia says she only learned of the hazards of her work last year. \"From all the years that I worked, they never informed us of the dangers and hazards. When you're young you don't know what to do.\" Child workers were not given proper protection against the nicotine exposure or frequent usage of pesticide sprays on the crops, which would also fall on their clothes and skin. They were left to find their own ways of protection. \"We would put on garbage bags and put holes in them for our head and feet,\" Celia said. \"And we didn't have rain boots so we put grocery bags over our shoes.\" Humiliation and danger The conditions grew worse as Celia worked over the years. Eventually the farmers stopped providing water to the workers. The children brought their own to stay hydrated, but that led to more complications. \"Going to the restroom is another problem. You would have to go to the other side of the field just so nobody could see, just to get some privacy. It's dangerous, especially being a young lady.\" These lengthy trips for solitude were often met with harsh demands for faster and harder work. \"I knew it was wrong that we didn't get water,\" she remembered. \"I knew it was wrong we didn't get restrooms. I knew it was wrong they sprayed pesticide while we were working.\" Even then, Celia said, there was too much fear to say anything. \"It was hard for me to speak up and say, 'Hey I'm sick please take me off the row.' Because you want to prove to adults that you can work like they can, and you want to be paid. That's the fear factor about speaking up.\" The environment also presented psychological stresses of insecurities and self-doubt. \"In one instance I was humiliated and belittled because I didn't do the job as well [as an adult]. I started to think, 'If I can't do this job what makes me think I can do an office job?'\" But even that office job is usually a pipe dream. \"Unfortunately,\" explained Coursen-Neff, \"the interference of their education and the negative health effects of working in agriculture in the United States perpetuates a cycle of poverty that ultimately leave children often without any other options except to continue working in the fields.\" She says it's time to break the cycle. \"This is a solvable problem. Children are too young to buy cigarettes, and yet right now children are working in fields in the United States being poisoned by nicotine in the fields, and these bills that are in Congress right now can do something about that.\" The Child Labor Coalition is hoping to lobby for changes to the law, amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 that would prohibit child employment in tobacco-related agriculture by \"deeming such employment as oppressive child labor.\" As for Celia, she will return to work. Not in the fields, though - she did get that office job, in a bank. The hope is to turn her exception to the rule into a more common occurrence.",

"story": "World Bank aims to conquer extreme hunger Being extremely poor means living on less than $1.25 a day. The World Bank is now endeavoring to eradicate such circumstances by the year 2030. But some are criticizing the organization's development strategy. New World Bank President Jim Yong Kim is optimistic: \"A world without poverty is within reach,\" he said in a speech in Washington this week. \"We are at an auspicious moment in history when the successes of past decades and an increasingly favorable economic outlook combine to give developing countries a chance - for the first time ever - to end extreme poverty within a generation,\" he said during his speech at Georgetown University. The key to that success: continued economic growth, especially in South Asia and African nations south of the Sahara. Also, the fruits of that growth must be distributed more justly, Kim said. According to the World Bank, the \"extremely poor\" are those who have less than one euro (or around $1.25) a day to live on. Estimates show that in 2010, some 1.2 billion people were living in extreme poverty. Around 870 million went hungry every day. Some 6.9 million infants and toddlers die from a lack of food each year. If the World Bank had its way, the proportion of the global extremely poor would sink from the current 21 percent to under three percent by 2030. In announcing this new goal, Kim was also making a link to the United Nations Millennium Goals, which called for reducing the number of extremely poor by half between the years 1990 and 2015. The UN achieved this goal in the year 2010. The economic advancement of countries such as China, India and Brazil has contributed to millions of people being able to escape extreme poverty - even if they are still part of the group of poor who must live on two to 10 dollars a day, Kim said. Pre-condition for tackling poverty The World Bank president said that continued growth in emerging markets was a pre-condition for achieving this new goal. Further investments in education and in public institution were also necessary, he said. Concentration must also be placed on dealing with the after- effects of natural catastrophes, with climate change being a fundamental threat to economic development and eradicating poverty, he noted. A step in the right direction The World Bank said it would consider this new goal more closely than in the past and would regularly remind legislators from its 188 member states of the aim of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030. Kim said his organization would measure progress in meeting the goal and publish results in an annual report. Mikkel Barslund is a political scientist with the Center for European Policy Studies, and believes the World Bank is on the right track. \"The change must take place through economic development in the individual countries, but the World Bank can have a certain amount of influence by frequently calling attention to the problem,\" he said. Criticism from Attac But some have also criticized the World Bank's development plan. \"The World Bank's strategy is to open up markets and put world trade at centerstage, but this often ends up destroying the existence of small farmers,\" said Roland S\u00fcss, of the globalization-critical network Attac. China, he pointed out, went about things quite differently. \"The country first safeguarded its structures, and then opened up its markets. So it took the exact opposite approach to the one being propagated by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund,\" S\u00fcss said.",

"story": "ICC weighs war crimes case on Ivorian ex-president Gbagbo The International Criminal Court is weighing the prosecution\u2019s case against the former president of the Ivory Coast. Laurent Gbagbo faces four counts of crimes against humanity for post-election violence in 2010-2011. Former Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo faced the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague for a pre-trial hearing on Tuesday, making him the first former head of state to appear before the world's permanent war crimes tribunal. A three-judge panel is considering whether or not the case against Gbagbo is enough to send the ex-president to trial. The judges have until February 28 to make their decision. Gbagbo faces four counts of crimes against humanity \u2013 including rape and murder \u2013 for allegedly fomenting violence after he refused to concede a November 2010 presidential election to his opponent Alassane Ouattara. Four months of fighting followed the contested election, leaving some 3,000 people dead. Gbagbo was ultimately ousted by French forces, UN peacekeepers and pro-Ouattara forces. Allegations of massacres The prosecutors argued that Gbagbo tried to \u201cstay in power by all means\u2026through carefully planned, sustained and deadly attacks\u201d against perceived supporters of Ouattara. They accused Gbagbo forces of massacring at least 80 people in Yopougon \u2013 a suburb of the capital, Abidjan \u2013 one day after the ex-president was arrested in April 2011. But the defense called for the case to be declared inadmissible, arguing for Gbagbo to face trial in the Ivory Coast. The ICC is a court of last resort, intervening only when the local judiciary proves either unable or unwilling to prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity. \u201cIvory Coast is neither unable nor unwilling to prosecute President Gbagbo,\u201d defense lawyer Dov Jacobs told the judges on Tuesday. Victor's justice? Some 300 Gbagbo supporters gathered outside of the court in The Hague, calling for the former president to be freed. \u201cWe're here today because President Gbagbo is to appear before the ICC even though he's a democratically elected president and the charges against him should be for Alassane Ouattara,\u201d Hubert Seka, who travelled from Italy, told the AFP news agency. Although the New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) praised the proceedings against Gbagbo, the group also expressed concern that investigations against pro-Ouattara forces were not moving fast enough. \u201cHolding Gbagbo to account is a critical step for victims in [Ivory Coast],\u201dParam-Preet Singh, senior international justice counsel at HRW, said in a release. \u201cBut the slow pace of investigations against pro-Ouattara forces feeds the perception that the ICC is going along with victor's justice.\u201d slk/dr (AP, AFP)",

"story": "+++ Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg in EU Parliament: As it happened +++ Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced a row of questions from the leaders of the European Parliament over the social media giant's privacy polices and a data leak scandal. Read how it unfolded here. Facebook head Mark Zuckerberg faced a barrage of questions from European Parliament leaders in a live-streamed meeting on Tuesday. Although Zuckerberg apologized for a data leak scandal and said Facebook will comply with the EU's tough new data protection law, he still left many specific questions unanswered, including on the use of targeted ads. MEPs appeared displeased with Zuckerberg's answers and the time limit on the meeting. All updates in Central European Summer Time 19:45 Verhofstadt pushed back against Zuckerberg's answers, saying that he hadn't delivered adequate answers. The Facebook CEO says he will follow up with a written response in the coming days before adjourning the meeting. Multiple MEPs voiced their dissatisfaction with Zuckerberg's responses. 19:43 Zuckerberg sidesteps MEPs calls for more concrete answers on their specific questions, asking: \"Are there any other themes that we should cover?\" 19:40 Addressing Farage's question about Facebook's alleged anti-conservative bias, Zuckerberg became more animated when he urged: \"We have never and will not make decisions about what content is allowed or how we do ranking on the basis of a political orientation.\" 19:37 On the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Zuckerberg says the site \"expects to be fully compliant\" when the law comes into effect on Friday. 19:33 Addressing Europe's staunch regulatory agencies, Zuckerberg said he wasn't necessarily opposed to increased regulation: \"I don't think the question here is whether there should be regulation, but what kind of regulation there should be.\" He also brushed off accusations that Facebook is a monopoly, saying the company needs to remain competitive. He also alleged that the platform enables small business to reach their customers. 19:30 Zuckerberg broke down the issue of fake news into three areas: Spammers, fake accounts, and people sharing false information. He says less than 1 percent of accounts on Facebook are fake. 19:26 Getting a chance to respond to questions, Zuckerberg first tackles the issue of \"inappropriate content\" on the platform \u2014 including hate speech, terrorism and bullying \u2014 saying they have \"no place on our services.\" \"We will never be perfect on this,\" he admits, but says Facebook is transitioning from community flagging to using artificial intelligence tools to identify content that violates the site's standards. 19:13 Zuckerberg takes a sip of water, looking more ashen and grave as the list of questions from EU lawmakers piles up in his notes as time ticks down on the session for his answers. Read more: Cambridge Analytica: The devil in the detail 19:10 Nigel Farage, the co-head of the euroskeptic Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy party, alleged that Facebook is biased against conservative views, asking for more transparency in the process of removing flagged content and accounts. \"I'm beginning to wonder if we need a social media bill of rights,\" he said. 19:00 Along with asking what Facebook's concrete plans are for reducing the spread of \"fake news,\" a German member of the European United Left-Nordic Green Left, Gabi Zimmer, asked what Facebook will do to reduce violence against women \u2014 noting the site's beginnings as a \"hot or not\" rating site. Earlier, the head of the center-left Socialists and Democrats Group, Udo Bullmann, asked Zuckerberg what he plans on doing about the number of fake Facebook accounts, asking for concrete numbers. 18:52 Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the liberal ALDE political group, delivered a fiery address, questioning Zuckerberg's sincerity in his pledge to adhere to the new EU data protection law. He noted that Facebook has now started transferring data to servers based outside of Europe, which would violate the new rules. \"I really think we have a big problem here,\" Verhofstadt said, asking if Zuckerberg wants to be remembered as an internet giant \"or a genius that has created a digital monster.\" 18:40 Manfred Weber, a German MEP who is the leader of the center-right European People's Party, told Zuckerberg: \"To apologize is a good thing ... you know this is not enough, but we need more action.\" He also asked Zuckerberg whether other firms other than Cambridge Analytica have abused Facebook user data. Weber also asked Zuckerberg \"to convince me\" why he shouldn't break up Facebook as a monopoly. 18:35 Zuckerberg vowed to make advertising \"more transparent\" on the site, including making it harder for fake news sites to profit from ads. He also said that Facebook plays an important role in elections, noting that he worked with the German government to prevent tampering during the 2017 general election. 18:31 In addressing the EU's tough new data protection law, Zuckerberg said that the social media company is going even further than the law \u2014 including letting people delete data gathered by the site. 18:29 Dressed again in a suit and tie, Zuckerberg addressed EU lawmakers \u2014 admitting that he's made \"mistakes.\" \"We haven't done enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well. We have not done enough to prevent misuse.\" 18:20 President Tajani opened the meeting sitting next to Zuckerberg, saying that EU citizens deserve a detailed explanation concerning the Cambridge Analytica data leak scandal. \"Democracy should never become a marketing operation where anyone who buys our data can buy political advantage,\" he said. 18:15 Zuckerberg has arrived in Brussels and shaken hands with European Parliament President Antonio Tajani. MEPs are taking their seats ahead of questioning the embattled head of the social media giant. German Green MEP Jan Philipp Albrecht and one of the driving forces behind the EU's new data privacy law will soon get his turn to question him.",

"story": "Elections in Pakistan: the major players Many Pakistanis are hoping for a political change, even though there is no clear alternative to an increasingly unpopular PPP. There are fears that the need to form a viable coalition might lead to weak government. At the last parliamentary election in 2008, the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) under the leadership of Asif Ali Zardari was elected to form a new government - and it was one that made history. In March 2013, a civilian government in Pakistan was able to formally conclude its term for the first time. Now that new elections will be held, possible political candidates have been presenting themselves. Apart from the regular candidates, there seems to be an alternative. But even though the population is eagerly expecting a change, experts think it is highly unlikely. To evaluate the current political sentiment, the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in Pakistan conducted a survey with help from the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Institute. The survey, which was commissioned between October and December 2012, shows that people are skeptical of the political leadership in the country, according to SDPI director Abid Suleri. The results showed that the then governing party, the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), was regarded as particularly corrupt, whereas the military, the judiciary and the media were believed to be less open to bribery. Cricketing celebrity status In this year's election campaign, the main political parties are accused of relying on the celebrity status of their candidates, rather than a clear party program. Former cricket star Imran Khan, with his center-right Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) party, is believed to be one of them. Although he vehemently differentiates himself from the two major parties - the PPP and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) - he lacks political experience and a clear agenda. \"Imran Khan's Tehreek-e-Insaaf has surely laid the main focus of the election program on the agricultural sector,\" Christian Wagner of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP) told DW. \"But its members are accused of being inconsistent. Most of them are former supporters of the two major parties who joined the PTI out of frustration or for more political power.\" However, Imran Khan has been able to win over young political candidates and voters with his charismatic manner. Weak government expected Although the SDPI survey was conducted five months prior to the elections, basic trends in voting behavior can be predicted. The three largest political parties in Pakistan - the PPP of the recent president Asif Ali Zardari, the PML-N of former president and industrialist Nawaz Sharif and the currently popular Khan's PTI are expected to each receive 20 to 30 percent of the votes. \"This result would enable several scenarios for coalitions,\" said Wagner. Petersen believes the winners of the election will be forced to search for coalition partners which will primarily pursue their own interests. Therefore she thinks the outcome of the elections might be that the \"the next Pakistani government will be a weak one.\" Military's power still crucial A consideration of the military, seen as the real lever of power in Pakistan, is needed to predict what the forthcoming elections will bring. According to experts, it remains the most important authority of the country and also controls a large part of the economy. Suleri points out that the recent government was able to increase its influence in the department of foreign affairs and the military could no longer override the government as easily as before. However, experts doubt that the military will refrain from exerting political influence in future. The military as well as the secret service still act as a state within the state. \"We have seen that the military, which was formerly very active in Pakistani politics, has formally withdrawn,\" Wagner stressed. \"Yet, this does not necessarily mean it has lost its power of influence.\" The military has made it clear that it will fully support the upcoming democratic elections, as it has a strong interest in a stable country. Little change in practice Britta Petersen draws a different conclusion from the past five years of the PPP-government. It may have triggered many initiatives in the field of women\u2019s rights, climate policy and food supplies but \"the main problem is that all these legal and regulatory texts are waiting to be applied in practice.\" The PPP has failed in its plans to provide the population with the basic needs. The food and energy supplies of the country are in a disastrous state. Pakistan is yearning for a political change, claims Petersen, but this is unlikely to take place. Both Petersen and Suleri believe that Imran Khan will merely establish himself as a political player in Pakistan. \"Maybe the elections in 2018 will hold chances for Imran Khan to get a higher office, but certainly not in the current elections,\" said Suleri.",

"story": "Myanmar opens up for foreign investors The government of Myanmar has indicated that it plans to usher in a new era of business transparency in its oil, gas and other industries. Auctions for the rights to explore deposits are being prepared. Myanmar's government on Monday announced a new drive to open its economy to badly needed foreign investment. Energy Ministry officials pledged a new era of transparency particularly in the country's oil and gas industry. The ministry's assistant director, Aung Kyaw Htoo, promised international standards would be upheld in auctions for the rights to explore and exploit lucrative energy reserves. \"Transparency is the most important word,\" he said at a conference in Yangon with several major foreign oil firms attending. In January, Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, invited potential investors to tenders for 18 onshore oil blocks, with a further 50 offshore blocks expected to be opened to offers by April. Overcoming past restraints The government is under pressure to make sure its approach to natural resources will bring wider development to its people and is carried out sustainably, with all contract-related payments to be published for scrutiny. Western powers have been rolling back sanctions against Myanmar in response to political reforms. Transnational energy giants Total and Chevron were among the Western corporations represented at the conference. Myanmar theoretically produces enough natural gas to meet its domestic demand, but it has been forced to export some 80 percent of it to Thailand under contracts signed when the government was desperate for foreign currency. The pending auctions are part of an effort to help overcome an energy deficit that's a legacy of the deals made by the country's former military rulers. hg/pfd (AFP, AP)",

"story": "One Million Revelers Line Streets of Cologne for Carnival The World Cup was the theme, but revelers also poked fun at the bird flu crisis as one million people took to the streets of Cologne on Monday for the biggest carnival of the season in Germany. The Rose Monday parade is the high point of a week of festivities which sees Germans letting down their hair, donning silly costumes and consuming liberal quantities of sweets and beer. People braved freezing temperatures in Cologne to line the seven-kilometer (four-mile) route of the parade to catch a glimpse of the 96 floats which began rolling at the traditional time of 11:11 am. \"Carnival is part of life, like eating and drinking. You should never miss carnival, even if there is rain and snow,\" said Gisela Gehlen, 66, who was part of a group of women waiting to see their grandchildren on one of the floats. The nearby cities of D\u00fcsseldorf and Mainz also held carnival parades on Monday, attended by hundreds of thousands. No bird flu blues in Cologne In line with the generally irreverent atmosphere, some revelers in Cologne donned face masks and what appeared to be white chemical protection suits marked with the words \"I will survive H5N1\" to poke fun at the stringent measures introduced following the recent outbreak of bird flu in several German regions. One man dressed as a bird wore a notice saying \"I have been vaccinated\". With the World Cup kicking off in just over 100 days, many revelers wore football jerseys or black and white hats to resemble balls. Wolfram Teggen, a 46-year-old reveler from Cologne, went one step further, dressing in an oversized green tunic made to look like a soccer pitch. \"I am not even a football fan. I'll just be glad if Germany gets through the first round, but I don't think they'll reach the final,\" he said. Pure fun Sweets and chocolates rained down on the crowd from the floats, as marching bands played music that was upbeat if not always in tune. Carnival is a tradition stemming from Catholic regions in the west and south of Germany, but it is rapidly being adopted by cities in the north and east, such as in Berlin where half a million people gathered for a parade on Sunday. It is held before the Christian season of Lent, which starts on Wednesday.",

"story": "Medecins Sans Frontieres says 355 were killed in alleged Syrian chemical attack The medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres has said 355 people died from an alleged chemical weapons attack in Syria. A top UN official is in Syria to urge government forces to allow an inquiry into the alleged attack. Three hospitals near Syria's capital Damascus reported a total of about 355 deaths after an alleged chemical attack last Wednesday, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said on Saturday. The medical charity said about 3,600 Syrians showed \"neurotoxic symptoms\" within the first three hours of the alleged attack. The Syrian opposition accuses Assad's regime of using chemical weapons on a rebel-held suburb outside of the capital. The Syrian government has denied the allegations, and most recently said the attack was carried out by the rebels. Meanwhile, United Nations High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, Angela Kane, arrived in Damascus to press Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government for an inquiry into Wednesday's alleged chemical weapons attacks. UN chief Ban Ki-moon has tasked Kane with establishing the terms of an inquiry with Syrian officials and has also called on the opposition to cooperate. Assad's regime has yet to say if it will allow a UN team of chemical weapons experts, already on the ground since Sunday to probe three other sites, to inspect the latest allegations. Military chiefs to meet Top military officials from the US, Britain and several Arab countries are to meet in Amman, Jordan this week to discuss the situation in Syria, the Jordanian state news agency reported Saturday. Top military brass from the US, France, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Russia, Italy, Canada, Turkey and Qatar are reportedly going to attend the meeting. Meanwhile, US President Barack Obama was to meet early Saturday with top national security advisors to discuss Washington's possible next steps in Syria. \"The president has directed the intelligence community to gather facts and evidence so that we can determine what occurred in Syria. Once we ascertain the facts, the president will make an informed decision about how to respond,\" a White House official said. \"We have a range of options available, and we are going to act very deliberately so that we're making decisions consistent with our national interest as well as our assessment of what can advance our objectives in Syria,\" the official said. Obama has been under growing pressure to act following reports of the alleged chemical weapons attack. Last year he warned that proven use of the chemical arms in Syria would cross a \"red line,\" and prompt US action. On Friday Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Obama had asked the US Defense Department to provide him with military options on Syria. \"The Defense Department has a responsibility to provide the president with all options for contingencies,\" said Hagel. More than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria since March 2011, according to UN estimates. Millions more have fled the country or have been internally displaced. hc/rc (Reuters, AFP, AP, dpa)",

"story": "India prepares to introduce plastic banknotes India has decided to trial the use of plastic notes across five of the country's cities. It is part of a move, experts say, aimed at reducing costs, increasing the life of notes and combating counterfeit currency. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is getting ready to circulate 1 billion plastic, or polymer, bank notes of the 10 rupee denomination, which equals around 14 euro cents, across five Indian cities. Kochi, Mysore, Jaipur, Bhubaneshwar and Shimla have been chosen for their vast geographical differences and to test the effects their varying climates may have on the plastic notes. The switch to plastic banknotes, Alpana Killawala, spokesperson at the Reserve Bank of India said, is not only aimed at increasing the longevity of the notes but also a move to tackle people attempting to counterfeit the currency. Plastic vs. paper Thirteen billion banknotes were withdrawn from circulation in 2009-2010, the RBI reported - amounting to a quarter of all banknotes in circulation at the time. Polymer bank notes are more expensive to produce. While no cost analysis has been done in India of paper printing versus plastic, central banks in Canada and New Zealand report that producing plastic banknotes is double that of paper. But, with the significantly longer circulation life of polymer notes, it is hoped the expense of printing replacement paper notes and disposing of soiled or torn currency will be cut, Kishore Jhunjhunwalla, co-author of the \"Standard Reference Guide to Indian Paper Monday,\" told DW. \"In India most notes, especially the lower denominations like 10 rupee notes which are circulated the most, get very dirty and damaged quickly. People here often scribble on notes, crease them and make them ugly - they cannot do so if they are plastic notes.\" Plastic bank notes, Jhunjhunwalla added, can be easily cleaned. With the latest available technology they are also able to be recycled. Along with their environmental benefit, polymer banknotes are also more hygienic, Dr Arindam Ghosh from the Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata told DW in an interview. \"The paper notes get very dirty in humid regions of India and they are carriers of many germs. If finally a switchover to plastic notes takes place in India, the banknotes will be cleaner from a hygienic point of view, and we shall be able to cut down on many infections that are spreading through soiled paper notes now.\" Fake banknotes In 2009-2010 alone, the RBI reported detecting more than 400,000 counterfeit notes of varying denominations. Indian media reported recently that counterfeit money currently in circulation could be as much as 120,000 billion rupees. Experts believe polymer notes would curb the problem of fake money generation, as has been done in countries like New Zealand, Canada and Vietnam where the plastic currency has been fully introduced. \"Modern polymer banknotes are very difficult to replicate or copy using high-grade home printers. The security features such as the transparent windows, micro-printed watermarks, hidden numbers and raised ink assist in making the polymer notes more secure,\" said Rezwan Razack, second author of \"Standard Reference Guide to Indian Paper Money,\" in an interview with DW. \"If they come into circulation, polymer notes look like a solution to India's counterfeit problem.\" Developed in Australia, modern polymer banknotes were first issued in 1988 as a more secure and durable alternative to paper notes. \"A decision to issue plastic banknotes for long term circulation will be taken on the basis of the outcome of the field trial,\" junior finance minister S. S. Palanimanickam told India's parliament last month. If the trial circulation of the 10 rupee notes goes smoothly, the RBI will introduce polymer notes of higher denominations in future. No date as been given for the start of the trial.",

"story": "Cazeneuve, Merkel reaffirm Paris-Berlin links France's new premier Bernard Cazeneuve says the French-German partnership remains a \"daily lived reality.\" Welcoming him on his first visit to Berlin, Chancellor Merkel said a strong Europe depends on their two nations. Cazaneuve on Monday began a two-day visit to Berlin, emphasizing that the Paris-Berlin dialog was \"so important\" for Europe in turbulent times in which populists had become louder and the EU faced strains. Answers had to be communicated to those who had doubts about Europe's \"added value,\" said France's premier on his first bilateral trip abroad. \"It's also our joint obligation to push for the stability of the eurozone and to ensure growth and employment,\" said Cazeneuve, referring to joblessness, which is relatively high among young people in France. 'Intertwinned,' says Merkel Chancellor Angela Merkel told a Berlin news conference that Germany and France were \"intertwined\" through close trade relations. \"Europe can only be strong when both countries prosper economically,\" she said. Merkel also vowed intensive consultation with France on anti-terror initiatives. Danger could only be mitigated through close cooperation, she added. Cazeneuve praises Merkel's 'courage' Cazeneuze praised what he called Merkel's \"courage\" during the so-called refugee crisis of 2015 and early 2016, when migrants transited Aegean-Balkans routes, heading mainly for Germany and Scandinavia. In its aftermath, Europe needed \"stronger controls of the EU's external borders,\" Cazeneuve said, coupled with joint efforts by all EU nations to cope with arrivals in the context of the \"values of humanity.\" Only indirectly did Cazeneuve refer to the new US President Donald Trump, saying it was good that Paris and Berlin spoke with one voice on transatlantic relations. Cazeneuve-Schulz encounter on Tuesday On Tuesday, the second day of Cazeneuve's Berlin visit, he is due to hold talks with Germany's new Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, the German federal Bundestag parliament's president Norbert Lammert and the Social Democrats' candidate for chancellor in Germany's September election, Martin Schulz, the former president of the European Parliament. Gabriel and Schulz are leading figures in Germany's Social Democratic (SPD) party, which since 2013 has been partner in Merkel's grand coalition, which also comprises her conservative CDU and Bavaria's CSU parties. Lammert, renouned for his advocacy of democracy, belongs to Merkel's Christian Democrats and led election proceedings last Sunday that saw Frank-Walter Steinmeier become German president, a largely ceremonial post. Cazeneuve rose from interior minister to French premier under President Francois Hollande in December, replacing Manuel Valls who later unsuccessfully sought the French Socialists' candidacy for France's presidential elections in April and May. In an opinion poll published on Tuesday in France, Emmanuel Macron, a former Minister of Economy in the socialist government of Francois Hollande, was forecast to win a second round vote in May for the presidency with 64 percent of the vote to 36 percent for far right leader of the FN, Marine le Pen. In a first round at the end of April, le Pen was forecast by Opionway to take 27 percent, ahead of Macron on 22 percent and Francois Fillon with 20 percent. The socialist candidate Benoit Hamon is trailing. ipj/kl (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

"story": "'The DFB has lost touch with the fans' The DFB has introduced plenty of things to upset the fans: varying kickoff times, VAR and China's U20s playing in the country's fourth tier. Fan researcher Harald Lange told DW that the fans have every right to be angry. DW: Professor Lange, has the German football association (DFB) lost touch with the fans? Harald Lange: This has been true for some time now. This is because fans are not usually the center of attention for the league and club executives. They are perceived as paying customers, as consumers, rather than as passionate, proud fans who contribute to football's culture. Is the DFB actually after a different target audience than the supporters that one usually sees on the terraces? They have a very different view of the fans on the terraces. The DFB tends to perceive them as a disruptive factor, when they protest, when they cross the line, or because they just don't fit into their aesthetics. The belief is that when the fans that create the atmosphere stop attending games, others will replace them. But this won't work in the future. Two weeks ago, there was a meeting between DFB President Reinhard Grindel and representatives of Ultras and other fan groups. The DFB later stated that an open and frank discussion had taken place, but there was no comment from the fan groups. Is this a symptom of the problem? The fans are very distrusting. On the one hand, Mr. Grindel has made concessions and seems to have reached out to fans by doing things like suspending collective punishments. However, the fans don't know how to take this. They don't know whether the DFB has done this simply to curb the criticism of it that was seen in the stadiums in the first few games, or whether it is genuinely interested in building an idea of fan culture that is shared by supporters. The list of complaints against the DFB is long. For one thing, the fans complain about the changing game times and increasing prices. Isn't it understandable for the fans to be skeptical? Of course it is. The underlying question is: What is so special about our fan culture? And above all, who does football belong to? Everybody involved is claiming ownership. The fact of the matter is that without the fans, football as we know it wouldn't exist. You wouldn't be able to earn a single euro anymore, because without the fans you would not be able to attract advertizing. The DFB doesn't take this fact seriously. They think they can compensate by attracting spectators who are into events; people who would go to football one day, handball the next and to the opera the day after that. You've been able to observe this at national team games for the past several years. The atmosphere is staged, as DFB workers attempt to whip-up enthusiasm. However, whenever a match is close, the supporters of the German national team will always be out-sung by the fans of their opponents. That's because what's behind the national team's \"fan club\" is a highly commercialized aparatus that decides who gets into the stadium and how. This has nothing to do with fan culture. Let's talk more about the commercial side of things. The fans are also upset about the introduction of friendlies between Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest sides and China's under-20 team. A meeting between the DFB and the fans was canceled because, according to the fans, the DFB refused to allow journalists to be present. Does this not demonstrate that the differences between the two sides are nearly impossible to overcome? The gap is so great because their basic positions are so far apart and there's no real attempt to mediate. Instead, they isolate themselves from each other. Journalism would be a great vehicle to find out: What is the fan thinking? How did fan culture develop into what it is today? Why is it different here from those in Spain, Italy or England? The DFB's general line is pretty well known, but a fundamental understanding does not exist. That's why there are these turf wars, both sides dig their heels in instead of opening up to each other. Another bone of contention in recent weeks has been the implementation of VAR (video assistant referees). The way decisions are being made is utterly opaque for the fans. Is this causing further alienation between the fans and the DFB? I think the system has failed so far,making football more complicated and opaque. You can't say that the fans are being played-off against the executives, but it certainly does not serve to highlight football at its core. Technology is pumped in from outside and then it takes a couple of minutes to find out: Was it a foul or not? Was it a goal or not? That is a killer for the atmosphere in a sport that lives on spontaneity. So even wrong decisions contribute to the atmposphere and the emotions. This is being reduced to some extent. Do you think football as we know it is in the process of dying? (Laughs) That's too extreme. But what you can say is that for years, football has been undergoing some very rapid changes. Depending on your position, you can see this as a good or bad thing. From the point of view of an economist, I would say football has turned into a wonderful business, and many people make a lot of money out of it. On the other hand, if you look at it from the perspective of the real fans who have deep ties to their club through tradition, their city or their region, they have lost a great deal, as others earn a lot of money using the object of their identity, their emotions and their commitment. They feel massively betrayed. That is the breeding ground for protests, but also for conflicts. Professor Harald Lange is the head of sports science at the University of W\u00fcrzburg. He is an avid football fan and he established Germany's first institute for fan culture in 2012.",

"story": "UN criticizes Israel over Gaza bombing A United Nations investigation into attacks by Israeli forces on UN installations during the Gaza war four months ago has strongly criticized Israel for gross negligence and recklessness. The report, produced by a four-member inquiry board appointed by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, found that the Israeli army failed to protect UN personnel and civilians sheltering in UN buildings. Israel has rejected the report as one-sided and biased. The UN inquiry led by Briton Ian Martin, a former head of rights group Amnesty International who later joined the United Nations, investigated nine incidents of damage to UN property. It found Israel to blame in six incidents when people sheltering in UN buildings were killed or injured. Report highlights Jabalia incident The report highlighted the firing of artillery shells near a UN-run school in Jabalia where Palestinians had sought refuge on January 6. Seven people were wounded inside the school, but an estimated 30-40 people were killed nearby. In several cases, the report found Israel had \"breached the inviolability of United Nations premises,\" had not respected UN immunity and was responsible for deaths and injuries. The board of inquiry also criticized Israel's use of white phosphorus shells which the UN says damaged the UN's main food warehouse in Gaza. The UN report says the Israeli military took \"inadequate\" precautions to protect UN premises and civilians inside and recommends further investigation into possible war crimes. Israel rejects allegations Israel's deputy UN ambassador, Daniel Carmon, called the report one-sided and unfair. \"We were really shocked to see a report where the board is limiting itself to the facts of the damages only, ignoring the context, ignoring that there is war against terrorism,\" he told Reuters. UN Chief Ban Ki-moon said he would seek compensation from Israel for damage to UN property, estimated at more than $11 million, but would not follow the panel's call for further investigations.",

"story": "Hotel offers a year of free beer to unidentified Dortmund hero There's no love lost between football teams Schalke 04 and Borussia Dortmund. But now there seems to be a prank war on between the two sides' fans: one with potentially mouth-watering rewards. A hotel bar in the western German city of Dortmund has offered a year's worth of free beer to an unknown fan of the Borussia Dortmund soccer team. According to a report in the German tabloid Bild, an unidentified man climbed to the top of archrival team Schalke's stadium - currently under construction - where he placed the Dortmund flag. \"This act must be rewarded,\" said Christoph Andruszewski of the Hotel Specht in Dortmund, referring to the desecration of the Veltins Arena in Gelsenkirchen. \"Our hotel is a meeting place for Borussia fans, so we are offering the unknown hero free beer for a year and a box seat in front of our projection screen,\" he told the paper. Bild has offered to act as a go-between, putting the Dortmund hero in contact with the bar if he or she can prove he put up the flag. Meanwhile, former Dortmund player and fan liaison Alfred \"Aki\" Schmidt is convinced that the flag attack was an act of revenge. In 2006, a 41-meter (135-foot) Dortmund banner went missing, allegedly stolen by Schalke fans. The case remains unsolved even to this day. Author: David Levitz Editor: Sean Sinico",

"story": "Typhoon Soudelor hits China's east coast after lashing Taiwan Typhoon Soudelor has killed at least 12 people on the Chinese mainland and caused major flight disruptions. Earlier, the storm cost six lives and injured hundreds of people in Taiwan. Typhoon Soudelor slammed into the east coast of China late on Saturday, causing a number of deaths as high winds and heavy rain battered the region. The typhoon, which earlier caused widespread devastation in Taiwan, was downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved inland from Fujian province towards the neigboring provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangxi on Sunday. At least 12 people were killed and five reported missing in the city of Hangzhou in Zhejiang amid torrential rain and strong winds that knocked down trees and caused flash floods and mudslides, according to AFP news agency, quoting state media. Some 250,000 people were evacuated from their homes along the coast in Fujian and Zhejiang ahead of the typhoon's arrival, while state-run news agency Xinhua said more than 530 flights were canceled and two million households suffered power outages. Wencheng county saw 645 millimeters (25.4 inches) of rain in 24 hours - the most recorded in a century - after the typhoon made landfall Saturday night, Xinhua news agency reporterd. Devastation in Taiwan In Taiwan, where authorities say the typhoon caused at least six deaths and injured nearly 400 people on Saturday, a typhoon warning has been lifted as weather conditions ease. However, the Central Weather Bureau warned of further heavy rains in the south as emergency teams began clearing up the damage. More than 4 million households lost electricity due to the storm, and more than 500 flights were canceled or delayed. Typhoons are common in the South China Sea and Pacific at this time of year, deriving their power from the warm waters before unleashing it on the land in the form of winds and torrential rain. tj/jlw (AFP, Reuters, AP)",

"story": "Sarkozy leads VE Day ceremony in Paris In one of his final official duties before he hands over power to Francois Hollande, outgoing French President Nicolas Sarkozy has lead commemorations in Paris marking the end of World War II in Europe. French President Nicolas Sarkozy laid a wreath Tuesday at the statue of Charles de Gaulle, to begin VE Day celebrations in the French capital Paris. Known around the world as VE Day, the 8th of May marks the surrender by Germany to Allied forces 67 years ago at the end of World War II. In what is set to be one of the final official ceremonies of his single five year term, Sarkozy then inspected French troops at the Arc de Triomphe war memorial. The Arc de Triomphe has a special significance for World War II since Adolf Hitler marched his Nazi troops through the iconic monument when Germany took over France in 1940. \"Issues that unite us all\" In his first official function since winning the election on Sunday, President-elect Francoise Hollande then joined Sarkozy at the Arc de Triomphe to take part in a wreath laying ceremony for World War I veterans. Sarkozy and Hollande stood side-by-side as a military band played the Marseillaise and the Chant des Partisans, the anthem of the French Resistance, before both shook hands with veterans. \"There are issues that unite us all, beyond the person of Nicolas Sarkozy or of me,\" Hollande told journalists in a brief statement after the ceremony. The 57-year-old Socialist won elections on Sunday, ousting right-winger Sarkozy, and is due to take office formally on May 15. al/mz (AP, AFP)",

"story": "Press review: 'American god of arms insatiable' Following the mass shooting at a Connecticut primary school, most commentators in Europe agree that stricter gun laws are necessary in the United States. But they also agree that such changes are unlikely to happen soon. \"The American god of arms is insatiable,\" the Italian newspaper La Repubblica wrote, referring to the latest massacre in the United States: the shooting of 20 children and six adults at a primary school in Newtown in Connecticut. A \"shocking and horrifying\" event, according to The Guardian. \"The time and the place of these massacres inevitably catch us unawares.\" But, the British newspaper continued: \"The fact that another mass shooting has occurred is not shocking, any more than the last one was, or the next one will be.\" Americans, the Guardian wrote, \"are no more prone to mental illness or violence than any other people in the world. What they do have is more guns: roughly, 90 for every 100 people.\" And regions and states with higher rates of gun ownership have higher rates of homicides, the newspaper stressed. The London-based Economist agreed and drew the conclusion that the only effective gun control is \"no guns.\" For \"having few guns means that few people get shot.\" The Economist made a comparison with Great Britain where, following \"a couple of horrible mass shootings, handguns have been effectively banned.\" Firearms-ownership is onerous, involving a lot of paperwork, the Economist explained, and it's hard to get ammunition. The result: \"In 2008-2009, there were 39 fatal injuries from crimes involving firearms in England and Wales...In America, there were 12,000 gun-related homicides in 2008.\" \u201cIn the aftermath of every shooting, the debate (on more restrictive gun laws) reignites, but little will happen,\" the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung lamented while pointing to the influence of the National Rifle Association (NRA), a \"powerful weapons' lobby.\" In order to safeguard its economic interests, the NRA \"frames the possession of weapons as a cultural singularity, which needs to be saved and defended.\" And kind of reform or criticism of existing laws \"is branded by the NRA as attack on civil liberties,\" the paper opined. The French newspaper Le Monde pointed out the fact that US President Barack Obama is unable to push for stricter laws without the support of Congress: \"Up to now, Republican opposition to federal laws regulating the sale of arms has made reforms impossible.\" Spain's El Mundo editorialized that the \"'inculture' of violence\" is deeply engrained in American society \"and fed by the arms' lobby which, let us be clear, has bought off three-quarters of the North American Congress, including a good handful of Democrats.\" The NRA is investing more money than ever, the newspaper wrote. \"The 'gunpowder lobby's' guns are well oiled and for nothing in the world would they allow that laws that aim to strengthen the control of arms turn into a hot topic.\" El Mundo ended with the bleak conclusion that \"nothing is going to change.\"",

"story": "European Film Awards dominated by political themes British director Stephen Daldry and Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgard were among the celebrities attending the 28th annual European Film Awards. But British actor Sir Michael Caine was the superstar of the night. Attended by more than 900 guests from the European film industry, the red carpets were rolled out in Berlin on Saturday for the 28th annual European Film Awards (EFA). Hosted at the Haus der Berliner Festspiele, the European Film Awards (EFA) came to the German capital for the 16th time. The award ceremony opened with a piece of music described by German presenter Thomas Hermmans as the oldest piece of written music - a tune from ancient Syria. It followed on the heels of Charlie Chaplin's famous \"I don't want to be an emperor\" speech from his 1940 film \"The Great Dictator,\" setting the scene for the political undertones to be expected for the evening. EFA chief executive Agnieszka Holland later said that the awards ceremony took place amid deep concern that she felt about Europe. \"I spent a big part of my life in totalitarian regimes. I don't want them to return. The films we make cannot be separated from the world we live in. Our duty is again to defend freedom and democracy,\" Holland said. German actor Daniel Br\u00fchl also took to the stage later in the evening - not to present an award but to highlight the political challenges faced by people in the film industry, focusing on Ukrainian director Oleg Sensov, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for Russian allegations saying he had supported terrorist networks. A total of 52 films from 36 countries were nominated by the European Film Academy. And the winners are\u2026 The Italian comedy \"Youth\" won the \"European Film 2015\" award. Featuring Sir Michael Caine, Harvey Keitel, Rachel Weisz and Jane Fonda, the movie follows a number of retired friends, who travel to the Swiss Alps, where they are compelled by a series of events to reflect about themes of youth and aging. The award for the best documentary was presented to the British film director Asif Kapadia for his film \"Amy\" based on the life of singer Amy Winehouse. The European Discovery Award, given to promising debuts in the film industry, was awarded to the movie \"Mustang\" by Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven, who dedicated her award to Can D\u00fcndar - a recently incarcerated Turkish journalist. The European Cinematographer Award, presented in memory of Italian cinematographer Carlo di Palma each year, went to Martin Gschlacht for his work on the horror movie \"Ich Seh Ich Seh\" (distributed internationally under the title \"Goodnight Mommy\"). The European Short Film Awards, presented by Romanian actress Ana Ularu went to Croatian director Jure Pavlovic and his film \"Picnic.\" Honorary Awards Several of the winners had already been announced ahead of the event, including British actor Sir Michael Caine, who was presented with the Honorary Award of the European Film Academy President and Board. According to the European Film Awards, Caine has provided \"some of cinema's most unforgettable experiences\" throughout his career, which has spanned over six decades to date. EFA President Wim Wenders and EFA chief executive Agnieszka Holland stressed that the award to Cain had been \"long overdue.\" Wenders added that it was \"a sheer pleasure to present this award\" to Michael Caine. Caine also won the award for European Actor, taking to the stage three times in total. \"It's been 50 years, and I've never won an award in Europe. And now I've won two in one evening,\" he said. British actress Charlotte Rampling was also presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award. The 69-year- old actress said that she was proud of the award, as the European film industry played an important role in her life. \"I grew up in Europe. I never planned to go to Hollywood. Europe is my motor, it's my language,\" Rampling said, before receiving her award from French director Francois Ozon. Later in the evening, Rampling garnered another award as \"European Actress.\" Austrian Actor Christoph Waltz was also given an honorary award for European Achievement in World Cinema. Next year, the European Film Awards will take place in European Culture Capital 2016, Wroclaw. \u3000",

"story": "Walmart to raise wages for over 1 million workers More than 85 percent of Walmart's workforce can expect a wage hike next month as the US' largest private employer steps up efforts to polish its image in the wake of fierce criticism from labor activists. The retail titan - the biggest in the world - announced that over 1.2 million of its employees would be paid at least $10 (9.2 euros) an hour, instead of the current minimum of $9, come February 20. The move, which Walmart hailed as \"one of the largest single-day, private-sector pay increases ever,\" comes just a year after the chain raised base wages for 500,000 workers to $9 an hour. However, that did not go down well with everyone. Long-time employees complained that less-experienced newcomers were all of a sudden earning almost the same as they were. \"We did hear from some associates who did feel left out last time,\" spokesman Kory Lundberg acknowledged. Across-the-board hikes But this time around, Walmart does not expect similar complaints. First, new entry level workers hired after January 1, 2016, will start at $9 per hour, before moving up to at least $10 an hour after having completed a six-month training program. Second, those already making more than $10 an hour would receive an annual pay increase \"rather than waiting until their anniversary date,\" the company said. And last but not least, it added, top-level hourly employees would see the minimum wage rise by $2 an hour to $15. As a result, the average full-time hourly wage at one of Walmart's more than 5,000 US stores will be $13.38, up from $13. For part-time workers, the hourly wage will be $10.58, up from $10. While this is above the national hourly average of $9.26 for cashiers and low level retail staff, it is still below the $14.95 average hourly retail workers in a non-supervisory role earn, according to US government data. On top of the raise, full-time hourly workers would also receive free, basic short-term disability, the retailer said. Moreover, employees who have earned paid time off will no longer have to wait a year before they can make use of them. Not entirely unselfish? Walmart had already warned last October that earnings for the year, starting next month, could be down as much as 12 percent due to the workforce investment. But the company said it is a price it is willing to pay. \"We are very clear that if we make sure our associates are being treated fairly, if they are rewarded simply and clearly, we will have a better business,\" said Judith McKenna, chief operating officer for Walmart's US division. But some say Walmart's move may not be completely unselfish. \"The competition for talent is strong,\" said Craig Rowley, global leader of consultancy Hay Group's retail practice. \"It's strong because there are fewer people to hire.\" According to Rowley, the turnover rate - the share of part-time workers who leave within a year - is now 67 percent for the retail industry, up from 50 percent during the recession. pad/hg (AP, AFP)",

"story": "Poland's Tusk and Italy's Mogherini picked for EU top jobs EU leaders meeting in Brussels have chosen Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk as the new European Council president. Italy\u2019s Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini will head the bloc's diplomatic relations. On Saturday, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy (center in photo) announced on Twitter that EU leaders had chosen Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk (left) to succeed him and Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini (right) to take over from Catherine Ashton as the bloc's new top diplomat. It had been expected that the EU leaders who gathered in Brussels on Saturday would agree on key appointments to the bloc. \"Elected,\" Van Rompuy wrote on Twitter. \"The European Council has elected PM Donald Tusk as the next president of the European Council and Euro Summits.\" And, then, shortly thereafter: Tusk said it was possible to combine austerity and expansion in Europe. \"My experience as prime minister points to the fact that fiscal discipline on one side and economic growth on the other, combining these two challenges is possible,\" Tusk told a news conference in Brussels. The 57-year-old career politician also said he would take on Britain's concerns over the EU: \"No reasonable person can imagine the EU without the UK,\" he said. For his own country, Tusk said his appointment was a strong signal for Poland's future in the Eurozone, although the date and the final decision would be decided by the government in Poland. Mogherini has been Italy's top diplomat since February. The 41-year-old center-left politician said she would work to promote European projects on the international stage: \"We are a dream come true, having to be careful that the dream doesn't turn into a nightmare,\" she said. Mogherini takes up her five-year posting in November. mkg,jm/jr (AFP, dpa, AP)",

"story": "European drought impacts people and environment It's official: Europe experienced a severe drought this summer. DW looks at the key points of a new analysis reflecting impacts of high temperatures and low rainfall on the environment and people. It's official: Europe suffered a severe drought in June and July of 2015. This is according to the European Drought Observatory's analysis of data through the end of July. Not only did virtually the entire European continent see a shortage of rainfall this summer, but it also experienced \"thermal anomalies\" in July - that is, heat waves that were hotter and longer than average. The drought had a number of consequences for people and the environment. High heat caused soils to dry out, also drying out plants. This facilitated the spread of wildfires, like this one in Greece. The impact of the lack of rain and high temperatures could be felt across many sectors. Agricultural production was reduced, and forests dried out and became more susceptible to insect attacks. Hydropower production decreased, rivers fell to record low levels, and inland water transport was completely shut down in some places. Tourism, however, was boosted - along with \"open-air\" activities, the observatory noted. The conditions allowed certain grape varieties to flourish, and of course benefited solar energy. The joint research project presented the analysis in its Drought News August 2015 publication. Although low rainfall and high temperatures were present across many European regions, France, Germany, Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Benelux block, northern Italy and northern Spain experienced exceptionally hot and dry conditions. In these areas in June and July, it was warmer than 30 degrees Celsius for 30 days - while Spain (pictured below) saw 40 days over that temperature.",

"story": "Best of Bundesliga: Premier League pair make their mark, Bayern stretch lead The Bundesliga's 21st matchday brought the familiar sight of Bayern Munich extending their lead. But there was also room for something new, with Premier League pair Michy Batshuayi and Ademola Lookman shining on debut. Good week for: Premier League loanees, RB Leipzig, Werder Bremen Bad week for: Goalkeepers, Cologne, Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach Best bits: - Ademola Lookman (top) became the first Englishman to score in the Bundesliga for almost 13 years, with Bayern Munich's Owen Hargreaves the last to achieve the feat - also against Gladbach. The 20-year-old Everton loanee's solo effort saw RB Leipzig past Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach and also helped his club to reach 100 points in their short Bundesliga history. - Michy Batshuayi made a dream start to his Borussia Dortmund career with two goals and an assist in a 3-2 win over Cologne. Coach Peter St\u00f6ger was under added pressure on his return to the club he coached for four years, following the departure of reigning Bundesliga top scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. He needn't have feared, as the Belgian striker chose the perfect time to show why Chelsea paid Marseille \u20ac38m to sign him two summers ago. - After that loss, it is now mathematically impossible for Cologne to win the league. There's always next year! Well, maybe... - Werder Bremen's Sebastian Langkamp made one of the shortest debuts in history. The former Hertha Berlin defender came on for nine seconds of his new side's 2-1 win over Schalke. That crucial victory came on Bremen's 119th birthday. - Thomas M\u00fcller brought up his 300th win as a Bayern player, after just 419 games. Their victory and slips ups from Schalke, Bayer Leverkusen and Eintracht Frankfurt means they are 18 points clear at the top. The Bavarians are on course to beat their 2014 record for the earliest title victory (Matchday 27) and the largest ever gap between first and second (currently 25 points in 2012/13). The most they'll need is seven wins from the remaining 13 games. Best Quotes - \"He was lucky I didn't take him off again, he only brought one pair of boots with him from England and he was sliding around all over the pitch.\" Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl on Leipzig's new boy and matchwinner Ademola Lookman. \"These things happen, it just looks stupid because he is the last man. We all made mistakes on the pitch today.\" Werder Bremen forward Max Kruse comes to the backing of his goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka after his gaffe (see Bizarre Bundesliga). \"Bremen got back into the game after my mistake and I\u2019m really sorry to the team for that \u2013 I can only apologise.\" - Schalke goalkeeper Ralf F\u00e4hrmann doesn't let himself off quite so easily. - \"It's not so good for us, because we have a home game and can not take advantage of 20 minutes. We need the support of the fans, especially against opponents who are at eye level with us.\" Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach's Matthias Ginter after Gladbach's fans were largely silent for the first 19 minutes in a protest against Red Bull's involvement with RB Leipzig. \"We were knackered by the end. The pitch played it's part there.\" Mats Hummels, after returning to the Bayern Munich side after a four game absence. \"Daniel Opare has repeatedly lied to us, consciously and despite being confronted with the facts,\" Augsburg sporting director Stefan Reuter after the club released first teamer Daniel Opare on Saturday. Injuries and suspensions Hoffenheim must do without midfielder Kerem Demirbay for several weeks due to an ankle injury picked up in Saturday's 1-1 draw at Hertha Berlin. Mario G\u00f6tze missed Dortmund's Friday night win with a back complaint. It's unclear how long it will keep him out. Schalke will be without Matija Nastasic for their trip to runaway leaders Bayern Munich next Saturday. The Serbian defender is suspended after seeing red during his side's defeat to Werder Bremen. Hamburg's Kyriakos Papadopoulos will also miss next week's match away at Borussia Dortmund after he was sent off for a pair of yellow card offences in the 1-1 draw with Hannover. Bizarre Bundesliga Werder Bremen's win over Schalke was one to forget for both men between the sticks. First Bremen's Jiri Pavlenka allowed Yevhen Konoplyanka's speculative effort to slip through his fingers. Then Schalke stopper Ralf F\u00e4hrmann made him feel a little better after fumbling a simple catch in to the path of Max Kruse, before being nutmegged as Bremen grabbed a late winner through Zlatko Junuzovic.",

"story": "European Press Review: Where is the U.S. in the Middle East? European newspapers on Wednesday lamented the recent surge in violence in the Middle East and called on the U.S. to play a pivotal role in stopping it. Just one week after Israeli and Palestinian leaders at the historic Aqaba Summit pledged to work towards peace, the situation in the Middle East again spiraled out of control as violence erupted. On Wednesday, a suicide bomb detonated in Jerusalem, killing 16 people and injuring 80. Israeli troops retaliated in the Gaza Strip, killing 9 suspected members of the Hamas organization. European newspapers, commenting on the never-ending violence, said it is time for the United States to take a more active role in bringing about peace in the region. It is now up to U.S. President George W. Bush, as Italy\u2019s Il Messaggero put it, to take the initiative and make the next move. Condemnation and expressions of shock are no longer enough, the paper warned. De Volkskrant from the Netherlands wondered how far Bush will go if Sharon stays on his collision course. It will not be enough, the paper maintained, merely to urge both sides to stick to the peace plan. Britain\u2019s The Independent noted that the aim of Hamas is to provoke Israel at every turn\u2014and sadly, they have once again succeeded. But the Israeli actions, the paper continued, will not succeed in suppressing the terrorists and securing national security \u2013 they never have, and they never will. The cycle of violence in the region seems set to resume, the paper lamented. It also said the United States should play a pivotal role, and that President Bush must use all his country\u2019s political and financial leverage to keep Sharon on the road map to peace. The editors for Liberation from France were of the same opinion. President Bush should not hesitate to exert more pressure on Israel. The U.S. President must, the paper wrote, force Israeli Prime Minister Sharon to hold back despite further Palestinian bombing attacks. And, the paper added, Bush must apply pressure to the Arab world to throw its entire political weight behind Palestinian Prime Minister Abbas\u2019 government, and oppose armed groups. The Daily Mirror also regarded Sharon as the stumbling block on the road to peace. The London tabloid said President Bush is faced with two choices: He must now decide whether he wants to give up his peace plan or take the obvious alternative step, and demand a change in the Israeli leadership to bring the peace he and the rest of the world want. Austria\u2019s Kurier turned its attention to the situation in Afghanistan following the latest attack on German troops there. For a year now, the paper noted, Hamid Karzai has sat in the President\u2019s palace, surrounded by U.S. bodyguards\u2014but his influence hardly reaches further than the city limits. But even in the capital, one is not entirely safe. If there is an attack, the paper said, western politicians are quick to point a finger at al Qaeda. Observers believe this is meant to calm people, but what is reassuring about the idea, the paper wondered, if the enemies are still alive and kicking?",

"story": "Moscow and Ankara fueling the fire from downed plane Turkish President Erdogan said he wanted to talk \"face to face\" with Russia's Putin about the downing of the Russian plane. The two countries continue to trade blame, with Moscow preparing to retaliate economically. The deadly incident was an \"automatic response to the airspace violation,\" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a speech on Friday. \"Turkey did not deliberately [shoot] down the Russian warplane,\" he said. Ankara says that the bomber entered Turkish airspace and ignored multiple warnings, while Moscow says that the Turkish forces fired at the aircraft above Syria, without warning. Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused Ankara of a \"planned provocation,\" and a \"stab in the back.\" On Friday, Erdogan described Putin's criticism as \"unacceptable\" and asked Russia to prove its \"grave and unfair\" accusations. Erdogan calling for a Paris meet The Turkish president also blamed the Kremlin for backing the regime of \"murderer\" President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, likening this to \"playing with fire.\" Speaking to his supporters in northeast Turkey, Erdogan said he \"would like to meet [Putin] face to face in Paris,\" during the upcoming climate meet. \"There is a summit in Paris, I believe he will also attend. We could sit and talk there,\" Erdogan said. \"I would like to bring the issue to a reasonable point. We are disturbed that the issue has been escalated.\" 'Simply apologize' The Kremlin has received Erdogan's request, said Putin's spokesman Dmitri Peskov. However, Peskov did not clarify whether Moscow had accepted or refused the offer. \"The president has been told about this request... That's all I can say,\" he told reporters. Putin had refused Erdogan's earlier attempts at contact, because Turkey was not ready to apologize, according to Putin's aide Yuri Ushakov. \"We see Turkey's unwillingness to simply apologize for the incident with the plane,\" Ushakov told reporters. Also on Friday, the Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said that Moscow has decided to suspend visa-free travel with Turkey, in addition to economic retaliatory measures. Ankara \"risks putting Turkey in a most severe situation, with respect to both its long-term national interests and the situation in the region,\" according to Lavrov. \"We believe that the Turkish leadership has crossed the line of what is acceptable,\" he said. Assad and 'IS' to profit Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu called for unity against the \"Islamic State\" and argued that the shooting of the plane was not directed at Russia. \"The downing of an unidentified jet in Turkish airspace was not - and is not - an act against a specific country,\" he wrote in an article published in the Friday edition of The Times of London. \"The international community must not turn on itself. Otherwise the only victors will be Daesh... and the Syrian regime,\" he said, using an Arabic term for IS jihadists. dj/msh (AFP, AP, Reuters)",

"story": "Probe blames Cypriot president for deadly munitions blast An official investigation into a deadly blast on Cyprus which killed 13 people and badly damaged the country's economy has found the Cypriot president bore \"serious\" personal responsibility for the incident. The president of Cyprus was blamed Monday by an official investigator for negligence leading to a huge explosion that killed 13 people in July. The blast triggered a government crisis and led to talk that the island may need an EU bailout. Speaking on national television, investigator Polys Polyviou told a news conference that President Demetris Christofias bore a \"serious and very heavy personal responsibility\" for the accident. The explosion occurred when nearly 100 containers of seized Iranian munitions being stored at the Evangelos Florakis Naval base in Mari blew up. The explosion severely damaged a nearby major power plant, causing electricity shortages to about half the country. Experts predicted it would take at least one year to fix at a cost of more than 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion). Polyviou said the manner in which the decaying munitions were stored was \"completely irresponsible,\" adding that the president was responsible for allowing and keeping the cargo in Cyprus and for approving its storage near the base. Unexpected result The outcome of the probe was surprising considering it had been ordered by Christofias himself. Many had expected the inquiry to clear the head of state of any wrongdoing. Cyprus's defense and foreign ministers have already resigned over the affair. Christofias, meanwhile, has rejected responsibility for the explosion. The crisis sparked rounds of protests outside the presidential palace in which thousands were calling for the president to step down. 'Making a stand' The issue has dominated headlines on the divided island for months. There's been a lot of interest in the case because so many people were affected by it. \"It's a very small island, so lots of people were close to the explosion and saw the knock on effects of it,\" pointed out Chris Yearley, a journalist at the local English-language daily Famagusta Gazette. Yearley said there was a sense of surprise across the island that the finger of blame has been pointed so clearly at the president. \"I think that when we discovered that the president had arranged for the investigation to take place, we were expecting for him to come off scot-free. That hasn't happened, and personally, I'm quite shocked by this and it will be interesting to see what happens next.\" Many commentators predict Christofias will stand down before the end of the year.

"story": "Berlin first in Germany to scrap child day care fees A sociopolitical landmark for Berlin's parents: Starting in August all municipal day care centers in the German capital will be free. Several other states are also looking to phase out the costs for working parents. Berlin's regional government announced Monday that, beginning next month, parents will no longer have to pay any fees to place their children in municipal day care centers. From August 1, childcare centers in the German capital will be free of charge, including for children under the age of one. Berlin's state government began phasing out childcare fees for other age groups in 2007. However, parents with children across all age groups \u2014 from ages zero to six \u2014 will still have to pay for food in daycare centers. \"For many Berlin families it makes a big difference whether or not they have to pay contributions to the day care center,\" said Sandra Scheeres, Berlin's Social Democratic (SPD) Senator for Education, Youth and Family. \"The free day care center for all means a noticeable financial relief for many parents. Childcare facilities are educational institutions, and education must be free of charge.\" Germany's federal minister for family affairs, Franziska Giffey (SPD), has indicated she wants to see more day care centers in Germany gradually phase out fees. The government has announced plans to inject some \u20ac3.5 billion ($4.1 billion) into childcare services over the next four years. No equality when it comes to nurseries The new legislation makes Berlin the first state to completely abolish fees for municipal day care centers. Some 15,800 children below the age of one are set to benefit. Contributions by parents for the 2017-18 school year totaled around \u20ac7 million. Berlin, one of Germany's three city-states along with Hamburg and Bremen, remains the vanguard in Germany when it comes to scrapping childcare fees. Read more: Germany's wage gap also a regional issue Parents in around one-third of German states still have no exemptions from childcare fees, while other state governments have either subsidized or completely lifted fees for certain age groups. In Rhineland-Palatinate, for example, children from the age of two have been exempt from contributions since 2010, while in Lower Saxony and Hesse children from age three will be exempt from fees starting next month. However, other states continue to charge hundreds of euros per month for childcare, often putting mothers off from from returning to work after giving birth. The state with the dearest day care costs is Schleswig-Holstein, where a place in a municipal nursery can cost up to 9 percent of household income. It's followed by Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Saarland, which charge 8.2 percent and 7.5 percent of household income respectively.

"story": "Opinion: A disgrace for Europe An incapable government in Athens, and unhelpful Europeans. The fire on Lesbos shows: It's not just a refugee camp in ruins, but also the EU's entire refugee policy, says Bernd Riegert. If it was an act of arson on the refugee camp in Moria on Lesbos, then it must be denounced. The perpetrators must be punished. But the aid organizations and the health authorities in Greece have long been warning us that the overcrowded \"hot spot\" camps are ticking time bombs. It was just a question of when the untenable circumstances there would lead to an explosion of violence and chaos. The European Union's restrictive refugee policy has resulted in migrants being held at registration camps on the Greek islands. Most of the migrants are destined to be deported to Turkey. They wait in deplorable conditions while their asylum applications are processed - something that, contrary to the original plans, can take months. The Greek government and the EU are unable to organize a quick, orderly, and humanitarian process. Still waiting for promised solutions It's a disgrace for the extreme left-right coalition in Athens, but it's also a disgrace for all the EU heads of state and government, who promised to resolve the refugee crisis following the deal agreed with Turkey in March. Around 60,000 migrants are stuck in Greece. The EU continues to send money to the Greek government, but officials there seem unable to accept the assistance and organize proper accommodation and a better registration process for refugees. Other member states promised to send people to help out at the camps in Greece, but only a small number are actually being deployed at the \"hot spots.\" At the same time, the redistribution of asylum seekers from Greece and Italy to other EU states is repeatedly being blocked and pushed aside. Over the summer months, the EU made a concerted effort to look the other way when it came to refugees and migrants. And yet it's not just in Greece that the camps are overflowing. The same thing is happening in Calais in France, along the French-Italian border and the Swiss-Italian border. Along the Balkan route, desperate migrants continue to form unofficial camps. It's not just in Greece that the official registration centers have reached capacity; the same is happening in Italy, where, for purely geographical reasons, it's not as easy to restrict people's movements as on a Greek island. They move northward in the vague hope of somehow reaching Germany or the United Kingdom. No change in Italy In Italy, the number of new arrivals via the Libya route is almost the same as last year. Every week, thousands are rescued from the Mediterranean. And thousands have also drowned this year - more than ever before. One out of 89 migrants will drown on the way to Europe. Last year, it was one out of 276. The Mediterranean has become a mass grave. That's also a disgrace. It's a disgrace for the EU's humanitarian values, and yet something that no one seems to get upset about anymore. A veil of silence has fallen over these daily tragedies. Interest is only stirred when, as is now the case in Moria, we are once again confronted with aberrations and terrible images of violence and fire. Our politicians are ducking their heads, acting as if they have the refugee crisis under control, but they don't. On a European level, there's no sense that \"we can do this.\" The only things that are more effective now are the deterrents keeping migrants from setting out, and the closure of our borders. The processes for asylum application and for a fair distribution of migrants in Europe are just as badly organized as they were a year ago when Chancellor Angela Merkel first uttered her now famous catchphrase. It's a phrase she now likely regrets, for a multitude of reasons. The EU hasn't managed to take control of the refugee crisis. Moria is the latest sad symbol of that failure.

"story": "Banking on fortified flour in Nairobi Muguika Kaburu manufactures fortified flour for people with special dietary requirements. A former banker, he's convinced he's found a niche market with excellent growth prospects. It was merely by coincidence that 60-year-old entrepreneur Muguika Kaburu ended up in the food business. He used to work in banking but in 2007 was given the chance to do research on fortified foods for an international aid organization. He was then appointed as a distributer for extruder machines that are used in the manufacture of fortified flour. He took the opportunity to buy a second-hand machine for himself at a cost of two million Kenyan shillings ( $25,000, 18,000 euros ). Kaburu's company Prosoya Kenya produces high fiber cereal flour fortified with vitamins. It is mixed with water and heated and then ready to eat as nutritional porridge. Initially his chief clients were hospitals, schools and orphanages, but now he is entering the retail market. Secret of success The company is only three years old and has been doubling its sales annually. Projected sales for 2017 are 4.8 billion Kenyan shillings. \"Our future plan is to get in the whole of Africa with fortified products,\" he told DW. Malnutrition is high in Africa and there is a demand for inexpensive food. Kaburu wants his son Kinoti to take over the business when he retires. Like his father, Kinoti is a banker by profession, having worked for Barclays before leaving to join his father's company. In a recent inteview with local media, Kaburu senior revealed the secret of his success as an entrepreneur. You have to take care of three groups, he said, \"your products, your customers and your staff - then you are home and dry.\"",

"story": "Globetrotting Behind Bars Traveling around the globe for a year and visiting 60 countries along the way might be a dream for many. But the \"hotels\" Jan de Cock stayed at during his trip would surely deter most people: prisons. Spending time in an overcrowded African prison is not something to aspire to. But for de Cock, it was an experience he had dreamt about for a long time. For the past 20 years, the Belgian has been interested in the fate of prisoners, who are often forgotten by the rest of society. \"Let me make clear that I'm for justice and for punishing criminals,\" he said. \"But it's not my right to condemn these men and women, these teenagers and children a second or third time. I want to show these people in a different light. They're people just like us.\" It wasn't easy for de Cock to convince officials to let him stay in a prison for a few days and nights just like regular inmates. It took him three years and hundreds of letters to embassies, ministries and prison directors to prepare for the journey. Sleeping with rats In the end, he received permission to stay at 66 prisons around the globe -- some in democratic countries, others run by dictatorial regimes. \"The first prison I slept at was in Kigali in Ruwanda,\" he said, adding that the prison, which was built for 2,000 inmates, housed 7,000 people. \"I was wedged between fellow inmates,\" he said. \"Below the beds, where I keep my slippers at home, lay three or four more prisoners. I remember that I woke up in the middle of the night because something was crawling through my hair. It was my first encounter with a giant rat.\" Choosing Benin over US De Cock said he does believe that prisons reflect a country's political system. \"You can tell the level of democracy that exists in a country by the way prisoners are dealt with,\" he said, adding that democracies don't always treat their prisoners more humanely. \"If you'd present me with a choice to stay in a clean prison in the US or under miserable conditions as is the case in (Benin's) Coutonou prison, where 250 people share a room built for 50, I think I'd choose the latter,\" he said. \"People keep each other alive if they can be together, even if the situation is horrible.\" Similarities despite regional differences Isolation is the worst kind of punishment, de Cock said, adding that Japan is especially harsh with prisoners. There, inmates are told in which position they have to sleep. They are not allowed to talk. They mustn't look guards in the eye. Scandinavian prisons on the other hand try to prepare prisoners for their re-entry into society. In Latin America, de Cock was surprised by the extreme corruption that exists in prisons there. But despite regional differences, prisoners resemble each other in many ways. \"The thing that hit me most was the extreme sense of abandonment felt by these people,\" he said. \"I remember the case of a women in a prison in Peru, Lima. When she was released after 27 years behind bars, she came back three days later and begged to be readmitted. She didn't know anyone on the outside any more.\" Learning from inmates De Cock heard many similar stories during his visits. In many cases, he was the first person to show any interest in inmates for years, he said. \"The more you enter this world, the more you realize that nice things happen there as well,\" he said. \"You realize that these people that have been condemned by society can teach us something as well -- about trust, about patience and solidarity.\" Trying to share his experiences with others, de Cock has written a book, \"Hotel Prison,\" about his book. He's also planning to continue his journey, he said. \"I'd like to take a look at Guantanamo Bay,\" he said, adding that Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison is also on his list.",

"story": "Australian stock exchange boss steps down The head of Australia's stock exchange resigned Monday amid allegations of bribery at a gambling group he previously ran. Elmer Funke Kupper had been CEO of the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) since October 2011. Funke Kupper has also taken a leave of absence from the board of Tabcorp, Australia's largest bookmaker, which is currently being investigated by the Australian Federal Police. The allegations center on a payment of $151,460 (134,535 euros) to the bookmaker by relatives of Cambodia's Prime Minister Hen Sen. Tabcorp, a publicly listed company, had reportedly been looking to expand into the country. Funke Kupper told the media last week that he had no recollection of such a payment during his four years at the helm of Tabcorp, which said it did not pursue the expansion opportunity in Cambodia. ASX chairman Rick Holliday-Smith said the board \"accepted that Elmer wanted to direct his full focus to the investigations which may be made into the Tabcorp matter - and not have them interfere with the important role of leading the ASX\". A statement by the ASX announced that Rick Holliday-Smith will take over Funke Kupper's duties until a replacement is found. AFP, ASX (hch/bea)",

"story": "Photos show Earth from dark side of the moon New images published by NASA show the Earth's surface from the side of the moon invisible from the planet's surface. The DSCOVR satellite was set into orbit to investigate storms from space. The satellite DSCOVR took photos of the moon crossing in front of the Earth. NASA, the US space agency, has published the stunning images on Wednesday. The spacecraft snapped the pictures from the dark side of the moon from about 1.6 million kilometers (1 million miles) away in mid-July. The Earth's satellite is in a synchronous rotation, meaning the same side of the moon always faces our planet. The first sighting of the lunar rear side was from the Soviet probe Luna 3 in 1959. The Earth-facing side of the moon has large, dark basaltic plains not visible on the far side. The dark side's most remarkable features are the Mare Moscoviense on the upper left and the Tsiolkovskiy crater on the lower left. \"It is surprising how much brighter Earth is than the Moon,\" said Adam Szabo, DSCOVR project scientist, to NASA. \"Our planet is a truly brilliant object in dark space compared to the lunar surface.\" The US aerospace company SpaceX launched the $340 million (300 million euro) observation satellite into space in February. The operation is a joint force between SpaceX and NASA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the US Air Force to explore weather in space and potentially harmful impact on Earth. The spacecraft will serve as an early warning system for solar storms, which are seen as auroras on Earth, but can also cause disruptions to telecommunications. \"DSCOVR\" is an abbreviation for Deep Space Climate Observatory. The mission is scheduled to last five years. kb/sms (AFP, dpa)",

"story": "Turkish guest workers transformed German society In the 1960s, Turkish workers arrived in Germany to fill the demand for cheap labor in a booming post-war economy. Many of them never left, creating a minority community that changed the demographics of Germany forever. Fifty-five years ago, Germany was in need of healthy, unmarried Turkish men to work in the country's booming post-war economy, and Turkey was more than willing to help fill that demand. A treaty signed by the two states on October 30, 1961 established the conditions for the guest workers. The expenses for traveling to Germany were included, but the return trip was not always covered by employers. There had previously been recruitment treaties between Germany and Italy in 1955 as well as with Spain in 1960. After Turkey, treaties were also signed with Morocco, Portugal, Tunisia and Yugoslavia until 1968. Germany needed additional labor for its factories and mines to help fuel the economic miracle driven by the rapid expansion of production after World War II. According to the recruitment treaty, Germany was able - with the support of the Turkish government - to set up a liaison office in Istanbul. The office functioned as a foreign bureau for the German Ministry of Labour through which German companies could fill their demand for workers. Turkish authorities initially screened the applications, pre-selected the candidates and then organized interviews in the German liaison office. For Turkey, the export of large numbers of male Turkish workers to Germany had several advantages. First, the men were well paid in Germany and sent remittances home to their families in Turkey. Second, they obtained further training in Germany and were supposed to bring that knowledge back to Turkey when they returned. Two-year stay The employment of Turkish workers was meant to be for a limited time just like with the Greeks, Italians and Spaniards that had previously come to Germany as guest workers. After two years, the Turkish workers were expected to return home, and then a new group of workers was supposed to be recruited. The goal was to prevent the Turkish guests from becoming immigrants. Originally, the workers were not allowed to bring their families with them. In 1964, the recruitment treaty was changed to allow the Turkish workers to stay for longer than two years. It was too expensive and time-consuming to constantly hire and train replacements. Later, the workers were even allowed to bring their families with them. Land of immigrants An economic recession triggered by the global oil crisis in the early 1970s followed Germany's economic miracle, and in 1973 the recruitment of foreign workers came to a stop altogether. Between 1961 and 1973, around 2.7 million Turks applied for a job in Germany, but only around 750,000 were actually accepted. Half of those who came returned to Turkey, according to estimates. The other half remained in Germany. Today, around 2.5 million people with a Turkish background live in Germany, meaning either they or their parents were born in Turkey, making them the largest migrant group in the country. Around 700,000 Turkish migrants have German citizenship. In contrast to citizens of EU countries, Turks cannot have dual citizenship. If they possess both, they must choose between Turkish and German citizenship by their 23rd birthday. Although the guest workers from Turkey and other countries came to Germany 50 years ago, Germany was only declared a de facto country of immigrants through the passage of new citizenship and immigration laws in 2000 and 2005.

"story": "Online betting firms say they discourage soccer match-fixing As football authorities try to fight the worst scandal ever to hit the sport, gaming operators are coming under scrutiny. But as Deutsche Welle discovered, they could help prevent games from being thrown. Prosecutors in the German city of Bochum certainly have enough to investigate - 200 manipulated matches in nine countries, the Champions League and possibly World Cup qualifiers. Players, referees and even hotel chefs are thought to be involved. The scandal is being called the biggest ever in football, and it comes just four years after German football was rocked by revelations that referee Robert Hoyzer had helped fix professional matches. Against this backdrop, some representatives of state gaming operators have criticized the dramatic growth of the online gambling industry, blaming it for persistent corruption in the sport. Not surprisingly, Internet betting firms disagree with that view. After the Hoyzer scandal, leading gaming operators banded together to form a watchdog, the European Sports Security Association, or ESSA. Industry representatives say the measures taken helped prevent abuses. When the German authorities started to investigate the Hoyzer scandal in 2005, they went to the largest operator at the time, bwin, and asked them how much money they lost,\" ESSA Secretary General Khalid Ali told Deutsche Welle. \"Actually, bwin didn't lose anything. And the reason was that they were online so everything was fully traceable,\" he said, adding that the strict security procedures in place prevented people from coming online and placing large amounts of money on games - in particular on minor games in lower divisions. A spokesman for the large online betting platform Interwetten reaffirmed that assessment. \"We have suffered in the past due to manipulated results, but we haven't been hurt at all by the current scandal,\" Interwetten Sponsoring and Public Relations Manager Michael Summer said. \"That's because we have a risk management system that can block attempts at cheating at an early stages.\" Both Ali and Summer point out that online bookmakers are among those with the most to lose from match-fixing and, conversely, the biggest interest in uncovering instances of cheating. So can football's governing bodies and law-enforcement authorities actually learn from the Internet bookies? Transparency through technology For some people, online gambling is a marriage of something inherently dubious with something inherently seedy, but industry representatives say that impression is wrong. Both ESSA and individual Internet bookmakers monitor the flow of bets. If unusual amounts of money are wagered on a given result, the odds are immediately lowered. In extreme cases, bets are cancelled and football authorities notified about the irregularities. Computer technology increases the transparency. \"All of our customers are identifiable and can't get away with using pseudonyms and false identities more than once or twice,\" Summer said. \"That makes Internet gaming operators far more secure than traditional betting shops.\" Online bookmakers are particularly cautious with games in obscure leagues and lower divisions, where most, if not all, of the current match fixing seems to have taken place. \"People think you can just go online and start betting a lot of money,\" Ali said. \"That's not the case. It might be if you wanted to bet on the Champions League, the Premier League or the Bundesliga first division, but if you go down the leagues, the amount of money you can bet is very limited. In some cases you'd be lucky to be able to put even 50 euros on a match.\" The same, Ali says, is true of so-called provisional bets - for instance, who will pick up a game's first foul or corner kick. The industry asserts that the importance of such wagers, much criticized of late, has been blown out of proportion. \"Provisional or in-play wagers aren't part of the problem at all,\" Summer said. \"These are usually bets on 50-50 outcomes with very low odds and very low limits on the amounts that can be wagered.\" So if match fixers aren't making their ill-gotten gains from Internet bookmakers, how is the money being earned? The real bad guys \"One of the first questions I'd be asking is: Where exactly have these bets been placed?\" Ali said. \"Once UEFA had released the names of the teams involved in the Champions League and Europe League games, we went to our members and did a retroactive search on this. And none of our members found anything suspicious. That's not to say the matches weren't fixed, but it shows that the criminals who were behind this are not putting their bets with the responsible online operators.\" Instead, say industry representatives, the trail leads to Asia and Eastern Europe, where gambling is usually illegal and controlled by the local mafia. That assertion is backed up by research done by British journalist Declan Hill, whose 2008 book \"The Fix\" predicted that the football world was on the verge of a major scandal. \"In Asia, the gambling market is enormous - bigger than Las Vegas and the European bookmakers combined,\" Hill told The New York Times in a recent interview. \"It's huge and most of it is illegal. It's easier to hide a fraud inside a covert, criminal industry.\" Online gaming operators do say more attention needs to be paid to betting exchanges, in which individual gamblers conclude bets with one another. And they say more effective use needs to be made of the information they provide to law-enforcement authorities and football governing bodies. \"Abuses need to be pursued more vigorously,\" Summer said. \"For example, after the Hoyzer affair, we passed on data we had collected to the German Football League, the DFL. But for whatever reason, some of the people behind that match-fixing scandal are the same ones involved in the latest affair. There was a lack of follow-up.\" Most observers are confident that investigators in Bochum are doing a good job trying to shed light on the current scandal. But improved cooperation between law enforcers, football organizations and legitimate bookmakers would help them in their attempt to eradicate match-fixing.

"story": "Rainer Sch\u00fcttler Tastes Victory German tennis can once again dare to dream of taking home a Grand Slam title as Rainer Sch\u00fcttler slams his way into the finals of the Australian Open with a sensational victory over American Andy Roddick. He was supposed to be the rising star on the German tennis horizon, filling in the shoes of the likes of Boris Becker and former Davis Cup captain Michael Stich. And for a while in 1999, it seemed that Rainer Sch\u00fcttler was just the man for a floundering post-Becker German tennis scene. In January 1999, Sch\u00fcttler exploded on to the tennis circuit with a stunning ATP tournament victory in Doha over British player Tim Henman, catapulting him to a world ranking of 66. The German media hailed him as the \"new hope\" and the spectacular win even moved a previously skeptical Becker to remark that, \"others have more talent than him. But Rainer manages to put in much more effort and perform better than other stylish players.\" Spectacular comeback But as the tennis world waited with bated breath for Sch\u00fcttler to deliver after Doha, the German disappointed with a series of uninspiring performances, barely making it beyond the first or second rounds in events including the Davis Cup premiere for Germany in 1999. Sch\u00fcttler was more or less written off after those disasters. But now 26-year-old Sch\u00fcttler has finally filled those expectations, which accompanied him at the start of his shooting-star career three years ago. With a stunning 7:5, 2:6, 6:3, 6:3 win over American Andy Roddick (photo) on Friday, Sch\u00fcttler is now close to emulating German tennis legend Boris Becker's last spectacular Grand Slam win of his career at the Australian Open seven years ago. Germany has not seen a Grand Slam victory since former Wimbledon champion Michael Stich won the French Open title seven years ago, just four months after Becker's coup at the Australian Open. Sch\u00fcttler now becomes the sixth German to enter the finals of a Grand Slam tournament in tennis history. \"I'm speechless, ecstatically happy! It was a dream and I fulfilled it,\" Sch\u00fcttler said after the marathon match that lasted two hours, 19 minutes -- the longest in his career. The game began on an unhappy note for Sch\u00fcttler, who appeared visibly nervous. He lost his serve at the beginning, though recovered soon after to make the 20-year-old Roddick -- who had two marathon five-setters behind him -- scramble after the ball. Sch\u00fcttler also profited from a series of unforced errors from his opponent. With a huge crowd of supporters rooting for him, Sch\u00fcttler clinched the first set after two break points. But he seemed to be out of sorts in the second and lost the set in the face of errors and a weak serve. From the third set on, Sch\u00fcttler regained his characteristic confidence and made Roddick run for the ball and attacked his weak backhand. The strategy paid off. Roddick, who was suffering from a wrist injury, was fair enough not to excuse his defeat with his handicap. \"Rainer played a clever game, absolutely brilliant! He's earned his spot in the finals,\" Roddick said later. Hard-hitting player Sch\u00fcttler, born in 1976, first began playing tennis at 10, hitting balls with his father, a postal worker, on a tennis court in his home city of Korbach in the state of Hessen. For several years, tennis remained just a hobby for the blond Sch\u00fcttler. \"Until the 11th grade, I never thought of becoming a professional player,\" Sch\u00fcttler said in an interview with Tennis Guide in 1998. He was then discovered by coach Dirk Hordoff at a tournament in Hessen and Sch\u00fcttler made rapid progress under his tutelage. Not exactly known as an elegant player, Sch\u00fcttler often relies heavily on his physical prowess to overpower his opponents. He has been working with an athletics trainer for the past six years and with an Iranian tae kwon do world champion for the past two. Sch\u00fcttler is incredibly quick on his feet and almost deceptively simple in his persona on court -- a baseball cap worn backwards is his trademark -- but he also moves about with a huge dose of self-confidence. Asked whether it was a problem for him to be always standing in the shadows of German tennis heavyweights such as Becker, Stich, Haas and Kiefer, Sch\u00fcttler said \"it's normal. The expectations in Germany are always very high.\" Coach Hordoff said that Sch\u00fcttler had transformed his frame of mind on court. \"Earlier,\" he said, \"Rainer was under too much pressure to win, now he just goes out and has fun playing tennis.\" \"He's an absolutely solid guy, a proper German,\" coach Hordoff once told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper in an interview. \"He\u2019s a cautious person who has no silly ideas in his head and no caprices,\" Hordoff said. Sch\u00fcttler v. Agassi up next Sch\u00fcttler will next face the match of his life as he meets three-time Australian Open winner and American star Andre Agassi (photo) in the finals on Sunday. Sch\u00fcttler -- who has once before played Agassi in 1998 at the ATP tour in Munich and lost a tame 1:6, 4:6 to him -- remains undaunted. \"I still have a dream. Sorry, Andre, but you've won here so many times,\" Sch\u00fcttler said in front of a 1,500-strong crowd in the packed Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne as he was interviewed by tennis legend John McEnroe for Australian television. \"He's (Agassi) one of the greatest tennis players ever. Maybe he'll eat something wrong before the match!,\" Sch\u00fcttler joked when asked how he felt about playing Agassi. Even if he loses to Agassi on Sunday, Sch\u00fcttler has already picked up a cool $ 593,925 for entering the finals. And German tennis still stands to profit if Sch\u00fcttler fails to deliver in the finals -- Agassi plans to play mixed doubles with wife and German tennis phenomenon, Steffi Graf in the French Open if he wins. Sch\u00fcttler's coach Dirk Hordorff offered better odds for his chances on Sunday. \"Agassi doesn't come from a different world. Rainer simply has to play his game.\"",

"story": "Love-Struck German Judge Turns Blind Eye to Justice Wearing black robes and being addressed as \"Your Honor\" apparently doesn't keep people from doing really, really stupid things, as one love-struck German judge recently proved. No one can blame Wolfgang W. for falling in love. The 63-year-old Munich judge (whose full last name has been withheld for legal reasons) might have been married, but he wouldn't be the first man to leave his wife for a younger woman. What does matter a little in this particular case is that W. met Fatime L. in his courtroom. The 30-year-old Albanian woman was attending the robbery trial of her lover. All that might have kept most people from going further than a friendly smile. The judge, however, pulled out his mobile phone and reportedly began sending the woman explicit text messages such as \"I'm kissing you awake\" and \"Alone with you in bed. I want to drag you into bed before breakfast and sleep with you.\" He might have gotten away with it all. But then W. withdrew an offer to sentence Fatime's boyfriend to no more than 22 months in prison and asked her to help him decide on the man's jail time. \"He should be sent away for longer so that you're at peace or he should be sent to his wife, which might also help,\" the judge wrote. \"It's up to you.\" That did it for Fatime, who forwarded the messages to her boyfriend's defense lawyer. It shouldn't come as a surprise that court officials accepted her application to remove the judge from the case. W. will have lots of time for text messaging in the future: He faces disciplinary action and charges of abuse of office, which could send him to prison for up to five years.",

"story": "Online Advertising Gathers Momentum At the German Multi-Media Congress, experts agreed that online advertising is finally witnessing an upswing after a long downturn. After experiencing a three-year slump in online advertising, the situation in today's Internet market is looking promising, according to a group of industry experts meeting in Stuttgart this week. Earlier this year, Christian Muche from online marketing at the German Multi-Media Association (DMV) predicted that Internet advertising could expect a growth rate of 20 percent in 2004. His forecast reflected a wider optimistic trend based on the recent upswing in advertising spending. Online ads outstrip other media \"According to estimates by US company Jupiter Research, turnover from online advertising will have overtaken turnover from print media by 2008,\" wrote German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung recently. Pressetext.Austria noted a similar development. \"In the first half of 2004, online advertising spending was twice as high as it was in cinema theaters,\" it wrote, while the Interactive Advertising Bureau in New York, the industry's leading association, pointed out that Internet advertising would be outstripping radio advertising by 2007. In the US, the world's largest advertising market, Web sites provided turnover of almost \u20ac7.3 billion, thereby matching the amount spent in 2000, the most lucrative year ever. Advertising also increased by 6.5 percent in Germany in the first half of 2004, with a turnover of \u20ac8.8 billion for all media. The Internet, meanwhile, registered a drop of 2.6 percent. Nonetheless, Bernd Henning from DMV market research told DW-WORLD that other studies showed the market was improving. After years of ad price dumping, prices are once again rising, he said. That's because cost-per-thousand -- the average cost for achieving a thousand exposures for a commercial against a target audience -- rises in accordance with the number of users a site attracts, and the cost of advertising rises with it. The new face of online advertising Like cinema advertising, experts agree that Internet advertising has a slow-burn effect on the consumer. Current online advertising is now far more complex and less click-oriented than it was ten years ago. 'Sticky ads' and 'Interstitials', for example -- ads that display between two pages of a website -- are interruptive, like television advertising, rather than passive, like Web banner advertising. Another trend is keyword marketing. Search engines like Google and Yahoo auction off prime positions on their pages, primarily to Internet traders with a vested interest in appearing at the top of the list in response to a query for, for example, 'digital camera'. These hits are known as \"sponsored listings\". Even though the growth in the online advertising market is considerable, its budgets are still far smaller than in other media. According to the 2003 Focus Mediaguide, the online share of the total US advertising budget was just three percent. Even in Norway, Denmark and Estonia, the European countries spending most on online advertising, the budget is negligible. Mediterranean countries spend even less. \"The North-South divide correlates with national statistics on Internet use,\" says Bernd Henning. \"The worse the weather, the more time people spend on the Internet.\"",

"story": "Will China's regulator reshuffle turn all state media into propaganda? Beijing has announced a plan to consolidate film, news and publishing under one regulatory body. With control over all media content, China's Communist Party can project its ideal image and quash dissent. China introduced a round of media regulation restructuring on Wednesday, aiming to improve the country's image domestically and abroad by centralizing film, news and publishing regulations under the Communist Party's publicity department. Announced through the state-run Xinhua News agency, the move is part of Beijing's plan to impose stricter surveillance on media content that undermines the Communist Party's message. The announcement stated that the consolidation will ensure that all broadcast media \"acts as the party's mouth piece.\" This includes everything from films, television and video games to books and radio. Based on the plan, the publicity department would have total control over media content while setting the tone for Beijing's messages domestically and abroad. Several state media outlets, including CCTV, China Global Television Network, China Radio International and China National Radio, would be merged into one broadcaster called \"Voice of China,\" which would broadcast content tailored for foreign audiences. Spreading 'socialist values' By consolidating control of all media content, China's President Xi Jinping is attempting to recentralize Beijing's dominance over all aspects of politics and society in China. Merging multiple state media outlets creates a streamlined institution that can dominantly project the Communist Party's ideal image. According to David Bandurski, co-director of the China Media Project and a fellow of the Robert Bosch Academy in Berlin, the restructuring would increase the Party's message control while also seeking ways to expand the dissemination of the Party's agenda and ideal image. \"The Party's idea is a highly centralized media network, with pooled resources, that can be innovative in its production and distribution of messaging,\" Bandurski told DW. Read more: Sieren\u2019s China: Old-school show of power China accuses Australian media of racism and paranoia To remain connected with social trends, the Communist Party in recent years has also been focusing on spreading \"socialist values\" through different cultural assets such as film, music and video games. However, Bandurski predicts that Beijing's new approach of expanding its soft power through a single centralized media outlet would struggle to be responsive and to understand its audience. \"It has always been a deep challenge for Chinese state media to push their products abroad,\" said Bandurski. \"These latest moves only compound this aspect of the problem.\" In comparison with major international news outlets, the international arm of China's state-run CCTV faces challenges in growing its audience and being seen as a propaganda mouthpiece of the Chinese government. In recent years, China has invested heavily in expanding CCTV's international reach, opening two foreign production centers, CCTV Africa and CCTV America. According to a 2014 report by the Reuters institute for the study of Journalism, CCTV is available in 140 foreign countries with seven international channels broadcasting in English, French, Spanish, Arabic, Russian and Chinese. The report also said that in contrast to Western broadcasters closing foreign offices, CCTV is expanding. Its headquarters in Beijing cost more that $ 1 billion (\u20ac 0.8 billion). Read more: Germany 'stagnating' in cultural struggle with Russia, China Opinion: China's Xi Jinping \u2014 the man who decides the fate of billions Challenges to legitimacy Bandurski said that Beijing would have to deal with growing international awareness of its aggressive posture in exploiting the open media environment in the West. The Reuters report said that CCTV didn't face a resource problem but lacked \"personnel skilled in Western content production and values.\" CCTV also faces a public perception problem. \"The low popularity of CCTV and its limited relationship networks mean that Chinese correspondents are not fully accepted as trustworthy and their reports are often doubted or rejected,\" the report said. Instead of blocking China entirely out of the global media landscape, Bandurski suggested that other countries should remain cautious about the underlying agenda of China's state-owned media. \"We should ensure in our own societies that we understand and acknowledge the repression behind these state-led voices,\" he said. China's soft power push The restructuring also strengthens China's \"United Front Work Department,\" a clandestine government agency responsible for advancing China's influence and interests around the world. It is at the forefront of China's growing soft power campaign. As part of the restructuring announced Wednesday by Xinhua, the United Front will now oversee ethnic and religious issues and China's foreign affairs. The agency works by attempting to improve relationships between the Communist Party and non-Communist elites, including other political parties, former government officials, religious groups and Chinese living overseas Xi Jinping has referred to the United Front as a \"magic weapon\" for China's soft power. To counterbalance China's growing ambitions abroad, Bandurski said that other countries need to understand how China exploits the United Front strategies worldwide through more responsive research. \"China has made its intention brutally clear, so our eyes need to stay open\" said Bandurski.",

"story": "Fuel prices weigh heavily on German spending Retail sales in Germany fell for the fifth consecutive month in February - against expectations of a rise on the back of positive economic data. But year-on-year figures remain fine. February retail sales data for Germany showed a drop of 1.1 percent compared with the previous month, according to figures published by the federal statistics office, Destatis, on Friday. It's the fifth consecutive month that saw sales drop and has surprised analysts, who had expected an increase of 1.2 percent for February in a survey carried out by Dow Jones Newswires. Annalisan Piazza, an analyst for Newedge Strategy, says the drop is only a \"sign of caution\" in the current, uncertain retail environment - rather than a \"symptom\" of German domestic demand actually \"collapsing.\" Compared with figures from February 2011, Destatis says German retail sales rose by 1.7 percent. Confidence vs. concern German consumer confidence has edged higher since the beginning of 2012, supported by a strong labor market and signs that the Germany economy is picking up speed again. But rising oil prices are \"taking their toll\" and diminishing \"spending power,\" according to Stefan Schilbe, an analyst with HSBC Trinkhaus. \"Concern over higher fuel prices will continue for a while because the Easter holidays will definitely bring higher prices again,\" he added. Christian Schulz of Berenberg Bank says sluggish retail activity can also be attributed to Germans not being \"convinced that the eurozone debt crisis is over.\" Combined with higher prices at the pump, Schulz says ongoing fears about the debt crisis will weigh heavily on people's willingness to spend. According to indicators published by market research group GfK earlier this week, consumer confidence in Germany is expected to stagnate next month due to high oil prices.

"story": "Close Relationship Between China and Iran The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council agree that Iran should not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons. The West is ready to impose strict sanctions but Russia and China disagree. They want to use diplomacy. China, which holds the rotating presidency in January, is a strong supporter of the regime in Tehran. However, Chinese dissidents are showing their support of the opposition movement on the Internet. China thinks that the nuclear row with Iran can be resolved with dialogue and negotiations. It says more time and more patience is needed. Moreover, it seems less certain than the West about Tehran\u2019s nuclear intentions. Beijing believes that the nuclear programme is only being developed for civilian purposes, says German Iran expert Udo Steinbach. \u201cChina does not share the international community\u2019s dramatic interpretation of the programme,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich presumes that Iran is working on a bomb.\u201d Three UN resolutions against Iran However, to prevent Tehran from building a bomb in the future, Beijing has already supported three UN resolutions against Iran. These allow sanctions to be imposed on organisations and individuals that develop nuclear weapons. But China does not support stricter sanctions. China has massive economic interests in Iran, from which the energy-hungry country imports some 15 percent of its oil. Chinese companies have invested millions to tap into the country\u2019s oil and gas reserves. The two regimes are also linked by a similar attitude to the international community. Neither government likes it when the West interferes with what they call their domestic affairs. They are both extremely intolerant of opposition and ready to use repression to keep it under control. \u201cWe can assume that the Chinese leadership approves the Iranian government\u2019s measures against the demonstrators,\u201d says Steinbach. \u201cThe Beijing system is still prepared to beat down any resistance.\u201d The Iranian opposition website www.rahesabz.net, which translates as the Green Path, thinks that the Chinese government is actively helping the Iranian authorities to repress protests by providing weapons and vehicles. Bloggers have posted photos to illustrate these allegations, which Tehran has rejected as being Western fakes. Chinese dissidents support Iranian opposition Whilst the regimes are thought to be working together, dissidents in both countries are also connected by the Internet. The Iranian opposition movement has received many messages of support via the Twitter-based \u201cChina4Iran\u201d group for example. \u201cSince June, we\u2019ve been following really closely because we feel the Iranian people are in a similar position as the Chinese,\u201d explains one activist, who refused to be named. \u201cWhat they did is very courageous -- they showed us courage by being willing to stand up to the regime and demand what they actually want. They want to be fully represented in this country. That\u2019s what we want here exactly in China.\u201c A spokesperson from the Chinese foreign ministry said at the beginning of China\u2019s UN Security Council presidency that the government hoped Iranian society would remain unified and stable. In January, there is likely to be little talk about international negotiations on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. Tehran has more pressing things to attend -- it hopes to get Iran's opposition movement under control. Author: Christoph Ricking/Anne Thomas Editor: Thomas B\u00e4rthlein",

"story": "Could migration derail Merkel re-election express? Angela Merkel is coming under renewed fire over her refugee policies as Germany's election battleground heats up. Left-wing rival Martin Schulz has added his voice to long-standing criticism from the right. For months, Social Democratic (SPD) candidate Martin Schulz has been trying - and failing - to find an issue to eat away at conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel's popularity. In conversation with the Sunday edition of Germany's Bild newspaper, Schulz took aim at what is perhaps Merkel's Achilles heel: her policy toward migrants from Muslim countries. \"In 2015 more than 1 million refugees came to Germany, mostly without government monitoring,\" Schulz told Bild. \"The chancellor opened our border with Austria for humanitarian reasons but unfortunately without consulting our partners in Europe. If we don't act now, that situation could repeat itself.\" Merkel has promised German voters that there will be no repeat of what happened two years ago when hundreds of thousands of people, many fleeing war-torn Syria, arrived in Germany. Numbers of migrants lessened last year but could well be set to rise again as people try to escape political uncertainty and economic hardship of places like Nigeria and Eritrea via North African countries like Libya. Well over 70,000 migrants made the extremely risky Mediterranean crossing to Italy in the first half of this year, representing an increase over 2016 of more than 25 percent. Italy has asked other EU states for help in dealing with the new arrivals, but it has so far been rebuffed. Schulz, who is set to travel to Italy on Thursday, says the EU commission should pay other member states to take in migrants and accuses Merkel of calculated inaction before Germany's September election. \"Those who play for time and try to ignore the issue until the national election are just being cynical,\" Schulz said. At the height of the refugee crisis in 2015 and early 2016, Merkel and her conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) fell to historic lows in public opinion polls, with more than 80 percent of those asked saying they believed her government didn't have control over the situation. Merkel and her party have since recovered and currently lead Schulz and the SPD by around 15 percentage points in opinion surveys. Merkel, who's currently on vacation and had no public appearances scheduled for Sunday, didn't immediately respond to Schulz's criticism. And perhaps her main problem on the migrant issue is not from the Social Democrats at all. Attacks from other conservatives Although Schulz may have been trying to capitalize on the issue, Merkel, arguably, has no big reason to fear attacks from the left. As the junior coalition partners in her current government, the SPD supported her welcoming policy toward refugees. The greater threat could come from the right, where Merkel is considerably more liberal than the vast majority of conservatives in Germany and the rest of Europe. The larger the number of migrants grows, the greater the pressure to restrict the flow of people from the Middle East and Northern Africa to Europe. During the week, for instance, Austria's conservative foreign minister, Sebastian Kurz, threatened to close down the Brenner Pass between his country and Italy if the number of illegal migrants to Austria rose. And Merkel has also come under fire on the issue from the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). On Sunday, the CSU publicly celebrated its platform for the election, entitled the \"Bavaria Plan.\" It calls for the annual number of refugees to Germany to be capped at 200,000 - an idea Merkel has rejected. CSU chairman Horst Seehofer couldn't resist calling out the chancellor on the issue. In an interview with Welt newspaper, Seehofer said \"everybody knows\" that the \"waves of migration will continue.\" Seehofer predicted that Merkel's decision to open Germany's borders would cost the CDU-CSU an absolute majority in September's election and claimed that conservatives throughout Germany were coming round to the CSU's position. \"Because the orientation on refugee policy has changed in our direction, it is again possible to work with the CDU credibly,\" Seehofer said. Seehofer added that the conservatives' resurgence in opinion polls was down in part to a harder line taken on migrants. And he invoked the specter of the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD). \"What I think is most important now is to use clever policies to push the AfD below the 5-percent hurdle (needed for parliamentary representation in Germany),\" Seehofer said. \"That can only happen if we continue to be smart in our policies on security, Turkey, refugees and Europe.\" Parallel trends between migrants and populism The connection between refugee policy and the AfD cannot be dismissed. Germany's right-wing populists made a quantum leap in the polls, taking over 20 percent of the vote in some regional German elections in 2016, as the effects of the mass arrivals in the preceding years became apparent. But when the Balkan migration route was largely closed, the number of refugees dropped, and the AfD's fortunes took a corresponding downturn. The party currently attracts between 7 and 9 percent in the opinion-polls. The downswing is due to party in-fighting, but also to the general sense among the populace that the refugee \"crisis\" is easing. The loss of support for the AfD roughly coincides with the conservatives' revival in opinions polls. But that trend itself could very well reverse if the increasing number of migrants coming to Italy results in a spike in new arrivals to Germany before the election. A study published by the Bertelsmann Foundation last November found that fear of globalization was the main driver of support for right-wing populism in Europe, and that the issue of refugees played the largest role in constituting that fear. Political scientists say that migrants and refugees are the single biggest issue inspiring people to vote for the AfD, and that AfD supporters tend to be single-issue voters. An analysis done by the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung newspaper after one of the AfD's biggest triumphs in September 2016 showed that 82 percent of the party's voters said that immigration was a major issue. And 17 percent of voters in general said the AfD was best equipped of all the parts to deal with refugees - on other issues, the party struggled to escape the low single digits on the competence question. All of this suggests that the upturn in the number of migrants to Germany this summer would benefit the AfD at the polls and possibly have an effect on Angela Merkel's attempt to win a fourth term as chancellor.",

"story": "German Criminal Police Chief Warns of Possible Terrorist Attacks Islamic militants trained in Pakistan and Afghanistan are planning attacks in Germany, although there is no evidence of any imminent threat, the country's top police officer was quoted as saying on Sunday. Joerg Ziercke, head of the Federal Criminal Police (BKA), told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper that more than 50 militants had traveled from Germany to training camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan run by the Taliban, al Qaeda and the Islamic Jihad Union (IJU). When asked by the German daily if it was safe for the nation to breathe easy again, Ziercke said that he was unable to sound the all clear, as Germany has repeatedly eluded catastrophe by a mere hair's breadth. \"Considering the statements from al Qaeda and the IJU, we are convinced it has been decided to mount attacks in Germany,\" he said. \"However, there is currently no concrete evidence of imminent strikes.\" 900 Hezbollah supporters The interview with Ziercke came on the heels of a secret report release by the BKA saying that the Lebanese-based Hezbollah movement has the capacity to undertake damaging attacks in Germany. The German weekly Focus reported that the militia had the logistics to carry out wide-scale attacks on physical and human targets. The BKA is reported to number Hezbollah supporters in Germany at around 900. Focus pointed to the case of a 29-year-old medical student at Germany's Goettingen University, who was detained in Israel last month. It reported the man was suspected of making contact with Hezbollah supporters in Germany and of having received $20,000 (13,300 euros) for espionage work. Germany untouched so far In contrast to European neighbors such as Spain or Britain, Germany has not suffered a major recent attack on its own soil. But Ziercke said German investigators had foiled seven plots, including attacks planned by three men arrested in the western Sauerland region last year who authorities believe were targeting US installations in Germany. Altogether, there are currently 200 investigations linked to Islamic terrorism being conducted by the BKA, Ziercke told Tagesspiegel, saying that the danger has therefore in no way diminished. \"A single-digit number of militants had returned to Germany from the training camps and were among around 100 suspects considered a threat,\" he said.",

"story": "Amid injury woes, Bayern look to exorcise Gladbach defeat The Bundesliga's 16th matchday kicks off with Mainz hosting Stuttgart. The weekend's schedule also features a couple of derbies as Bayern look to bounce back from their first defeat of the season- without Frank Ribery. Despite being bitten hard by the injury bug Bayern should still like their chances when they host Ingolstadt in the first Bundesliga derby between the two Bavarian clubs. Bayern cruised to victory to finish top of their group in the Champions League in midweek, but are coming off a damper in M\u00f6nchengladback last weekend, where they suffered a 3-1 defeat to Andre Schubert's men - their first in the Bundesliga since he took over. Ahead of Saturday's contest, Bayern stressed that they would not be taking their opponents lightly. \"They deserve to be where they are in the league (11th) and I hope they stay up (in the Bundesliga),\" Bayern captain Philipp Lahm said. \"They don't just play defensively and don't just stand at the back.\" Ribery and Benatia add to injury woes Coach Pep Guardiola will have to rearrange his starting lineup yet again on Saturday, after the news that Frank Ribery (pictured above), picked up a muscle strain in Zagreb and will be out for the rest of the year. Center back Medhi Benatia is also out after picking up a thigh strain in the Croatian capital. The news is particularly bitter for Ribery, who just a week ago had returned to action after an absence of nine months due to an ankle injury. At his press conference on Friday, Guardiola also confirmed that Arjen Robben remained injured. Also out are David Alaba, Mario G\u00f6tze, Douglas Costa, and Juan Bernat. Champions League frustrations Two teams that didn't fare so well in the Champions League this past week, face each other in what promises to be the most interesting game of matchday 16, as third-placed M\u00f6nchengladbach travel to eighth-placed Leverkusen in a Rhineland derby. Gladbach are coming off a 4-2 defeat at Manchester City, which saw them not only crash out of the Champions League, but also miss the Europa League cut. Leverkusen, meanwhile, were unable to get the winning goal against a weakened Barcelona side, which they needed to reach the round of 16 in the world's top club competition. Gladbach's coach Schubert is looking to extend his run of eight wins and two draws in the Bundesliga since he took over from Lucien Favre six games into the campaign, and he appears unconcerned about how the defeat in the north of England might affect his players going into Leverkusen. \"The boys are physically very stable and know how to evaluate the game,\" he said, adding that the match would be\"between two teams who are eye to eye.\" His charges also have the slight advantage of having had one more day of rest than Leverkusen. Schmidt feeling the heat Schubert's opposite number, Roger Schmidt, is starting to feel the heat, having lost six games in the Bundesliga this season, almost equaling the total number of defeats Leverkusen suffered last season (seven), when they finished fourth. He was also was extremely frustrated by the \"Werkself's\" failure to put away a plethora of chances against Barca on Wednesday, describing it as a \"tragedy\" that they failed to advance. On the other hand, he praised the fact that they did create the chances in the first place and said he hoped his charges could use the \"momentum\" from that performance to their advantage.

"story": "Europol launches pan-European counterterrorism center The EU law enforcement agency has announced the formation of a strategic center to combat terrorism in Europe. The hub is tasked with boosting intelligence-sharing among member states and tracking terrorists' finances. EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos announced on Monday the creation of the European Counter Terrorism Centre (ECTC), which aims to boost cooperation among Europol member states in their fight against terrorist threats in Europe. \"The establishment of the European Counter Terrorism Centre is a major strategic opportunity for the EU to make our collective efforts to fight terrorism more effective,\" said Avramopoulos, with Dutch Justice Minister Ard van der Steur and Europol Director Rob Wainwright at a press conference announcing the center's creation. Europol said that the ECTC, based in The Hague, would focus on \"tackling foreign fighters, sharing intelligence and expertise on terrorism financing, online terrorist propaganda and extremism, illegal arms trafficking and international cooperation to increase effectiveness and prevention.\" The initiative follows the Paris attacks claimed by the so-called \"Islamic State\" militant group in November, which killed at least 130 people and wounded hundreds more. The assault on the French capital prompted fears of similar attacks across the continent. Europol chief Wainwright said that some 5,000 European nationals had left to fight alongside militant groups in Syria and Iraq, warning that they posed significant threats upon returning to their countries. \"Our ambition is for the ECTC to become a central information hub in the fight against terrorism in the EU, providing analysis for ongoing investigations and contributing to a coordinated reaction in the event of major terrorist attacks,\" said Wainwright. Increased intelligence sharing among EU member states - notably France and Belgium - in the wake of November's attacks led to the agency receiving 2.7 terabytes of information, \"resulting in 800 intelligence leads and more than 1,600 leads on suspicious financial transactions,\" Europol said. The law enforcement agency added that the ECTC's organizational structure would mirror Europol's, allowing for cooperation between counterterrorism authorities in the EU.",

"story": "Charles Manson dies aged 83 after decades in prison Notorious cult leader Charles Manson passed away on Sunday evening in a hospital in Kern County, California. Manson directed a series of gruesome murders, including that of Hollywood star Sharon Tate. After half a century in prison, the hippie cult leader died on Sunday evening, local time. He became a face of evil across America after organizing the horrific murders of pregnant Hollywood actress, Sharon Tate, and six others during the summer of 1969. Debra Tate, Sharon Tate's sister, told celebrity website TMZ that she had received a call from prison officials telling her that Manson had died on Sunday evening, following a long illness. California prison officials later released a statement confirming Manson's death. Shocking brutality The murders horrified the world and, together with the violence that marked a 1969 Rolling Stones concert at California's Altamont Speedway, showed the violent, drug-fueled underbelly of the hippie counterculture movement, and seemed to mark the end of the era of peace and love. Read more: - Manson follower Leslie Van Houten denied parole for 20th time - Charles Manson receives license to tie the knot behind bars \"Many people I know in Los Angeles believe that the Sixties ended abruptly on August 9, 1969,\" author Joan Didion wrote in her 1979 book \"The White Album.\" A life of criminality Manson had been in and out of jail for petty crimes since childhood. He moved to San Francisco during the so-called \"Summer of Love,\" busking on the streets with his guitar. But he quickly established himself in a hippie commune, surrounded by mostly female followers he referred to as his \"Family.\" The commune later moved its base to a ranch in California's Death Valley. Manson had at least one child with one of his followers. Manson became fixated on the Beatles, and created a bizarre philosophy inspired by a twisted interpretation of the band\u2019s song lyrics. In particular, he was obsessed with the song \"Helter Skelter\", the title of which was scrawled on the walls in his victim\u2019s blood, and which he believed could lead to triggering a race war. Maintained his innocence Despite the evidence against him, Manson claimed throughout his trial in 1970 that he was innocent and that society itself was guilty. \"These children that come at you with knives, they are your children. You taught them; I didn't teach them. I just tried to help them stand up,\" he said in the courtroom. After the almost year-long trial, Manson and three of his cult members \u2014 Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten \u2014were found guilty of murder and given the death sentence. Another defendant, Charles \"Tex\" Watson, was later convicted. After the California Supreme Court struck down the death penalty in 1972, they all had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment. Atkins died in prison in 2009. Krenwinkel, Van Houten and Watson are still behind bars. During his jail term Manson applied for parole 12 times, most recently in 2012. On the last occasion, he apparently told the court he was \"a very dangerous man.\" He was not eligible to apply again until 2027. In a 1981 interview in jail, Manson claimed that he felt at home behind bars after spending most of his life there. cl/rt (AFP, AP)",

"story": "From stem cells to physics fraudulent science results are plenty but hard to find A Japanese stem cell scientist who fabricated research has agreed to retract two of her papers. But many other mistakes, sloppy or even fraudulent results in science may never be exposed. Haruko Obokata at the Riken Center for Developmental Biology in Kobe, Japan, claimed to have discovered an easy and straightforward way to reprogramme adult cells to become stem cells. Soon after publication in \"Nature\" in January, problems and accusations arose with fellow scientists saying they could not replicate the results. Obokata was accused of having plagiarized passages of text and of having used duplicated images. The Riken Research Center urged her to retract the papers. Obokata refused - until this week. No surprise \"Couldn't we see that this news would follow when we first read the news of the discovery?\" a reader writes in a forum at German news magazine \"Spiegel Online.\" Indeed: the results were too good to be true. Especially where stem cells are concerned, sudden miracles tend to fall flat when they are checked rigorously by peers. The story of South Korean veterinarian Hwang Woo-suk is similar. In 2006 he claimed to have created human embryonic stem cells by cloning, but was later dismissed from Seoul National University when it was revealed that he had faked his results. And in the field of physics, a German researcher called Jan Hendrik Sch\u00f6n became prominent with his groundbreaking experiments on semiconductors, until 2002 when it turned out his results were a fraud. The case produced one true result: the emergence of a new saying. German scientists can now often be heard talking about \"Ergebnisse sch\u00f6nen\" - which basically means \"to buff your results.\" It's a nod to the fraudster's surname \"Sch\u00f6n,\" which means beautiful, nice, pretty or good, and perhaps also an acknowledgement of the fact that buffing results happens quite a lot. The exception proves the rule But be careful if you are tempted to \"sch\u00f6n\" your results. The German research funding organization \"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft\" (DFG) has a central committee for whistleblowers. It's a place where researchers can report colleagues whom they suspect of misconduct or fraud. \"Faking results is not a mass phenomenon,\" says Marco Finetti, a DFG spokesperson. In 15 years the committee has dealt with 500 suspected cases. Most cases involve sloppy or wrong citation, or plagiarism. Finetty says, \"hard data manipulation is an exception.\" It does happen, though. Haymo Ross, an editor with the journals \"Angewandte Chemie\" and \"European Journal of Organic Chemistry,\" says he often finds faults in the experimental sections of papers submitted for publication. \"As recently as last week I received two manipulated spectra,\" Ross says. \"That happens quite often. Authors delete unwanted signals out of them.\" But given that he receives about 10,000 manuscripts every year, Ross says this is indeed an exception. You just have to be clever enough If, when challenged, an author cannot explain why his results seem strange or manipulated, the journal may reject the paper. And if the fraud is very serious, \"we might ban the author from publishing with us for a certain time,\" says Ross. At least two reviewers check each paper before publication. There is also software that can check pictures and graphics for any peculiarities or anomalies. \"But those who really want to deceive will find a way to do it,\" he says. Sometimes frauds only become apparent when other researchers try to reproduce the results, the DFG's Finetti says. Facing the paper stress So why do researchers fake results? The reasons are plenty. Eva Wille, vice president and executive director of Global Chemistry with the publisher Wiley-VCH, says one reason is the growing pressures that scientists face within the academic community. \"Funders and politicians can build up a lot of pressure because they want to see a quick return of investment on their money.\" Especially in Asia, the pressure can be enormous, she says. \"To complete a PhD, scientists need at least three publications in respected journals\" - showing good results. Some researchers - particularly the more ambitious one - will find it hard to cope, or easier to cheat. Wille says the situation in Germany is a bit better. But the country is far from pure. A 35-year-old German biochemist, who wants to remain anonymous, has told DW that he has experienced a lot of pressure while doing his PhD. The fact that he doesn't want to be named is a reflection of how sensitive the issue of fraudulent science is. \"Scientists are evaluated entirely based on the number of the papers they publish and in which journals they appeared,\" he says. \"That put my boss and my whole research group under a great strain.\" Publication means money A long list of publications in well-known journals can help secure research funds. And without a long, credible list, a scientist's whole career may even fail to get off the ground. So some scientists will be tempted to spice up their results. The biochemist we spoke to says this has never happened in his group. \"We have avoided the pressure,\" he says, by choosing projects that have resulted in a lot of papers in a comparably short amount of time, and by avoiding \"riskier\" projects. But there is one thing that no professor has time for these days, the biochemist says, and that is time to teach their students. Perhaps also about ethics. \"It is a nuisance for many professors,\" he says. \"Because they need their precious time to push their own research further.\" Wiley-VCH's Eva Wille agrees. Professors are always on the run, she says, flying from one conference to the next. \"They don't train their people any more,\" says Wille. And they don't have the time to check the results of their researchers in detail. \"And that's when things happen like at the Riken Institute [with Haruko Obokata's research].\" It is important, she adds, to teach students about ethics in science even as early as during their first semester. Sometimes, however, it may just come down to a personal craving for recognition that generates these amazing but wrong results. And no amount of ethics is going to change that.",

"story": "German investigators search for cause of deadly train crash German officials are continuing their investigation into the cause of the train collision over the weekend that killed at least 10 and left others seriously injured. Two victims were identified Monday as police continued their investigation into the cause of a train crash that killed at least 10 people in the eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt over the weekend. The crash took place near the city of Magdeburg late Saturday when a goods trains collided head-on with a local passenger train. It is not yet clear what caused the accident, which also injured 23 people, many of them seriously. On Monday, a police spokesman said there were no new facts in the case. On Sunday, the head of the regional government, Wolfgang B\u00f6hmer, said human error was the likely cause. Unanswered questions Speaking to journalists, B\u00f6hmer said one of the trains had probably ignored a red stoplight on the section of single track where the accident occurred. \"It's likely the stop signal wasn't respected. It's not normal that two trains were running on the same track,\" B\u00f6hmer said. However, Saxony-Anhalt Interior Minister Holger Hovelmann has warned against jumping to conclusions, and federal police official Ralf Kr\u00fcger told a press conference that accident investigators had yet to reach a conclusion. \"The inquiry has been opened. The conclusion will be made public as soon as possible,\" Kr\u00fcger said. \"The signal system must obviously be checked out.\" Another police spokesman had earlier said authorities were \"investigating in all directions - including human error as well as technical failure.\" He said the trains had hit each other with such force that passengers in the front carriages would have died on impact, which was reportedly heard miles away. Heavy rescue deployment The train, the HarzElbeExpress, carrying around 50 passengers, was traveling on a single track section from Magdeburg to the town of Halberstadt. Several carriages were derailed after the collision. More than 150 firemen, police and rescue workers were deployed at the scene. Traffic was interrupted on the line and bus shuttles were set up. Heavy fog prevented helicopters from airlifting the worst injured. Police weren't ruling out a rise in the death toll because of the severity of the injuries.

"story": "Rights groups consider responses to Lithuanian anti-gay law After Lithuanian lawmakers approved a bill to keep material deemed harmful away from children - including information about homosexuality - some EU parliamentarians and rights groups are considering what to do next. European members of parliament, including that body's gay and lesbian working group, as well as human rights groups are weighing their options regarding a response to a bill passed by Lithuania's parliament that would ban the dissemination of information to young people seen as promoting homosexuality. \"This is crazy and un-European and totally out of thinking for me and many others,\" said Ulrike Lunacek, a new EU parliamentarian and member of the European Parliament's Intergroup on Gay and Lesbian rights. As Europe has long been held up as a global beacon on progressive legislation regarding gay rights - same-sex marriage or some version thereof is legal in many EU countries - the bill passed in Vilnius seems like an unexpected slap in the face. It brings back memories of cultural battles that many in western Europe at least thought were largely behind them. \"But we have to be aware there are still forces out there who want to deny equal rights to gays and lesbians,\" she said. \"We still have to convince people that equal rights for gays and lesbians doesn't mean taking away the rights of heterosexuals.\" Now she and others are considering the next steps, which include encouraging the new president of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek, to express his concern to the Baltic nation that the new law could be prejudicial to understanding and tolerance of homosexuals. \"The new law contradicts the values of the European Union where minority rights are and should remain respected. It is the duty of the President of the European Parliament to ensure that all minorities are treated equally,\" said Michael Cashman, President of the Intergroup, in a statement. Child-protection or anti-gay censorship? It appears that a majority of lawmakers in this largely Roman Catholic country of 3.3 million do see homosexuality as a threat, since the bill that 86 of the Baltic state's 141 parliamentarians voted for says \"public dissemination\" of information favorable to homosexuality can harm the mental health and physical, intellectual and moral development of young people. Lithuania's outgoing president, Valdas Adamkus, had refused to sign the bill into law when 76 lawmakers approved it on June 16, but on Tuesday, a large majority overturned his veto. \"Parliament has demonstrated its will to institutionalize homophobia,\" Vladimir Simonko, head of the Lithuanian Gay League, told the AFP news agency. The measure lists 19 examples of \"detrimental\" information that should be kept from minors, including instructions on making explosives, images of death and severe injury, hypnosis, and information that promotes bad eating. But the section on a ban on information that \"agitates for homosexual, bisexual and polygamous relations\" has caused the most controversy and, according to gay campaigners, will do the most harm. \"This is a huge danger for young people who are lesbian/gay/bisexual not only to receive proper objective information about sexuality and development, but to receive support if needed, because basically all channels will be closed to them,\" said Juris Lavrikovs of the International Lesbian and Gay Association of Europe. Right-wing backlash The bill was backed by the right-wing populist Order and Justice Party. Petras Grazulis, the bill's co-sponsor, and other party members did not return phone calls or e-mails seeking comment. He told the Associated Press that the bill's passage was a step toward helping Lithuania \"raise healthy generations unaffected by the rotten culture overwhelming them.\" Henricus Mickevicius, director of the Human Rights Monitoring Institute in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, said fears and insecurity over changing societal norms have played a role in the passage of this legislation. Since the country joined the EU in 2004, Lithuania has been asked to accept a host of new rules on gender and sexual equality that have unnerved more conservative members of society. \"It's created a situation where people become concerned, and even scared, that it's undermined our national traditions, values and so on,\" Mickevicius said. According to him, the law intrudes on freedom of speech and violates international human rights standards. It is written so broadly, he and others have said, enforcing it will be difficult. Deciding on violations, and handing out fines for what will be classified as misdemeanors, could largely depend on the social views of those charged with enforcement. According to rights groups and campaigners, Lithuania's move violates the spirit of EU principles on equality, particularly Artricle 6, paragraph 1 of the EU Treaty, according to which \"The Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human right snd fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law, principles which are common to the Member States.\" Options According to MEP Lunacek, the head of the Green parliamentary group in the European Parliament, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, called on Jerzy Buzek on Wednesday morning to write a note of protest to Lithuania. She said that might carry some weight with Vilnius, since Burzek is from Poland, another former Soviet-satellite state which joined the European bloc not long ago. \"Having a president of the EU parliament like Mr. Burzek, who himself comes from a new-member country, would help say to the Lithuanian parliament - look, this is not European,\" she said. But the EU's options overall are limited. Child-protection does not fall under Brussels' jurisdiction, and while the EU could apply sanctions of some sort, such options are not being considered right now. Another possibility would be to cancel some Lithuanian voting rights on the European Council, according to Lunacek. The new Lithuanian president, Dalia Grybauskaite, has not yet signed the law, although she is required to do so within three days. By Lithuanian law she cannot reimpose a veto. There has been as of yet no signal whether her office is considering further action against it. Human rights monitor Mickevicius said if that happens, Lithuanian activists will have to just wait. \"It may sound cynical, but we'll have to see who becomes the first victim of this law and then take it through the national courts or even the European Court of Human Rights,\" he said.

"story": "Muslim Brotherhood detainees die in Egypt prison convoy Police have cracked down on inmates en route to an Egyptian prison, according to officials. Dozens of detainees were reported dead. Authorities said police were trying to stop an escape by Muslim Brotherhood followers. An alleged prison break sparked a violent reaction from security forces, according to Egyptian media on Sunday evening. Police used force when inmates in a transfer convoy north of Cairo began rioting and attempting to escape, officials said. The official MENA news agency has reported that gunmen attempted to free prisoners during the transfer. Thirty-six Muslim Brotherhood members died in the clash, according to MENA, a figure later confirmed by police. The Interior Ministry said they had died through suffocation from tear gas as police tried to free an officer being held hostage in a van. However, one legal source told the news agency Reuters that the men had died of asphyxiationin cramped conditions during the journey. The news of violence against members of the Islamist group follows several days of police crackdowns on protesters in cities across Egypt. Supporters of ousted and detained President Mohammed Morsi have been demonstrating against the forced removal of protesters from sit-ins on Wednesday, which left more than 600 people dead. Since the crackdown began on Wednesday, some 800 people have died in clashes across Egypt. Police have arrested roughly 1,000 people in connection with this week's protests, according to state media. Of those, about 250 face charges of murder, attempted murder and terrorism. Pro-Brotherhood protesters calling for the release of Morsi took to the streets of Cairo, but were prevented from gathering outside the country's Constitutional Court as they had planned. Other marches took place across the country, including the central Fayyoum province and the Minya province in the south. The protests ended as a dusk-to-dawn curfew declared by the army went into force. At a gathering of military leaders on Sunday, Interim Defense Minister General Abdel-Fatah el-Sissi called for the inclusion of the former president's Islamist supporters in Egypt's political future. El-Sissi had led the July 3 coup that removed Mohammed Morsi from power. \"There is room for everyone in Egypt,\" el-Sissi said, according to the army's official Facebook page. However, the general also cautioned that \"we will not stand by silently watching the destruction of the country and the people or the torching of the nation and terrorizing of the citizens.\" kms,rc/ch (AP, AFP, Reuters)",

"story": "Lack of opportunity leads to mass exodus from Kosovo In recent months, tens of thousands have fled Kosovo, the youngest European state. Poverty and a lack of prospects at home are just two reasons why they're leaving. \"Why should I stay here?\" asks Fitim S., who has three children, ages 10, 8 and 3. Until a few months ago, he received 80 euros a month in benefits. But even that has been cut now, as he owns a house and others do not. \"We've been told that we can claim asylum in Germany,\" Fitim says, adding that he would like to stay in Kosovo if he could find work paying \"around 200 euros ($230) a month.\" But, things being as they are, all five of them are packed up and ready to get on the bus to Germany. For over two months, up to 10 buses have left for the north every evening from the capital, Pristina. It's a similar picture in most other towns. They usually have no problems passing through Serbia despite Belgrade's reluctance to recognize a Kosovo passport. They go as far as Subotica, a small town near the Serbia-Hungary border. It's a Schengen border, which most Kosovars then cross on foot with the help of corrupt police officers and traffickers who charge 200 euros per head. If they get caught by Hungarian police, they claim asylum in Hungary. But they'd rather make it all the way to Germany, Austria or Scandinavia. 'They leave' Kosovo has not seen this many people leave the country since the war in 1999. There are no official numbers, but government sources say up to 30,000 have fled Kosovo in the past two months. Some diplomats in Pristina, however, think 50,000 is a more realistic figure - some media outlets claim it's even more. Many schools have seen the effects: Teachers have been let go as more than 5,200 students have left. The streets and restaurants in Pristina, normally full of life, are also emptier than usual. For a country with just 1.8 million people, this mass exodus poses a problem. \"Kosovars don't believe in political parties, parliament or the government anymore,\" sociologist Artan Muhaxhiri told DW. \"So, first chance they get, they leave.\" Kosovo is one of the poorest countries in Europe, with unemployment at 45 percent and more than 34 percent of people living in poverty, meaning on less than 1.42 euros a day. About 18 percent even live on just 94 cents a day. But there are also some middle class Kosovars giving up fairly well-paid jobs to leave the country illegally. Reality check In January, Kosovars made up the second biggest group of applicants for asylum in Germany, after Syrians, according to German authorities. Serbians and Albanians were in third and fourth place, with some of those possibly Kosovars with Serbian or Albanian passports. For most Kosovars, their dreams of making it in Germany end as soon as they arrive. \"There is no asylum for Kosovars,\" Manfred Schmidt, president of the German Migration and Refugee Authority, told DW. While Kosovo is not yet on the list of safe countries, like Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina or Macedonia, Kosovars seeking asylum are practically always rejected, Schmidt said. Those who do not leave Germany within two weeks of their rejection may be forced to leave and asked not to enter Schengen territory for the next five years. Government media campaign On their return, many Kosovars find themselves destitute, having lost everything for a shattered dream. \"When this exodus is over there'll likely be more people in Brussels calling for a liberalization of visa policies for Kosovo,\" Dusan Reljic, head of the Brussels bureau of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. Under pressure from diplomats, the government in Pristina started a media campaign asking people not to leave Kosovo. Border controls in Serbia and Hungary have also been stepped up. All to little avail, as more buses keep heading toward Serbia, with more people on board seeking a new life in Germany, Austria or Scandinavia.",

"story": "Water Festival kicks off in Phnom Penh Phnom Penh has launched its annual Water Festival, the biggest event of the year and at least two million people have descended on the Cambodian capital to watch the boat races on the river. The taxis, trucks and minibuses have been rolling into Phnom Penh for days, bringing some two million people into the capital for Cambodia\u2019s biggest event that ends on Tuesday. Among them are the racing crews for more than 400 longboats from across Cambodia, here to compete in a festival that marks a 12th century naval victory. These are not your average canoe: Each one requires up to 70 men or women to paddle. A few carefree days in the capital The attraction of the Water Festival is easy to understand \u2013 life in Cambodia\u2019s countryside is difficult, and this holiday represents a rare chance for people to enjoy a few carefree days in the capital. My Seyhang came his team from Kratie province in the remote north-east to take part in his sixth Water Festival. He told me what it would take to win: \"It all depends on the amount of practice, and we have to make the boat go as fast as possible. We need a strong boat with a good spirit so that we will win easily. It's the same with the boxers \u2013 if they don't practice enough, they will lose.\" 5,000 sex workers expected But it\u2019s not just crowds and competitors who have come to Phnom Penh - sex workers have also made their way here. The head of one collective expected 5,000 prostitutes to turn up since they can earn 100 dollars a day during the festival, five times more than they normally make. While the authorities promised to arrest sex workers, teams from organizations such as WorldVision were distributing condoms and advice to competitors. WorldVision\u2019s Ruah Saran said that although most competitors were embarrassed to discuss the subject, \"some men are happy because our message is: 'Don\u2019t forget about HIV if you are in Phnom Penh to enjoy the Water Festival. And don\u2019t take HIV home to your wife.' And that is a message they are happy to hear.\" A practice run down the Tonle Sap River Down on the river a team from Kampong Chhnang province in central Cambodia allowed me on to their canoe for a practice run down Phnom Penh's Tonle Sap. Team boss Rong Chhun sounded confident: \"This year, I personally selected all the men on the team \u2013 they are all very, very strong. I removed the weaker men, because they have not enough strength and they look thin so we let them rest. I found very strong paddlers, so I hope we will win.\" While the 40 men line the gunwales and churn up a spray, I lay as low as possible in the canoe avoiding the oar handles that are rowing back and forth just above my head. Under human power we sped down the centre of the river, which is about 400 meters wide here. It took about three minutes to cover the course. The team gave it a final burst as we come up to the finishing line \u2013 the Royal Palace. It seemed to me that they were in with a very good chance.

"story": "Mzoudi Verdict Postponed Amid New Testimony Al Qaeda is allegedly trying to assassinate Abdelghani Mzoudi, who is on trial in Germany for his suspected involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks, a witness said on Thursday. The expected verdict has now been postponed. Mzoudi had been released from jail on Dec. 11 after an anonymous witness said he was not involved in planning the attacks. A Hamburg court had been expected to announce its verdict on Thursday but in a surprising turn of events, judges agreed to hear new testimony that allegedly incriminates the 31-year-old. The new witness for the prosecution is a former Iranian intelligence agent, according to Mzoudi\u2019s lawyers. A police officer who interrogated the man said the witness claimed to have received an e-mail in which Mzoudi is named as a member of the outside circle of the Hamburg terrorist cell around Sept. 11 hijacker Mohammed Atta. According to the police officer\u2019s testimony, the e-mail mentioned a person, who is on trial in Germany and has been released to help law enforcement authorities in their search for further members of the terrorist cell. That\u2019s why al Qaeda was allegedly planning to \u201celiminate\u201d Mzoudi, the officer said. He added that the Iranian intelligence agent had asked for money to testify against Mzoudi. \u201cHe said he had to make a living,\u201d the officer said. Allegedly the agent warned U.S. authorities of planned terrorist attacks prior to Sept. 11. The prosecution has asked the court to take a 30-day recess in order to evaluate the testimony. On Thursday, judges will also hear testimony from a federal prosecutor and another police officer who interrogated the man. Acquittal likely until now Mzoudi had been expected to leave the courtroom a free man after his Dec. 11 release from prison: An anonymous witness had cleared him of any involvement in planning the Sept. 11 attacks. Ramzi Binalshibh, the mastermind behind the attacks who is now in U.S. custody, is believed to be that witness. The defense has asked the court to acquit their client, while prosecutors are calling for a sentence of 15 years in prison for belonging to a terrorist organization and abetting murder in more than 3,000 cases. German authorities have said they plan to deport Mzoudi to his home country of Morocco in case of an acquittal. Mzoudi has been trying to stay in Germany, saying that he fears getting arrested in Morocco or facing extradition to the U.S.",

"story": "South Africa's ANC 'must end corruption' to win back voters The ruling party has published a policy paper calling for an end to internal squabbles, poor governance and corruption. The report predicts that more voters will desert the party if it fails to reform. An ANC policy document released on Sunday warned that the party, which has ruled virtually unopposed since the end of apartheid in 1994, now faced \"declining fortunes.\" The paper, produced by the party's leadership, blamed \"internal squabbles, money politics, corruption and poor performance in government\" adding that they had all conspired \"to undermine its legitimacy in the eyes of the broader public.\" The report also warned that the party must deliver on promises to tackle poverty, in a country where about 35 percent of the labor force is unemployed or has given up looking for work. The ANC suffered its worst-ever results in local polls last August, losing its grip on cities including Pretoria and Johannesburg, amid a slew of corruption allegations against President Jacob Zuma. The party's policy chief Jeff Radebe acknowledged that the party was \"increasingly losing trust of the people.\" Win back trust \"The organization must act urgently to restore its moral character to win back the trust of the people,\" he told a meeting at the ANC's Johannesburg headquarters. More than two decades after the ANC ended white-minority rule with Nelson Mandela at its helm, inequality festers in South Africa. Black people make up 80 percent of the 54 million population, yet the white minority control the lion's share of the economy in terms of ownership of land and companies. The paper contained few specific policies but is to form the basis of debates at the party's national conference which kicks off on June 30, party officials said. Zuma tries to shore up support Zuma called this month for the constitution to be changed so white-owned land could be redistributed to black South Africans without compensation for owners. He has also called for a public expenditure boost to fund a \"radical economic transformation,\" at the same time as his Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan is trying to tackle graft and uncontrolled spending. Zuma's term as ANC leader ends at the end of the year, and a new leader will be picked at the June conference. Analysts said factional fighting over who should replace Zuma, who has governed since 2009, has seen the ANC government take its eye off much-needed policy implementation. The party's constitution does not bar him from standing for a third term, but he has repeatedly said he will not. mm/jm (AFP, Reuters)",

"story": "Would-be killer of Prophet Muhammad cartoonist stands trial In Denmark, the trial of a Somali man charged with the attempted murder of a cartoonist who drew caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad has begun. Last year the suspect tried to break into the cartoonist's home with an axe. The trial of a 29-year-old Somali man accused of attempting to murder a cartoonist who drew caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad is set to begin Wednesday. The charges stem from an incident in January, 2010 where the suspect tried to enter the home of cartoonist Kurt Westergaard by taking an axe to the front door. Police were quickly on the scene and shot and wounded the Somali suspect, who also faces charges of attempted terrorism, attacking a police officer and illegal arms possession. Westergaard was one of a dozen Danish cartoonists who sparked a deep controversy in Denmark in 2005 when the Jyllands-Posten newspaper published a series of cartoons depicting the Muslim Prophet Muhammad. Controversial cartoons The Muslim world was quick to protest the publication of the cartoons, especially after they were reprinted outside Denmark. Westergaard has received a number of death threats over the drawings. The Jyllands-Posten itself has been the target of violent plots as well. At the end of December, Danish and Swedish police arrested five men accused of planning a killing spree of the newspaper's staff at their offices in Copenhagen. Westergaard has maintained that his drawing did not necessarily depict the Prophet Muhammad, and that he intended to show a terrorist who evokes Islam and abuses it.

"story": "Opinion: Bush's Second-Term Task Politics is about power and persuasion. Getting the mix right is part of any president's challenge, particularly if a second term is involved, comments Jackson Janes on President Bush's State of the Union address. President Bush is beginning his second term with a lot of power. He won more votes than any other president. His party has control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives with larger majorities than during his first term. Yet his ability to persuade is more limited. He has a very low approval rating in a country which is very much divided over many issues and concerns. And second terms are famously full of examples where presidents have all too often gone wrong. That can be explained in part because of a feeling of hubris which another four years in the White House must generate. But there are also the unexpected, the uncontrolled, and the underestimated events which can sweep over the White House like a tsunami. Nixon's fate after Watergate, Reagan's Iran-Contra Affair, and Clinton's impeachment are all permanent warning signs for future presidents as well as the current one. None of that seemed to matter to President Bush as he delivered his fifth State of the Union speech. He appeared as a confident leader, convinced of his missions to make history. The State of the Union address has to be understood as the second part of his inauguration speech. When he took the oath of office on Jan. 20, he spoke about the world and what his vision of its future should be. On Wednesday, he spent more time on the agenda he envisions for the United States, focusing particularly on the future of social security. At the inauguration, he focused on international security and how the United States has a special obligation to itself and the world to provide the framework for achieving it. He stressed that the security of the United States was dependent on the security of the rest of the world. In the State of the Union speech, he argued that Americans individual social security should be less dependent on the state and more on their own decisions and choices. Focus on the future In both speeches, the president was talking about big ideas, whether it be spreading freedom around the globe or securing the future of social security at home. With those objectives in mind, he is not thinking about the next four years. He is thinking more about the next 40. George W. Bush is attacking his second term with a recipe for radical reform, at home and abroad. His decision to go into Iraq was driven as much by the mistaken belief that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction as by the belief that a change in Iraq was the key to changing the entire Middle East. This was radical surgery, even if it was elective. The Iraqi elections serve as clear evidence for the president that his decision was the right one. During the State of the Union speech, the symbolism of American security tied to establishing Iraqi democracy was dramatically demonstrated by an American woman whose sons was killed in Fallujah embracing an Iraqi woman who had just voted in her first election. If politics is also theater, that was the high point of the show. It has been President Bush's mantra that eliminating the threat of Saddam was central to the war against terrorism and to securing peace in the Middle East. He believes that setting the basis for long-term peace beginning with Iraq will be a generational task, similar to the task facing American leadership after World War II. He made that clear in his inauguration speech as well as in the State of the Union address. He will spend the next four years trying to persuade nervous Americans and the rest of the world that this is the right course, no matter how much it costs and what sacrifices are required. Difficulties ahead The president has also decided that his legacy will not only be shaped by Iraq but also by his efforts to reshape the parameters of American social security. Known as the third rail of American politics -- a dangerous issue to touch for any politicians hoping to avoid political electrocution -- social security is the keystone of the relationship between the government and the citizen. By recommending changes in this relationship, the president is again engaged in radical surgery. Like Iraq, he sees this as a necessary step for prevention and preemption of dangers in the future. And, as with Iraq, he will be facing four years of trying to persuade Americans that these dangers are imminent and threatening. It will not be an easy path and the results are unpredictable. President Bush has enormous power, but in a second term, without the possibility of being reelected, that power will gradually wane as the search for his successor begins. In order for the president to achieve even part of his agenda, he will have to rely increasingly on his power of persuasion well beyond his loyal supporters. Second terms do not make that task easy. In over half a century, only three presidents before Bush had the opportunity to try. During the first term, President Bush seemed more inclined to use power. During the second term, he will have to get along with more persuasion. Getting the mix right will be a challenge. Jackson Janes is executive director of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at the Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C.",

"story": "WorldCom Bankruptcy Unleashes Mild Tremors in Europe German bank stocks tumbled on Monday as investors speculated that they would suffer from the collapse of the US telecom firm. But by Tuesday, most fears had been allayed. When US telecom giant WorldCom collapsed over the weekend, it awoke fears that the company's German investors and creditors would suffer as well. Speculation that major German creditors Deutsche Bank 24 and Commerzbank had given the US company a high amount of credit sent their stock prices tumbling on Monday. By Tuesday those fears had been all but brushed away. Commerzbank said it had no involvement in WorldCom. Deutsche Bank 24, WorldCom's largest German creditor, announced that it had no more than a $241 million (243 million euro) credit exposure to the telecom giant, which filed for bankruptcy in the United States on Sunday. German banks and insurers have rushed in recent days to announce they have only limited involvement in the second largest telecommunications operator in the U.S. WorldCom provided Internet services to more than 40 companies in Germany and the cities of Frankfurt, D\u00fcsseldorf and Hamburg. The company owes money to more than 60 banks across the globe, according to analysts, but few of them are in Germany. European WorldCom \"comfortable\" The company's foreign operations are not affected by the bankruptcy filing in the U.S. European WorldCom chief Lucy Woods told the Financial Times Deutschland that the company's European daughter had no plans to file bankruptcy. \"We're in a very comfortable situation,\" she said. Analysts value the US company's debt load at $30 billion. The company was forced into declaring bankruptcy after the cash flow it uses to pay debts and make investments dwindled from $2 billion three weeks ago to a mere $200 million. Havoc in the markets The filing came just weeks after the revelation of a $3.85 billion accounting scandal that wreaked havoc in the already-vulnerable telecom industry and on stock markets around the world. Both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice have opened investigations into the Mississippi-based company. The company fired Chief Financial Officer Scott Sullivan, who it said orchestrated the fraud, and hired consulting firm KPMG to sort through the mess. WorldCom stock soars in Germany Investors, at least abroad, were buoyed by news on Monday that the company plans to re-organize their operations and erase more than 75 percent of their debt. WorldCom got court approval on Monday for $2 billion in funding that it will use to restructure over the next year. WorldCom stock prices soared up to 57 percent on the Frankfurt exchange on Tuesday. The Deutsche Bank said it wasn't sure whether the credit would get repaid. News of the bank's relatively low involvement was nevertheless encouraging to investors, who pushed the stock price up by 2.4 percent in early trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on Tuesday. \u201cAfter the speculation on Monday, it was a relief for investors to know how high the bank\u2019s engagment was,\u201d analyst J\u00f6rn Kissenk\u00f6tter from the bank M.M. Warburg told Reuters.",

"story": "How 'closed communities' provide a breeding ground for radical Islam Dr. Elham Manea spent four years studying sharia councils in Britain. Talking to DW in the aftermath of the Manchester attack, she reveals how parallel societies give rise to radicalization and how to prevent it. DW: The main suspect in the Manchester bombing was born in Britain, as were the 2005 7/7 attackers and the man who crashed his car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. In the course of your research into Muslim communities in England and sharia councils, to what degree have you witnessed parallel societies with their own set of rules and behavior? Elham Manea: I prefer to use the word \"closed community\" as an expression which refers to ghettoized groups, organizing themselves along ethnic and/or religious lines. And in some European societies, specifically in Britain, they create separate cultural and social entities. They function with different cultural norms than those prevalent in British society. And talking specifically about Britain, they have parallel legal structures. Did I observe the existence of these closed communities? Yes, of course. It is a really big problem there. Read: Will Manchester change after the attack? How large are these communities? It depends. Quite often you see them like clusters in certain cities. The problem has more to do with the fact that in places like Birmingham or Bradford, you see certain areas where more than 40 percent of the population are of the Islamic faith. There is nothing wrong with having groups from different backgrounds or a certain faith. The problem is the clustering of certain ethnic groups with certain religious backgrounds in certain areas can lead to social problems - specifically with the spread of certain fundamentalist interpretations of Islam within these communities. How important is it for the more radicalized ones to stay separate from main society because they don't want to have anything to do with the \"infidels\"? I agree you have this pattern of behavior. I have to insist, nevertheless, that we ascertain that there are closed communities of other faiths in Britain, for instance the Hindus. And they also have their social problems, like gender issues and forced marriages. However, when we talk specifically about closed Islamic communities, we see the added factor of radicalization. Read: 'Heaven will wait': on the religious radicalization of young women There are systematic structures that make sure that the youth are separated from their outside environment ideologically. In Quran schools that follow the Deobandi strand of Islam and in their mosques, they tell children not to emulate the unbelievers, not to behave like them, not to love them, not to associate with them. How are you supposed to live within that society? So we can pour as much money as we want into combating violent extremism, but at the same time we seem to ignore that the nonviolent forms of Islamization are even more important. Because those who are willing to blow themselves up are at the last stage of a radicalization process. And we don't seem to want to look at what is happening before, because it would push us to raise serious questions about the type of integration, structures or policies that we have - or the lack of them. A lot of politicians do not have the courage to look at the public interest. In Britain - in other countries as well, but I am talking right now specifically about Britain - if we don't act in a way that tackles the roots of the problems, Britain will continue to be on high-alert when it comes to terrorism. And it is not coming from outside. It is coming from within. Read: Madrid to Manchester - a timeline of terror in Europe So what would be an appropriate answer? What should the politicians do in the public interest? They should insist on certain kinds of policy measures. I just mentioned Quran schools for instance. From my perspective, any self-respecting politician should insist that Quran schools be supervised by a state authority like any kindergarten. You would not allow a kindergarten that teaches hate speech. But the moment we say this about a Quran school, everybody will say this is a no-go zone. It is about time that we see which types of lessons are being taught at Quran schools, ending this ghettoization, making sure that we have some kind of infrastructure of nonviolent Islamists. These we have to really put under the microscope! What are they doing? What kind of schools are they are supporting? What kind of activities are they doing with young people? I mean, there are many questions that we have to raise. Is it fair to say that those closed societies provide a fertile ground for the type of radicalization that leads to people blowing themselves up? Yes! But I would not say that every closed community leads to radicalization. As I said, you have closed communities of other faiths. However, closed communities of the Islamic faith are more likely to experience high rates of radicalization. There was a study published this year in Britain that showed that high numbers of fighters joining Islamic State came from ghettoized communities. You even have the statistics to prove it. In these ghettoized communities, you still have very strong control by religious leaders who do not exactly set an example when it comes to tolerance. In fact, they speak of separation and very often of hatred. And they exercise control over the closed communities. That control makes it possible to spread the ideology to disillusioned youths. Dr. Elham Manea's latest book was published in 2016 under the title \"Women and Sharia Law\" and was based on four years of study of sharia councils in many Muslim communities in Great Britain.

"story": "Mercedes' Hamilton secures pole for Bahrain Grand Prix Defending Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton has claimed his fourth successive pole of the season in Bahrain. Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg came third behind Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel. Hamilton secured his first-ever time on pole in Bahrain after comprehensively outpacing all his rivals in qualifying for Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix. The British driver, the series leader with two wins from three races, came in 0.411 seconds ahead of German Sebastian Vettel, and more than half a second up on teammate Rosberg, also from Germany. Hamilton, who has had seven previous unsuccessful attempts at pole in Bahrain, laid down a glittering final lap in one minute and 32.571 after setting fastest times in all the qualifying sessions and the day's final practice session. Finn Kimi Raikkonen came in fourth in the second Ferrari, followed by compatriot Valtteri Bottas and Brazilian Felipe Massa for Williams. 'Grateful for the beast' \"I feel great. I feel very happy,\" Hamilton said after the qualifying. \"Obviously coming in to the weekend that was the target to master the track and get the car into an area that I'm happy with. I'm really grateful to have this beast underneath me to attack these corners,\" he added. Saturday's pole is the 42nd of the 30-year-old driver's career. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, Nico Huelkenberg in a Force India, Carlos Sainz Jr. in a Toro Rosso and Romain Grosjean in a Lotus make up the first ten for Sunday's race at the Bahrain International Circuit. tj/kms (dpa, AFP)",

"story": "EU takes an ethical stance on buying gold from Africa Raw materials from African conflict regions will no longer be able to be imported into the EU without controls on ethical standards. But changes will not be implemented immediately. Bernd Riegert reports from Brussels. After years of negotiation, the European Parliament, the European Commission and EU member states have finally agreed on creating laws to regulate metal imports hailing from African conflict regions. At least if the plan works, then the sale of gold, coltan, tin and tungsten, particularly from the Congo and the Great Lakes region in eastern Africa, should no longer be allowed to finance rebel groups and parties to civil war. Judith Sargentini, a Dutch parliamentarian for the Greens party, has expressed her relief over this development. \"For the first time there are binding laws on the import into the EU of minerals from conflicts areas. The European Parliament - working with the Commission in Brussels and cabinet ministers from member states - pushed for the regulations to be legally binding. Until now, Europe had only a voluntary self-regulatory system involving participating import companies. The regulations will not only be imposed on mining companies, brokers and importers of raw materials but also manufacturers of motor vehicles, electrical machinery and industrial tools. In future, proof will have to be provided that the raw materials being used have not been obtained or sold under inhuman conditions. However, it is not intended that finished products sold in shops will have special labeling indicating that human rights standards have been met. 'High time for action' For years now, the EU has implemented existing standards from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in its commercial dealings with gold, coltan, zinc and tungsten. Since 2010 a law has been in force in the US that prohibits the import of so-called \"blood\" metals and ores, particularly from the Congo and the Central African Republic. As the largest importer of African minerals, the EU is able to exercise substantial influence over the market. According to Bernd Lange of the Social Democrats, who is chairman of the European Parliament's trade commission, \"It is high time we took action and stopped turning a blind eye. But this is not the end of the road. In order to achieve success we have to be continually learning and staying flexible, so that the commercial chain, from the mine to the forge, can be monitored.\" However, Franziska \"Ska\" Keller, European parliamentarian for the Greens, is critical that the new law will not provide customers buying laptops or cell phones with information about whether \"blood\" minerals have been used in production. Only importers of raw materials are required to provide certification, not the processing factories. Exemptions are also provided for small companies. Further, gold need only be declared if amounts exceed 100kg (220 pounds) - currently worth in the region of $390,000 (369,000 euros). Raw materials that are re-used, or are already warehoused in Europe, will not fall under the new regulations. Many human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, have been calling for controls on the use of raw materials from conflict zones. A spokesperson from Amnesty has said that the organization is pleased at these recent developments in the EU, but by no means delighted: \"It is a positive, but half-hearted step. There are too many loopholes.\" Five more years During negotiations about the new law, EU member governments stressed the importance of not burdening small importers, dentists or jewelers with new bureaucracy. The European Commission has agreed to carefully observe developments in the gold market and provide warnings if irregularities occur. It will also assess whether the new laws are in fact diminishing the financial resources of rebel groups and warlords in the Congo and Great Lakes area. It is expected to be some time before the regulations come into force and make an impact in Africa. It is only in 2021 that it will become mandatory to provide proof of the origin of gold, coltan, zinc and tungsten. The sale of diamonds, perhaps the most famous of the raw materials that can be used to fund wars, are expressly not covered by the new laws.",

"story": "Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong sentenced to five years in jail A South Korean court has ruled that the 49-year-old heir to one of the world's biggest business empires paid bribes in anticipation of favors from former President Park Geun-hye, and handed him a 5-year jail sentence. A Seoul Central District Court judge on Friday found Lee guilty of corruption, hiding assets abroad and perjury, handing down a 5-year prison sentence to the Samsung vice chairman and de facto head of the country's largest company. During the two-year trial, prosecutors sought a 12-year jail term over a scandal which brought down South Korean President Park Geun-hye. Lee Jae-yong's penalty could leave the giant firm without a leader for years, and inhibit the company's ability to make key investment decisions. Samsung did not have any immediate comment. During the trial, the world's largest mobile phone maker however acknowledged it offered to donate about 43 billion won ($38 million, 32.3 million euros) to entities backed by Park's close friend, Choi Soon-sil, including sponsoring the equestrian career of Choi's daughter. The court found the money was in return for policy favors including government support for a controversial 2015 merger of two of its affiliates, which helped tighten Lee's hereditary succession at the group, after his father was left bedridden by a heart attack in 2014. The defense had denied the charges, saying Samsung was pressured by Park to make the donations under duress, and that Lee was not aware of them and did not approve them. Four other top Samsung executives were also convicted and received sentences of up to four years. Chaebols under pressure The verdict could add support to South Korea's new president, Moon Jae-in, who was campaigning on a pledge to reform the country's powerful family-owned conglomerates, also known as chaebols. Moon promised to empower minority shareholders and end the practice of pardoning corporate tycoons convicted of white-collar crime. The firms have long had dubious connections with political authorities, and past trials of their leaders have often ended with light or suspended sentences, with courts citing their contributions to the economy. The Lee clan directly owns about 5 percent of Samsung Electronics shares, but maintains its grip on the wider group through a complex web of cross-ownership stakes involving dozens of companies. South Koreans, who once applauded the chaebols for catapulting the country into a global economic power, now criticize them for holding back the economy and squeezing smaller businesses. Fallout for Samsung Lee has been Samsung's de facto leader since his father fell ill, but analysts' views about how the sentence will affect the company differ. Geoffrey Cain, the author of a forthcoming book on the group, said the company \"will not be doomed\" without Lee. \"It's up to the specialists to make their own decisions,\" he told the news agency Reuters. But Chung Sun-Sup, the head of corporate analysis firm chaebul.com, said major chaebol decisions on large-scale acquisitions or investments \"are often endorsed by the patriarch of a ruling family,\" and with Lee in prison the firm \"may move more slowly than before.\" Samsung shares have soared in recent months, but were down 1.05 percent on Friday afternoon after the verdict. The ruling is also seen as a strong indicator of the likely outcome in the trial of ex-President Park, who is facing her own corruption trial, with a ruling expected later this year. uhe/tr (Reuters, AFP, dpa)",

"story": "In Rwanda, stability trumps democracy as nation goes to polls Rwandans voted Monday in presidential elections, but the outcome is already all but certain. Critics of the government say the country may be stable but has moved far away from being a real democracy. Rwandans went to the ballot box on Monday to vote for a new president, although no one was biting their nails over the outcome - the country's sitting president, Paul Kagame, was expected to win with some 90 percent of the vote. Critics say despite its democratic appearance, the election represents just another seven-year extension of Kagame's iron-fisted rule during which Rwanda's economy has flourished, but any political opposition has been ruthlessly suppressed, turning the East African nation into what amounts to a one-party state. \"After the genocide there was the appearance to a certain extent of a liberal system, but for many years one can clearly see that it's a de facto one-party state,\" Denis Tull, an Africa expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told Deutsche Welle. \"There are a few political parties allowed, but those represented in parliament can't be considered a real opposition,\" he said. Monday's vote is the second presidential election since the country was rocked with genocidal violence in 1994 that killed some 800,000. While the country has not seen a repeat of that horror, this election run-up has been marked by a spate of arrests, mysterious killings and restrictions on the free-speech rights of critical opposition figures that could well affect the nation's long-term stability, and reopen the wounds left over from the genocide. Growth and stability Kagame's supporters, including many in the West, can point to a string of accomplishments during his 16 years at the top - 10 as president - beginning in those dark days in 1994, when he helped end the wave of killing that had wracked the country. After the genocide, the country was in ruins, today Rwanda is the safest, cleanest country in Africa, with no slums and almost no begging or street crime. Its economy is expected to grow 6 percent this year and tax revenues to increase by 12 percent. Kagame has positioned himself as a foe of corruption which has attracted donors and private investors, including big names like Starbucks and the Gulf investment firm Dubai World. Berlin-based corruption watchdog Transparency International ranks Rwanda as the least corrupt country in East Africa. The World Bank puts the country among the top five most attractive African nations to do business. Kagame's popularity with foreign donors has meant the country's food stocks are swelling, the Chinese have built a basic road network and South Korea is laying a fiber-optic system across the country. His ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front party has overseen a trebling of household incomes and today citizens have access to universal health insurance and the country's parliament has a higher percentage of female members than anywhere else in the world - 56 percent. \"I will continue to work as hard as I can till the day we can speak of a Rwanda that has achieved the kind of prosperity that leaves no one behind and everyone proud of who they are,\" Kagame wrote in a letter to supporters posted on his website Friday. The other side of the coin But there is a dark side to Kagame's rule, critics say, charging that all the stability has came at a high price - human rights. Over the last few months, a string of attacks on Rwandans with whom the president has fallen out has raised eyebrows and suspicions. Opposition politicians and independent journalists have been harassed, arrested, or worse. Police have arrested two aspiring presidential candidates and opposition supporters have been detained for holding an illegal rally. Victoire Ingabire, a Hutu politician who had hoped to stand against Kagame, must face charges of \"denying the genocide\" while in exile. General Faustin Kayumba Nyamwasa, a critic Kagame, fled his homeland in February and was shot in the stomach in June in South Africa. The deputy editor of a critical newspaper was recently shot and killed outside his home in the capital Kigali. Andre Kagwa Rwisereka, the deputy leader of the opposition Democratic Green Party of Rwanda, was found nearly decapitated in the south of the country. \"We have stability here and you can see economic improvement. But we don't think it's sustainable, because we say stability and democracy must go hand and hand,\" Frank Habineza, president of Rwanda's Green Party, told Deutsche Welle by telephone from Kigali. He said he himself was threatened by unnamed men in February who he suspects of being government security operatives. \"We know Kagame's party is going to win this election, because the president is very prepared and he has no competition at all,\" he added. \"This election is an election where there is no opposition.\" Kagame won a 2003 presidential election with 95 percent of the vote. This time around, he faces three opponents who backed him seven years ago. Western support Despite the recent events, all of which the government denies having any role in, Rwanda still enjoys a good deal of enthusiastic Western support since the country is seen as something of a model for the continent. Kagame's list of advisors includes Tony Blair, Bill Clinton, high-profile US evangelist Rick Warren and the CEOs of Google and Starbucks. It also helps that Kagame, 52, is an elegant, charismatic figure, who speaks well and knows how to court international players. Over the past few weeks, Kagame has responded to allegations about democratic deficits by saying democracy in Rwanda takes time to establish, stability is the priority, especially given the convulsion of 1994. \"Your model of democracy, why should it be suitable for me,\" he told Britain's Guardian newspaper. Foreign governments and advisors have been mostly quiet about the rights situation, despite the fact that Rwanda is ranked 183 out of 195 countries for freedom of the press. According to analyst Tull, that is partly due to the fact that Kagame, the rebel army leader who stopped the genocide, has successfully played on Western guilt about its non-intervention during the killing. \"The government is saying, we have other goals, like stability and development, and we won't be told by others how to lead our country, especially by an international community which didn't intervene to stop the genocide,\" he said. \"That is the message and it's getting across fairly well because we haven't seen that much criticism from outside.\" Author: Kyle James Editor: Rob Mudge",

"story": "German Seniors Say No to Nursing Homes Members of Germany older generation are looking at new models of living for their retirement years. They want security, comfort and social contacts; they don\u2019t want a nursing home. Senior flat shares fit that bill. On the eighth floor of a Dresden high-rise, 72-year-old Karl-Heinz R\u00f6ttjer can look out from his small, one-bedroom apartment and see a good portion of the city and the hills that spill over into the Czech Republic. To him, the wide-open vista represents freedom, and the new lease on life he has gotten since moving in with five retired women to share his sunset years. \"Here I feel much better, I can spend my time how I want,\" he said. \"I feel free, and it's like I have a family around me.\" He cherishes that freedom since it was taken away from him for a while. He was put in a nursing home after an illness made him unable to live alone anymore several years ago. His wife had died and his children had moved away. But for this spry, independent septuagenarian, it was like being put in prison. \"In a nursing home, you're not your own master,\" he said. \"There are rules to follow and you've subject to strict schedules. Everything's planned out and you feel almost trapped.\" So he escaped, not by climbing out an open window, but by answering an ad for a living arrangement that experts say could become a common alternative for older people in the future: a senior flat share. Not long after, he moved into the specially modified suite of apartments and hasn't looked back. Communal living but privacy, too The senior flat share, however, is generally not like the basic college-age roommate situation. R\u00f6ttjer has his own apartment with a kitchen and bathroom, as does each of his five flatmates. They provide privacy and independence which are important to older people. But there is also a common room with comfortable furniture, a dining table and a TV, plus a communal kitchen and dining table where people can prepare and eat shared meals if they want. The Dresden suite also has a large bathroom that has been outfitted with special aid devices for when age makes getting around, or in and out of the bathtub, more difficult. There are at least 200 similar experiments in senior living across Germany as the older generation rethinks how they want to live out their sunset years and more are popping up all the time. The senior living arrangement was even the topic of a reality TV show on the German-French channel arte, which brought five women between 60 and 70 together in a Berlin apartment and followed the ups and downs of their new lives there. Surveys have found that more than two-thirds of people now over the age of 40 have no interest in going into an old age home in the future. \"My generation does not want to go into these so-called social institutions for old, helpless people,\" said Heike Gr\u00fcnewald, who heads Projekt 50 Plus, a Berlin-based group which tries to match up seniors and communal living arrangements. \"We do not want the state looking after us. Besides, the state will not have any money to do it, so we have to look after ourselves.\" Greying society Germany's older population is set to skyrocket over the next decades. Demographers forecast that by 2050, more than one in three Germans will be over 60. While most European societies are getting older, in 30 years, due to low birth rates and longer life spans, it is predicted that Germany will have the oldest population in the world. \"That means we have to look at and encourage these different models of senior living,\" said Irmingard Schewe-Gerigk, a parliamentarian for the Green party who looks at aging issues. Germany's system for financing care for older people is fast running short of cash. The government pays for part or all of nursing home care, which is expensive, so it's beginning to show interest in the alternatives. One study has shown that having a senior in an apartment share can save the government more than 51,000 euros ($66,000) a year. In the Dresden flat share, each resident pays between 270 to 390 euros rent to a real estate developer who renovated the apartment. \"In a flat share, people do just fine with their own money, they're able to manage,\" said Sieglinde Wartenberg, who arranges senior apartment shares in Dresden. \"They can get by on just a little money, and age with dignity.\" Social connection Besides the financial aspect, there's a social element of living with others that is just as, if not more, important for older people. One of the greatest fears of the elderly is social isolation. \"At some point, you feel that you just aren't needed,\" said Irene Rostalskie, 72. \"Hardly anyone has time for you anymore.\" She raised six children, but one by one they moved away until she was alone in her ground-floor apartment. One day someone broke her window and she felt not only alone, but insecure. The flat share solves both of those problems. \"It's one of the main advantages to this living arrangement, there's always someone there who I can ring up or go see,\" said Richard Palm, head of the Forum for Communal Living. \"If I'm feeling sick, there will be someone coming and saying, should I get you a newspaper or call a doctor.\" Around the common table in the suite, the flatmates joke and laugh like teenagers while they offer visitors coffee and cake. They make sure all guests write their names in a black notebook they keep; last year, there were 47 entries. The flatmates often take group day trips around the regions, visiting neighboring towns or going to the theater. \"In a nursing home, you get old very quickly,\" said Sylvia Behrens, who at 57 is the youngest of the group, but who suffers from Parkinson's disease and has been in several living arrangements since she was diagnosed. \"Here, you feel young again,\" she said.",

"story": "EU to sign off on 1-billion-euro aid pledge to Afghanistan Representatives from 70 countries are set to attend a two-day summit in Brussels to agree on a new aid package for Afghanistan. Ahead of the meeting, the EU sealed a deal to return failed Afghan asylum seekers. The two-day international aid conference in Brussels, which kicks off on Tuesday, is expected to see the EU pledge a total of 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) a year to Afghanistan until 2020. Ahead of the summit, the European Commission said it would commit an extra 200 million euros ($224 million) a year to strengthen state structures in the war-ravaged country. In a statement, the Commission said the funds could be used by the Kabul government \"to finance their own strategic development priorities.\" Dozens of other countries - including the US, Russia, China and India - are also expected to increase their aid commitment to Afghanistan, which is not able to fully support itself after four decades of conflict, and amid a resurgence of the Taliban. As well as seeking a total of 2.68 billion euros a year for the next four years, EU leaders said the meeting would also push for a realistic time frame for a peace process. That fundraising figure is lower because Afghanistan has begun raising its own revenues, but also due to so-called donor fatigue amid multiple high-profile conflicts. Deal to return failed asylum seekers Earlier Monday, the EU sealed a deal with the Afghan government to speed up the deportation of Afghan citizens who do not qualify for asylum in the bloc. Under the plan, the EU will bear the costs of returning the migrants, including travel expenses and re-integration programs, while Kabul has promised to readmit citizens and supply travel documents for migrants without papers within a month. The EU said special cases, such as single women, unaccompanied minors, the old and the sick can only be deported if they have families to return to and their safety can be guaranteed. Germany, which has accommodated more Afghan migrantsthan any other European country, signed a similar deal with the Kabul government on Sunday that will see thousands of failed asylum seekers return home. Observers said the larger EU aid package did not appear to be conditional for accepting the return of migrants. Around 1.2 million Afghans are living as refugees in their own country and another 3 million are living in Iran, Pakistan or seeking asylum in Europe. mm/cmk (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

"story": "European Press Review: It\u2019s All Greek To Me European newspaper editors led on Friday with editorials on the EU\u2019s Thessaloniki summit and the growing problems American and British forces are having maintaining order in Iraq. With the leaders of the European Union meeting at a major summit, newspapers in European capitals on Friday commented on the major political issues being discussed at in Thessaloniki, Greece, as well as the hangover facing U.S. and British troops in Iraq. London\u2019s Financial Times looked at British Prime Minister Tony Blair\u2019s proposals for EU immigration policies and noted: \u201cBack in 1999 EU states set themselves the goal of creating a common system of asylum, now a common European approach is being attempted towards some of the roots of the refugee problem which of course lie outside the Union.\u201d And who is leading the approach, the paper asked? \u201cIt is none other than Britain which during the 1990s in the name of national sovereignty fought German efforts to bring the EU into asylum policy.\u201d According to the paper, the reason for the switch was obvious: \u201cBritain has replaced Germany as the largest single EU destination for asylum seekers.\u201d France\u2019s Le Figaro focused on the first formal talks on a European constitution taking place at the Greek summit. \u201cAn EU constitution will make the cooperation between member states much easier in many fields,\u201d the paper said. It also saw a further opportunity arising out of the summit, suggesting: \u201cAfter the conflict about the war in Iraq not only do transatlantic relations have to be redefined, it is even more important for the EU states to formulate a common position towards Washington.\u201d Commenting on claims that the U.S. and Britain exaggerated the threat posed by Saddam Hussein\u2019s weapon\u2019s arsenal before the war, the Italian daily Corriere Della Sera noted that the opponents of the war also made mistakes. \u201cThey predicted millions of refugees and hundreds of thousands of dead,\u201d the paper wrote, \u201cthey spoke of legions of guerrilla fighters who would join Hussein\u2019s Republican Guards and they repeatedly predicted that the ordinary people would rise up.\u201d But none of these fears ever came true, the paper pointed out. The Munich-based S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung noted that there was one aspect that might endanger the Bush administration even more than Saddam\u2019s vanished weapons of mass destruction \u2013 and that is Iraqi resistance that is leading to the murder of American soldiers almost every day. \u201cFirst, American troops are to be worn down and therefore provoked to take ill-considered actions against civilians. Secondly, back in the U.S., doubts are to be planted about why young American men and women must risk their lives for a people that seems to be so ungrateful,\u201d the paper wrote. Finally, the paper said the Iraqi resistance was pursuing a third goal: It wants to keep alive fear of Saddam and the revenge he will take if he returns. \u201cIt is not a coincidence,\u201d the paper concluded, \u201cthat the resistance carries the name \u201cAl Auda\u201d \u2013 the return.\u201d The editors of Strasbourg\u2019s La Derniere Nouvelles D\u2019Alsace had an altogether different take. The resistance, they concluded, is not pursuing any precise military goals; nor is it comprised of fanatic adherents to Saddam\u2019s Baath Party. Instead, the paper wrote, the attacks by Iraqi resistance fighters against U.S. troops is merely a result of the prevailing anarchy in the country and the hostility of the Iraqi population toward the occupying powers.",

"story": "Love and Betrayal in the Animal Kingdom In its latest major show, the German Hygiene Museum in Dresden is exploring the contradictory relationship between people and animals. We love animals, but we also kill them. We cuddle them, but we also hunt them. We revere them, but we also use them. We mass produce livestock, we keep house pets, we go on luxury safaris and, at the same time, we protect endangered species. The list of incredible contradictions in the relationship between humans and the animal kingdom seems endless and is now the focus of a new exhibit at the German Hygiene Museum in Dresden titled, \"Man and Animals: Scenes from a Paradoxical Relationship\". The exhibit begins in a dimly-lit room. Loud speakers pipe out the sounds of many different types of animals. Hundreds of rubber animals are held in a case behind small Adam and Eve figures. It's clear from the beginning that the show's creators have also infused a dose of humor into a provocative and deep subject. Tough moral questions \"The exhibit is really about the self-image of humans,\" says curator Jasdan Joerges. \"What's so distinguishing about humans? What makes them human? Who wears the crown of creation? Will animals in the future need a bigger divide from humans? Do we need new ethics for an animal of the future? These are the kinds of questions this exhibit deals with.\" Animals are a central component of human culture and civilization. Without them, we humans never would have become what we are today. The first thematic block of the exhibit, under the title \"Beloved Animals,\" examines that motif. The wide-reaching exhibit covers everything from hunting as an existential necessity to killing for sport, to the exotic menageries kept by European dynasties to today's zoos, which have become the last refuges for some endangered species. From the everyday to the bizarre The Hygiene Museum also devotes considerable space to examining the complex relationship between humans and their pets. \"The rank of house pets as a social and economic factor is enormous,\" says Joerges. \"It's a billion euro industry. We show everything here from jars from Germany's first blood bank for dogs to animal coffins to wedding dresses for dogs to fish-flavored toothpaste for cats to a model used to teach mouth-to-snout CPR.\" The show brings together more than 750 artifacts including paintings, films, stuffed animals and everyday objects. It also includes its share of strange stuff, like a real elephant foot that was made into a trash can and given to former East German President Wilhelm Pieck on the occasion of his 80th birthday. All of the exhibits are displayed behind a wire-netting fence, which is meant to symbolize the border between humans and animals. A world divided The fence is omnipresent in the first three sections of the exhibit, signifying how humans have tinkered with animals and sought to perfect certain species over thousands of years. We've used genetic engineering to add ribs in order to produce more meat cutlets and we've devised technical equipment that guarantees the continued existence of breeding animals. But it also leaves you asking yourself exactly the questions the curators intended. How far should humans be able to go in their relationships with animals? Should humans be able to experiment with animals that the latest scientific discoveries show share most of our genes? The exhibit doesn't try to answer any of these questions -- it merely poses them. \"Man and Animal\" runs through August 10, 2003, at the Deutsches Hygiene Museum, located at Lingnerplatz 1 in Dresden.",

"story": "\u00d6zel: 'Erdogan doesn't care about laws' Recep Tayyip Erdogan is going to meddle with Turkish domestic and foreign politics despite his role as president traditionally being a politically neutral one, says political scientist and columnist Soli \u00d6zel. DW: Why did Recep Tayyip Erdogan choose Ahmet Davutoglu as his successor as prime minister and chairman of his Justice and Development Party (AKP)? Soli \u00d6zel: It was Erdogan's goal to get rid of politicians who had their own power base within the AKP. Ahmet Davutoglu represents a \"new generation.\" He doesn't have even close to the standing in the party that would allow for an unchallenged position. You can rest assured that there was a deal between Erdogan and Davutoglu. Davutoglu is going to be a far weaker prime minister compared to Erdogan. Is Erdogan going to weaken his own party in the long run by appointing Davutoglu? It would be impossible for anyone to replace someone like Erdogan. As far as next year's parliamentary elections are concerned: Since Erdogan doesn't care about laws anyway, he is going to massively interfere in election campaigns and act as if he was still the AKP's chairman. How are the new Turkish government's policies going to differ from previous administrations? Erdogan will especially be able to exert his influence when it comes to foreign policy. If Hakan Fidan, the head of Turkey's intelligence service and one of Erdogan's closest allies, becomes foreign minister, Erdogan is also going to meddle with foreign affairs - there has never been something like that! [Turkey's] foreign policy of the past years is really nothing to be proud of. Just look at how [Turkey] deals with IS fighters. At least we are giving them a hard time now to a certain extent. When it comes to Israel, there had been efforts to approach one another again. But the Gaza conflict has destroyed these plans again. Relations with the United States are tense, but one has to say that the US probably doesn't have any other choice than to work closely with Turkey. Relations to Egypt are a different story: they will probably remain damaged for the long term. Has Turkey's recent foreign policy damaged Turkey's image abroad? You can see how badly Turkey's reputation has been damaged by looking at the guest list for the president's inauguration ceremony. It really isn't the vanguard of international politics. It will take a while until Erdogan can travel to other countries. In the end, he will of course do that. Countries have relations with one another, regardless of whether the heads of state like each other on a personal level. Erdogan has managed to get on the bad side of many Arab as well as European states. On the other hand, countries are going to have to receive him. As far as relations with the European Union are concerned: Turkey's reputation resembles more that of Hungary than that of Croatia. Do you think Turkey's international image is threatened in the long run? Turkey is quite fortunate and has a unique geographical position. That's one of its biggest advantages. That means as long as Turkey remains a NATO member, and as long as there are many problems in Turkey's neighboring countries, Turkey is going to play an important role. What does the Turkish opposition do in order to stand up to the AKP? The opposition doesn't do anything. And it won't do anything until next elections are over. Maybe it's going to pull itself together after the next elections. But Turkey's political landscape won't change in the long run. I'm referring particularly to the Republican People's Party (CHP) and the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) - these institutionalized opposition parties. They simply don't have any meaning. How do you assess the role of the new pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP)? The HDP is still limited in its political scope of action by its political roots. I think presidential candidate Selahattin Demirtas campaigned well. Despite the fact that he had very little financial resources, he managed to get almost 10 percent of the votes. That's quite impressive. This result is likely not going to be replicated in next year's parliamentary elections. But it showed that there is potential for a new political power in Turkey in the future. What do you make of the role of outgoing President Abdullah Gul in this political power game of the past months? He's missed a great chance to develop his own position in Turkey's political landscape. He is now being chased out of office in a very dishonorable way. Erdogan wanted to keep him from becoming prime minister. That's why this election was scheduled in a way that Gul wasn't able to participate, since he was still president. That's really a disrespectful treatment of a president. In the end, this only fuels my suspicion that Erdogan doesn't allow anyone who could potentially turn into a competitor near him. Soli \u00d6zel is a professor of international relations at Istanbul's Kadir Has University. He also works as a political advisor and has his own column in Turkey's daily \"Haberturk.\"",

"story": "Dortmund in tough Champions League group Borussia Dortmund face a tough task to improve on last year's disappointing Champions League campaign after being given a tough group Thursday. Afterwards, Barcelona's Andres Iniesta was named Best Footballer in Europe. Defending Bundesliga champions Borussia Dortmund were dealt a tough hand Thursday at the 2012-13 UEFA Champions League Group Stage draw in Monaco. Last year's league and cup double winners will participate in a Group D that includes Real Madrid, Manchester City and Ajax. 2012 finalists Bayern were drawn with Valencia, Lille and BATE Borisov of Belarus in Group F. Schalke mark their return to Europe's premier competition in Group B, joining Arsenal, Olympiacos, and reigning French champions Montpellier. Qualifying rounds for the Champions League began in June, during the European Championships. Seventy-six teams from 52 different national associations enter the competition, but only 32 remain by the time the Group Stage begins in September. Tough Group D Dortmund would certainly have been hoping for a better draw after disappointingly crashing out of the group stage last year with just one win. Facing nine-time champions Real Madrid and defending English Premier League champions Manchester City means advancing to the knockout stage will be a difficult challenge for the German team. Madrid attacker Cristiano Ronaldo called it \"the most difficult group\", with all three teams making improvements since last season. The Spanish club made the biggest move by signing Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Luka Modric for 35 million Euros ($43.81 million) Monday. Dortmund coach J\u00fcrgen Klopp did not get caught up in the star power of the group. \"We don't feel like we have to compete with them in terms of who is prettier, who is bigger, or who is better,\" he said. \"But rather we want to be their most unpleasant opponent on the day.\" \"Obviously it is always a great experience to be able to play in Estadio Santiago Bernabeu or on English soil,\" said Captain Sebastian Kehl. \"But I have to honestly say, I was hoping for one of the easier [groups].\" Schalke mark European return Schalke are returning to the Champions League for the first time since reaching the semifinals in 2011. With Raul no longer in the squad, the Gelsenkirchen club have a redeveloped attack lead by Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Jose Manuel Jurado and Julian Draxler. \"It is a really interesting group,\" said Schalke Captain Benedikt H\u00f6wedes. \"I am especially looking forward to the duel against Arsenal. Two players who I really understand well play there in Lukas Podolski and Per Mertersacker.\" Domestic rivals Bayern will be feeling confident of their chances. The Bavarian club were the first name to be drawn at the event, placing them in Group F. They will hope to do one better this season after falling in the final on penalties to Chelsea at their home ground in Munich. Germany's fourth team participating in the competition, Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, were eliminated late Wednesday night after falling to Dynamo Kyiv 4-3 on aggregate. The Ukrainian club went on to be drawn in Group A with FC Porto, Dinamo Zagreb and Paris St. Germain. Four German teams have returned to the competition after the Bundesliga moved up in UEFA's league rankings. Previously Germany qualified just three teams into the Champions League. Iniesta named Best Footballer in Europe Barcelona and Spain midfielder Andres Iniesta was named Best Footballer in Europe Thursday evening. He was given the award by journalists from UEFA's 53 member countries in a live poll after the Champions League Group Stage draw in Monaco. The 28-year-old beat out favorites Lionel Messi, last year's winner, and Cristiano Ronaldo to collect the honor for the first time. Iniesta helped lead Spain to their second consecutive European Championship title this summer in Ukraine and Poland. He was named player of the tournament. Real Madrid midfielder Mesut \u00d6zil was the only German player to make the top ten list for the award.",

"story": "On the spot: Paulo Guerrero Now a regular starter at Hamburg, the Peruvian striker spent two years on Bayern's bench. Guerrero hasn't made Hamburg fans forget club legend Uwe Seeler, but he doesn't put much stock in older role models. DWTV: Whose posters did you have in your room as a boy? Paulo Guerrero: I didn't like posters. DWTV: Stickers maybe? Paulo Guerrero: No. But I am a big fan of Zinedine Zidane, Thierry Henry and Ronaldo. They always fascinated me. They're my role models. DWTV: Hopefully you won't cut your hair like Ronaldo. Paulo Guerrero: No, everyone has their own look Guerrero not only has the hair, he's got the game too. He showed that by scoring five goals in his first four games for Bayern back in 2004. But he's never really managed to match that fantastic form since. Known as a shy and reserved player, he says the key to finding the net is confidence. Paulo Guerrero: I had already scored 21 goals for Bayern Munich's amateur side. I was very proud of that. So I came into those games with a lot of confidence, and the goals just happened. My coach Felix Magath always told me: Score your goal, score your goal! That's all he asked, for me to score a goal. And I believed in myself so I always scored one or two. DWTV: At the age of 18 you joined a squad full of stars like Michael Ballack, Lucio, Ze Roberto and Roy Makaay. Was that more intimidating or inspiring? Paulo Guerrero: They inspired me. They were very good players technically. I wanted to play at their level and get better. That also gave me the confidence to play alongside them. DWTV: You didn't start for Bayern so you went to Hamburg. But you had trouble there at first? Why was that? Paulo Guerrero: It was very hard for me to leave Bayern. It was very difficult after four years. I left my son and many of my friends behind. The first year in Hamburg was very hard. In my mind, I was still in Munich. I kept asking myself: \"Why did you come here?\" It was hard to get used to a new city so my first year at Hamburg wasn't that successful. DWTV: Was coach Thomas Doll part of the problem? Paulo Guerrero: No, definitely not. It wasn't the coach's fault. It was mine. I didn't have enough experience. I was only 22. It was hard, but that's in the past. Now I'm living in the present and I'm very happy in Hamburg. 2007/8 was Guerrero's breakthrough season. He scored 9 league goals and 5 in the UEFA Cup. And this time around his sights are set even higher. DWTV: Can Hamburg win the league this season? Paulo Guerrero: Most of our players are young and hungry for success. They want to get the job done. A lot of players here have attracted attention to themselves and play at a high level. In my opinion, we could win the title this year. DWTV: Do you have a clear target for the UEFA Cup? Paulo Guerrero: Of course. Last season we almost made the final and we put up a good fight in the Bundesliga too. We get along well as a team. We've got players with potential and we're hungry for success. Even as a teenager, Guerrero played for the national side in his native Peru. His first goal came as a substitute, but he's been a consistent member of the squad. DWTV: So what's more important to you, club or country? Paulo Guerrero: It's very different playing for Peru than playing for a club. You're not allowed to lose. I don't want to lose with Hamburg either, but when I put on the Peruvian jersey it's very different. Those are my people, my stadium. It's great playing in front of the crowd in Lima. What player doesn't want to play for his national side? DWTV: A lot of Latin American players dream of coming to Europe, something you did as a youngster. Wouldn't you have liked to play professionally in Peru as well? Paulo Guerrero: Of course, I would have, but Peruvian football isn't doing so well. There's no progress in the management, infrastructure and organization. In Europe, the situation is the opposite. So my parents always though I should go to Europe as soon as I got an offer.",

"story": "Return of 'Baby Doc' Duvalier adds further confusion in Haiti Former Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier is back in Haiti after a quarter century of French exile. Deutsche Welle looks back at his past and explores what his return could mean for the troubled island nation. Duvalier arrived back in his homeland on Sunday and Haitian media were immediately dominated by the news of his return. Duvalier has not said much about his motivation other than a few scarcely audible statements on Haitian radio to the effect that he wants to help. A press conference was repeatedly postponed and has been rescheduled for Tuesday. His return came as something of a surprise, but supporters were informed in advance and turned out in droves at Port-au-Prince's airport to greet and cheer the former dictator. \"It's a victory, almost exactly 25 years after he left the country,\" one of them told reporters. \"According to our constitution, he should only have spent 10 years in exile. He waited longer than that, but now he's back again.\" Duvalier was overthrown by a popular uprising in 1986. And large numbers of Haitians - as well the vast majority of the international community - are not at all enthused about Baby Doc's return. Dark chapter of history In particular, human rights organizations are appalled by the thought of Duvalier once again playing a role in Haitian politics. 'Baby Doc,' as the former dictator is nicknamed, and his father Francois 'Papa Doc' Duvalier are thought to have committed numerous human rights offenses, including the murder of tens of thousands of Haitians, between 1957 and 1986 when they ruled the country. \"During [Jean-Claude Duvalier's] regime, there was torture, people were imprisoned for political reasons, opposition figures were murdered or disappeared, and women were raped,\" said Gerardo Ducas, a Haiti expert at Amnesty International. \"There's a long list of human rights violations for which Jean-Claude Duvalier should be called to answer for in front of a Haitian court.\" But the Haitian judiciary has yet to move against the former dictator. And given the chaotic situation in Haiti at present, it is hard to imagine any concerted efforts being made toward his arrest. Not only is the country still trying to recover from the devastating effects of last year's earthquake. Haitian politics are also in turmoil since an inconclusive and possibly corrupt election in late November. No final results from that vote have been published, nor any date set for a run-off election, leaving current president Rene Preval in office for the foreseeable future. Rampant speculations At present, no one knows why, or at whose behest, Duvalier chose this particular moment to return to Haiti. According to an article in Mother Jones magazine, Haitian media as well as ordinary people on the street think his return was engineered by France and the United States, as a means of putting pressure on Preval. Journalist Amy Wilentz, who spent time in Haiti under the Baby Doc regime, also thinks the timing of his return is anything but arbitrary. \"I don't think this man should have anything to do with Haitian politics,\" Wilentz said. \"Merely by setting foot in the country he raises a lot of political questions. Somebody let him back in; somebody gave him the okay. It seems inconceivable that he's coming home to retire. So he's coming home to exert some kind of political influence.\" But others believe that Baby Doc has only returned to Haiti to secure his family fortune. And there's even a rumor that he returned solely to renew his passport and that he already has a return ticket to Paris, booked for the end of this week. The coming days and weeks will tell what political agenda, if any, Duvalier is pursuing. One thing, however, is certain. His return has added an extra bit of political confusion at a time when Haiti can ill afford any potentially incendiary distractions. Author: Martin Polansky (jc) Editor: Rob Mudge",

"story": "British air traffic disrupted by computer glitch Flights in an out of London have been disrupted by a computer failure at an air traffic control center in southern England. Aviation officials, however, have said the problem has been resolved. The National Air Traffic Service, (NATS) announced on Friday evening that a technical problem, which had forced it to briefly shut down the airspace over the British capital, had been fixed and service was returning to normal. NATS also said the problem had been caused by a computer failure at its air traffic control center at Swanwick in the south of England (pictured above). \"We apologise for any delays and the inconvenience this may have caused,\" a statement posted on the NATS website said. It also advised passengers planning to fly in or out of London on Friday evening to contact their airline for the status of their flight before making their way to the airport. Heathrow Airport, which is Europe's busiest air travel hub in terms of volume of passenger traffic, reported that no flights were landing or taking off while the airspace over London was shut down. Later, the flight-tracking service FlightAware reported that it had noticed some delays but few cancellations at Heathrow. Service was also briefly shut down at London's other four airports, Gatwick, Stansted, London City and Luton. Airports beyond Greater London were not affected by the problem and both Manchester and Birmingham declared that they were prepared to receive diverted flights. No details of the nature of the computer failure that caused the disruption were immediately available. However, Reuters news agency citied an unnamed British government source who said it did not appear to be related to a security threat. Swanwick no stranger to computer glitches The Swanwick air traffic control center has experienced problems in the past. Last December, the night-operating system at Swanwick failed to properly switch over to daytime mode, causing delays for thousands of passengers. Computer problems at the Swanwick center also grounded scores of flights and inconvenienced thousands of travelers in incidents in 2004 and 2008. In the aftermath of the latest glitch, British Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin released a statement saying that he had demanded an explanation for what he termed \"simply unacceptable\" disruption. \"Any disruption to our aviation system is a matter of the utmost concern, especially at this time of year in the run up to the holiday season,\" he said. \"I also want to know what steps will be taken to prevent this happening again,\" he added. pfd/sms (Reuters, AP, dpa)",

"story": "German man admits fathering children with stepdaughter in incest case A German man has told a court he fathered seven children with his stepdaughter. He has denied, however, charges of rape and abuse of the girl and two other children. In a case that has shocked the country, a German man admitted Tuesday to fathering seven children with his stepdaughter, but denied raping her and beating his stepson and biological daughter. The 48-year-old, identified as Detlef S., stands accused of raping and brutally abusing the stepdaughter and of abusing the stepson and biological daughter. He faces 350 counts of sexual assault and grievous sexual assault of minors over a period of more than two decades. According to the official charge sheet, the man is accused of first sexually abusing his biological daughter, now in her 20s, when she was nine years old and of abusing her from the age of 12. Public prosecutor Thorsten Kahl said Detlef S. used to beat the three children, and he is also accused of prostituting the daughter and stepdaughter for financial gain. \"I hope he gets the right sentence and that he can never hurt anyone again,\" his stepdaughter told reporters as the trial opened. 'The German Fritzl' In a statement read by his lawyer to a court in the western city of Koblenz, Detlef S. admitted to being the father of the stepdaughter's children, but \"denied the charges made against him.\" Detlef S. faces 15 years behind bars if found guilty. A verdict is expected on February 25. The German media have likened the case to that of Austrian Josef Fritzl, who was sentenced to life in prison in 2009 for holding his daughter in a cramped dungeon for 24 years as a sex slave and fathering seven children with her.

"story": "Germany's DFB admits 2005 FIFA payment, denies World Cup link The German Football Federation (DFB) has said a payment it made to FIFA had nothing to do with the awarding of the 2006 World Cup to Germany. News magazine Der Spiegel claims a slush fund was used to secure votes. Football's German governing body said on Friday it had found no \"irregularities\" in the awarding of football's showpiece event to Germany. \"Furthermore, there is no evidence that any of the delegates' votes were won illegally at any stage in the application process,\" a DFB statement said. However, the DFB said it had become aware of a 6.7 million euro payment - brought to light by an internal investigation. The sum was paid to FIFA in April 2005 from the organizational committee preparing the event in Germany. \"This payment was in no way linked to the awarding of the 2006 World Cup, which had been decided 5 years previously,\" said the statement, albeit acknowleding that the money might not have been used as intended. According to the DPA news agency, FIFA has said it will investigate the possible improper use of the payment. Swiss prosecutors are currently investigating accusations in the selection of Russia and Qatar as the venues for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Delegates 'bought off' News magazine Der Spiegel reported on Friday that the bid committee had set up a slush fund of 10.3 million Swiss francs ($10.8 million) to help it land the event. A report on the magazine's website on Friday said the money was used to secure the votes of four Asian FIFA delegates who were involved in awarding the World Cup. Der Spiegel said the money had come from Adidas boss Robert Louis-Dreyfus as a secret private donation. The magazine said the bid committee chief Franz Beckenbauer and the current DFB president Wolfgang Niersbach were aware that there was a fund. Germany narrowly pipped South Africa by 12 votes to 11 in the vote by the FIFA executive committee in 2009. Oceania's Charles Dempsey abstained from the ballot and said there had been huge pressure on him from undisclosed parties. Niersabach famously said in a German TV interview a few months ago that he did not know how Germany had won enough votes to tip the scales. The sum was said to have been sent to FIFA for a cultural event. In the end, that event was cancelled. The DFB has said it will look into a possible claim to potential repayment. FIFA, meanwhile, said it had forwarded the case to its audit and compliance commission. rc/msh (dpa, Reuters)",

"story": "'Mad Men' creator, Audrey Tautou on Berlinale jury The seven members of this year's Berlinale jury have been named. The experienced film celebrities will decide who will receive the prestigious Golden Bear in mid-February. The American filmmaker Darren Aronofsky, who directed the 2014 blockbuster \"Noah,\" \"Black Swan\" and \"The Wrestler,\" among others, will preside over the jury. He will be accompanied by French actress Audrey Tautou (who rose to fame with her eccentric character in the global hit, \"Am\u00e9lie\") and German actor Daniel Br\u00fchl (who played the lead role in \"Good Bye, Lenin!\"), as well as Matthew Weiner, the creator, executive producer and screenwriter of the hit US series \"Mad Men.\" Other jurors include Martha De Laurentiis (\"Hannibal\") and South Korean director Bong Joon-ho (\"Snowpiercer\"). The Peruvian filmmaker Claudia Llosa, who won the Golden Bear in 2009 with her film \"The Milk of Sorrow,\" is also on board. Festival director Dieter Kosslick pointed out during a press conference that this year's selection includes many films depicting \"strong women in extreme situations.\" Opening the festival is a film by Spanish director Isabel Coixet - \"Nobody Wants the Night\" - featuring French actress Juliette Binoche. It tells the story of Josephine Peary, who trekked across the tundra in Greenland in 1908 to rescue her missing husband. Werner Herzog's \"Queen of the Desert\" also highlights a forceful woman's biography, with Nicole Kidman portraying British explorer and spy Gertrude Bell. Another awaited premiere is Terrence Malick's latest feature, called \"Knight of Cups,\" and dissident Iranian director Jafar Panahi's \"Taxi.\" Altogether, 19 films are competing for the Golden Bear this year and 441 movies from 72 countries will be shown within 10 days. The Berlin International Film Festival, known as the Berlinale, will take place from February 5 to 15 in the German capital. eg/kbm (dpa, AFP)",

"story": "Schalke knocked out by Ajax in Europa League thriller   Goals from Leon Goretzka, Guido Burgstaller and Daniel Caligiuri looked to be sending Schalke through to the semifinals. But Ajax hit back twice in extra time and progressed on aggregate.   Schalke 3-2 Ajax AET. (Ajax win 4-3 on aggregate) (Goretzka 53', Burgstaller 56', Caliguiri 101' - Viergever 111', Younes 120') Heartbreak for Schalke. They produced a fantastic fightback and were in touching distance of reaching the semifinals before their dream died in a flash as Ajax netted a crucial away goal in extra time and then added another late on. Markus Weinzierl's side had powered their way back into the tie after an insipid 2-0 defeat at Ajax last week thanks to a magical three-minute burst after the break. First Goretzka thrashed home on 53 minutes after storming up field and getting a cute return pass from Burgstaller and soon after, the Austria striker rammed in the aggregate leveler. Caliguiri thought he had won it for the hosts in the extra period but a flukey goal from Nick Viergever put Ajax ahead again in a rollercoaster encounter and to add insult to injury for the home side, German Amin Younes added a second for the visitors right at the end. Schalke had been boosted before kickoff by news that Benedikt H\u00f6wedes and Arsenal transfer target Sead Kolasinac were fit to return in defence with right back Sascha Riether also returning to the starting line-up after a long absence. Indeed, the hosts started the game in confident mood with Max Meyer cutting inside and striking the post after just three minutes. Suddenly a memorable comeback looked on as Schalke dominated the opening 10 minutes, roared on by an expectant crowd. Suddenly the game changed But Ajax, who so comfortably overran the Germans last week, eased their way into the game and had a good half chance when Hakim Ziyech tested Ralf F\u00e4hrmann with a free kick. The Schalke goalkeeper was never likely to be as busy as he was in Amsterdam, where he saved his side from a more embarrassing deficit, but he was there when he needed to be as Ajax upped their threat. Schalke still carried their own though, and the lively Meyer blasted over when well-placed after a quick break. The home side just about edged the first half but it was the Dutchmen in fluorescent green who had the first big opportunities in the second period. Schalke were glad that faithful F\u00e4hrmann was on hand to beat away Lasse Sch\u00f6ne's flying set-piece and save Bertrand Traore's effort. Then suddenly the game changed. Burgstaller had endured a frustrating evening up to that point but had the vision to play a one-two with the charging Goretzka, who shot hard and low to make sure he scored despite a deflection. He later went off injured and was taken to hospital. Weinzierl then threw on veteran Klaas-Jan Huntelaar but the Dutchman, heavily linked with a return to former club Ajax in the post season, could only watch as strike partner Burgstaller bagged the second from a typically bustling Kolasinac cross. Ajax quickly looked a shadow of last week's side, with Joel Veltman sent off on 80 minutes for a second booking after a cynical foul on Nabil Bentaleb. The man advantage should have spurred Schalke on but they only mustered one very good chance from H\u00f6wedes in the final moments of the 90 minutes. Painful drama It looked like being the same story in extra time but Caliguiri popped up to expertly head home after 101 minutes despite the attention of two defenders, with Kolasinac again instrumental. The Veltins Arena has seen few nights like this in recent years but such is the side's inconsistency, the atmosphere actually went a little quiet as time wore on, fans petrified that Ajax would hit back with a crucial away goal. And that is exactly what happened. It would not be Schalke without more drama. Out of the blue, Viergever grabbed the goal Ajax needed and it was as scrappy as can be. The Ajax player miscontrolled a cross but as Matija Nastasic tried to clear, the ball cannoned off Viergever and into the net. Schalke desperately tried to hit back but gaps were inevitable and Younes completed the job. \"Compliments to the team for a good performance. It's an extremely bitter feeling to have gone out today. It is a bitter defeat as we were brutally unlucky,\u201d Weinzierl told Sky, referring to Ajax\u2019s first goal. \"Now we have to absorb the result. We deserved to qualify for the semifinals.\" It had looked like being a famous triumph for Weinzierl but now he faces the prospect of being the first Schalke boss since 2009 not to qualify for Europe next term. United through In the other ties, two more games went to extra time. Manchester United beat Anderlecht 2-1 on the night and 3-2 overall after Marcus Rashford\u2019s extra-time winner. But United lost Zlatan Ibrahimovic to a serious-looking knee injury. Lyon also went through to the semifinals after winning 7-6 on penalties after a 2-1 loss on the night at Besiktas.

"story": "Oxfam sex scandal: EU warns charities to uphold 'ethical standards' Following the Oxfam sex scandal, the EU says charities risk losing their funding if they do not meet ethical standards. Oxfam's deputy chief executive has resigned while taking \"full responsibility\" for the scandal. The European Union on Monday ordered British aid group Oxfam to explain its handling of a sexual misconduct scandal involving its staff paying prostitutes in Haiti after the devastating earthquake in 2010. It also warned its NGO partners that the bloc would cut funding if they breached ethical standards, underscoring its \"zero tolerance\" approach towards misconduct. \"We expect Oxfam to fully clarify the allegations with maximum transparency as a matter of urgency, and we're ready to review and, if needed, cease funding to any partner who is not living up to the required high ethical standards,\" spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic told reporters. Read more: Peacekeepers commonly barter goods for sex, says UN study Oxfam, which received \u20ac1.7 million ($2.1 million) in funding from the EU for work in Haiti in 2011, is being accused of covering up the episode and failing to warn other aid agencies about the employees involved, which allowed them to get jobs among vulnerable people in other disaster areas. Oxfam Deputy Chief Executive Penny Lawrence resigned from her position on Monday, taking \" full responsibility\" for the scandal. \"Over the last few days we have become aware that concerns were raised about the behavior of staff in Chad as well as Haiti that we failed to adequately act upon,\" Lawrence said in a statement. \"It is now clear that these allegations\u2014involving the use of prostitutes and which related to behavior of both the country director and members of his team in Chad\u2014were raised before he moved to Haiti,\" she added. Oxfam has denied accusations of a cover-up, saying it launched an internal investigation the moment it became aware of the allegations. The probe led to the sacking of four Oxfam employees, the charity said on Friday, adding that three people, including the country director, resigned before the end of the investigation. Read more: Haiti, the UN and the unintended effects of a peace mission British government threatens to cut funding British Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman told reporters that Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt was meeting Oxfam representatives on Monday. \"DFID (the Department for International Development) have taken action in this area to try and further strengthen systems to enforce a zero tolerance approach. There are a number of measures they have taken but we want to go further in this area,\" he said. DFID gave Oxfam nearly \u00a332 million (\u20ac36 million) last year. The British government has also threatened to cut off funding to Oxfam or any other aid agency that doesn't cooperate with the government's efforts to rein in misconduct. Oxfam, which has announced new measures to tackle sexual abuse cases, said it would share with authorities all the information it had relating to the scandal in Haiti. ap, law/kms (AFP, AFP)",

"story": "Lufthansa closes in on Austrian Airlines takeover More than 85 percent of Austrian Airlines shareholders have reportedly accepted a public takeover offer by Germany's Lufthansa. But rival airlines continue to object to the move as being unfair. Lufthansa has cleared an important hurdle in its bid to take over cash-strapped Austrian Airlines. Lufthansa holds well over the 75 percent of shares in the company, according to Austrian Airlines (AUA). Shares of AUA rose by more than 12 percent to 4.19 euros ($5.70) after Tuesday's announcement. Austrian Airlines said exact acceptance figures would be made public on Thursday. Lufthansa shares dropped 3 percent on the announcement before recovering to end the day down by one percent. At the end of last year, Lufthansa agreed to buy a 41.6-percent stake in AUA from the Austrian government for 366,000 euros. In exchange, Vienna agreed to assume 500 million euros of the struggling airline's debt. The European Commission opened an investigation after rival airlines complained about Austria's agreement with Lufthansa. The commission is scheduled to rule on the issue by June 17. Lufthansa is reportedly also interested in raising its stake in the British airline BMI to 80 percent this year.",

"story": "US and UK create huge new safe havens for marine life Extensive new marine protected areas are being established by nations around the world, particularly the United States and the United Kingdom. The announcements came at the Our Oceans conference in Washington, D.C. More than 20 countries including Lebanon, Cambodia, Malaysia and the Seychelles have announced 40 new marine protected areas and expansions of existing ones, during the two-day Our Oceans conference currently being held in Washington, D.C. Among them were the United States and the United Kingdom, which both announced extensive new MPAs today. US President Barack Obama addressed the conference, saying, \"The notion that the ocean I grew up with is not something that I can pass on to my kids and my grandkids is unacceptable. It's unimaginable.\u201d He added, \u201cthe investment that all of us together make here today is vital for our economy, it is vital for our foreign policy, it's vital for our national security, but it's also vital for our spirit. It's vital to who we are.\" Last month, Obama expanded the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument off the coast of Hawaii by more than 1,140,000 square kilometers, creating the world\u2019s largest marine protected area. Today, he designated the first marine national monument in the Atlantic Ocean. The Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument is an area of 12,700 square kilometers off the coast of New England. It encompasses underwater mountains and canyons and is intended to protect marine species, including endangered whales, sea turtles and deep-sea coral. Britain's pledge was even more impressive. At the conference, Sir Alan Duncan, the UK's Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, announced that Britain would be creating MPAs around four islands in its overseas territories in the Pacific and Atlantic, totaling almost 6.5 million square kilometers. The biggest of these MPAs surrounds Pitcairn Island, where the legendary mutineers of the Bounty once settled. In his speech, Duncan made light of the fact that at 840,000 square kilometers it will be smaller than the new record-holder in the U.S. \"Well, this was going to have been my big moment, because until last week the Pitcairn MPA would have been the largest in the world,\" he told the conference. \"But President Obama sort of rather blew that out of the water by announcing an even bigger MPA in Hawaii \u2013 trust the Yanks to indulge in a bit of one-upmanship over us poor Brits. But we\u2019re happy as our loss is the world\u2019s gain and we congratulate the United States.\"",

"story": "Opposition says Egypt's roadmap to democracy not good enough Egypt's military council has presented its roadmap: the referendum on the constitution is scheduled for March 19. The parliament and the president will be elected in the summer. But the opposition opposes the roadmap. Egypt has been governed by the military council since February 11. The army leadership has now presented its roadmap, which schedules the referendum on the proposed amendments of the constitution for March 19. The new parliament is to be elected in June, the presidential elections would be held some six weeks later. Long debate The military council met with representatives of the 'Alliance of the Revolutionary Youth' for an overnight debate which lasted eight hours. The alliance is made up of several action groups which had initiated the protests against the Mubarak regime. The activists are not satisfied with the proposed roadmap. The date for new elections which had initially been set to take place two months later, they said, was too early for the opposition to have established proper party programs and to have launched nationwide campaigns. The only groups with a program and a good network, they said, were the Mubarak supporters and the Muslim brotherhood. An Egyptian judge in charge of the panel to change the constitution agreed that it is a \"short period to build mature, widespread and ideologically well-rounded parties that have strong grassroots support.\" But judge Tariq al-Bishri also told Reuters that \"political parties, when given the freedom to form, will grow faster and more effectively than in times of political stagnation like what we were in before.\" Protests continue on Tahrir Square Still, the revolutionaries planned to continue their protests on Tahrir Square in central Cairo. Another point they were criticizing is the fact that the army asked eight legal experts to write up the new draft constitution. \"Nobody elected this committee (the Supreme Council of the Egyptian Army) to state these amendments,\" said a demonstrator. \"They say that these amendments will be voted on by the Egyptian people, but I don't trust the army.\" The demonstrator said the army was currently heavily involved in the Egyptian economy and that it was therefore doubtful that military commanders would give up their interests. \"The Egyptian army is not going to do what we need,\" he said. Some hundred activists therefore put up their tents on Tahrir Square again. Mobile traders were selling souvenirs from the revolution to tourists who were amazed at the peaceful atmosphere there. \"Everybody's talking on the streets, there are crowds everywhere. They have never been allowed to demonstrate before and now they're free,\" a tourist from New Zealand said. \"Everyone has smiles on their faces. There's a great atmosphere of festivity.\" Changes 'merely cosmetic' But the demonstrators were hardly celebrating. They are rather trying to get their voices heard and to maintain pressure. The proposed amendments of the constitution would open up competition for the post of president which Hosni Mubarak held for 30 years, limit office holders to two four-year presidential terms and ensure judicial monitoring of elections. The state of emergency can only be proclaimed to last longer than six days if parliament has given its approval. These paragraphs are included in the amendments, but reformist politician Mohamed ElBaradei said the changes are merely cosmetic. \"The constitution is deformed,\" he said. \"It doesn't comply with democratic norms, not even with the amendments.\" He said the job of changing the constitution needed to be given to the people's representatives. \"We are now dealing with judicial corrections, but a constitution has more than judicial aspects, it has political aspects, too.\" 'Punishing Mubarak is not enough' The military council has imposed a travel ban on former president Mubarak and his family, who are no longer allowed to leave the country. His wife Suzanne and his son Gamal had planned to leave abroad from Sharm El-Sheikh with the family jet last Saturday. Airport staff said they stopped them from leaving. Legal experts say Mubarak could be arrested in the near future. But the revolutionaries on Tahrir Square said they want to achieve more than mere punishment for a handful of scapegoats.

"story": "Amos Oz Receives German Literary Prize in Dusseldorf Israeli author Amos Oz was presented with a top German award for his political and literary work on Saturday, Dec. 13. Oz, 69, was honored by the city of Dusseldorf with the Heinrich Heine Prize on the 211st anniversary of the 19th century German poet's birth. The award, worth 50,000 euros ($66,000), has been presented every two years since 1972 to personalities who share Heine's values of tolerance, human rights and mutual understanding of peoples. The jury said it chose to honor Oz for his \"literary quality, political sensibility, his humanitarian engagement and his bold clarity and determination in trying to build bridges between Israelis and Palestinians.\" Oz, who was born in Jerusalem in 1939, is one of Israel's best-known authors and political voices. He is a co-founder of the Israeli peace movement and a prominent champion of Palestinian rights. In his acceptance speech, Oz said the Arab-Israeli conflict could only be resolved in the context of European values of tolerance, rationality and pragmatism. However, it \"is being kept alive by fanatics on both sides.\" Having fought in the Six-Day War and Yom Kippur War, Oz has said he does not regret his participation. But in his acceptance speech, he added that he has always drawn \"a very clear line between wars that deal with survival and wars that deal with interests.\" Last month, Oz joined other Israeli intellectuals and dovish politicians to establish a new political party that aims to unite the Israeli peace camp.

"story": "Social media and breaking news: Keep calm and don't retweet everything you see Tweets, Facebook Live and Periscope feeds can offer useful insights into breaking news events, but if they are not used carefully, they can turn already tense moments into downright panic. It was a Friday evening in Munich and many people were on their way home from work or shopping for the weekend. All of a sudden, smartphones started beeping with tweets and breaking news alerts. Friends whatsapped each other and very quickly a now frighteningly familiar situation became apparent: there was an attack underway in a major European city. This time it was at the Olympia shopping center in Munich. Just like a week ago in Nice, France, anyone on Twitter, Facebook, Periscope or other social media networks received instant updates, pictures and videos of what was happening on the ground at that very moment. It's become commonplace in our digital age to turn to social media for information of any kind - even more so when it comes to breaking news. That's because hardly a news event takes place without eyewitnesses recording developments and sharing them instantaneously across social platforms. Violent and shocking events such as the shooting in Munich or last week's terror attack in Nice are no exception. In fact it is exactly in such situations that social media shows its greatest strengths and weaknesses. Speed and eyewitness perspectives When it comes to speed, reach and mobility, social networks have an undisputed advantage over other media. Given an internet connection, users can easily upload photos and videos of what they experience in real-time, regardless of where they are. And these have the potential to be seen by millions far away from the original uploader. If used wisely, this eyewitness social media content can give the public good and useful details. During the course of Friday's attack in Munich, many social media users did exactly that. Those who were at or near the shopping center when the shooting broke out, posted content and provided details of the location and current situation. By doing so they informed others of what was going on and possibly helped people avoid dangerous situations. One of the very early photos taken in front of the shopping center is by Timm Kraeft. His tweet indicates in matter-of-fact terms the location and extent of the police blockade. Another example is the activation of catastrophe warning notices, which alert people to dangers in their area. When a user in a Munich taxi saw a warning flash up on the board computer she photographed and shared it, thereby alerting her followers to the escalating situation in the neighborhood of Stachus. The police and public offices also took to social media to inform people of developments, such as which areas to avoid or details about train cancellations. Munich police were particularly active on Twitter, posting updates in at least four languages, keeping its audience abreast of all that was happening. Direct assistance Beyond its informational value, content shared on Twitter and other platforms can provide direct assistance to victims or others in need. One trend that has sadly become all too familiar is the use of the hashtag #PortesOuvertes or \"open doors.\" This term first appeared after the Paris attacks in November 2015, when residents opened up their homes and offered a place to stay for those stranded in the city. Residents in Brussels and Nice made the same gesture and now the German equivalent #OffeneT\u00fcr is spreading across Twitter users in Munich. This gesture and other help initiatives from Munich natives, such as this one to donate blood or anything else needed by the victims, are typical of the unifying power social media can have during and after a tragic event. Think before retweeting But tweets and live video feeds have their limits and can at times be a veritable source of harm during breaking news events. Amid the chaos and with emotions running high, users may share indiscriminately, as images flood their feeds with scenes of death and bloodshed. Some have good intentions and are simply seeking to inform others about the dimensions of the news. Others may more cynically seek to boost the numbers on their profiles or attract attention by sharing shocking images. Whatever the case, in these moments, it has become a regrettable habit for social media users \u2013 on Twitter in particular \u2013 to spread unverified content from unreliable sources. Needless to say, only minutes after the news broke in Munich, this type of content was already abundant online. Publishing fake, manipulated or contextually wrong material is unhelpful for those seeking information, but it is also insidious. Rumors are wildfires that are difficult to put out and traditional news sources or official channels, such as police departments, subsequently struggle to communicate verified information to the public, as it gets lost under the flurry of false information. The Munich police Twitter account told followers in no uncertain terms that sharing photos and videos of gunfire on social media was not acceptable. The police department called on users to report such content and even offered an upload tool so users could send it directly to the police. Spreading these rumors across the social networks not only complicates the job of security officials, it can be very unsettling to those who may be near a scene of crime. As one Twitter user pointed out, \"The people in Munich also have internet and are scared crazy by your rumors. Just stop it.\" Spreading terror is what the terrorists want Even verified content should be shared with extreme caution. Publishing pictures or videos of a crime scene or, worse still, of a crime as it takes place, poses a particular problem: Terrorists seek publicity; it is in the very nature of their action. They want you to see what they are doing, they want images of it to be spread and watched so as to frighten people. Sharing such content amounts to giving these people and organizations publicity and thus playing into their hands. Christian Christensen, a professor for journalism and a specialist on social media at Stockholm University, tweeted a warning along these lines in the hours following the terror attack in Nice. If you spread violent images, he wrote, \"accept you are doing what the terrorists want.\" Out of respect for the victims After events in Paris, Brussels, Nice and now Munich, one of the first reflexes of authorities is to ask the public not to share these images, if only out of respect for the victims and their families. When the police in Nice began seeing graphic content shared on Twitter they told people: \"Out of respect for the victims and their families, do not take part in spreading pictures or videos of the crime scene.\" The Munich police tweeted an adamant appeal to people sharing images of the victims: Christian Christensen put it quite succinctly in his tweet after the attack in Nice: Don't undermine the police Another problem with sharing live footage from a crime scene or on-going police operation is that the perpetrators themselves may see this very content and thus learn details about an investigation, hindering the working of the authorities. In Munich, police repeatedly posted urgent message asking the public to refrain from sharing such content, even tweeting it in several languages. Violent breaking news events are a difficult time for all, but it is especially so for those directly affected and for law enforcement agents. If there is one thing social media users users can and should do during this time, it is simply to stop and think about what impact a retweet, a like or a share would have before helping it go viral.",

"story": "Mustafa Dzhemilev's battle for Crimea The former leader of the Crimean Tatar community, Mustafa Dzhemilev, is receiving the Polish government's first Solidarity Award. It comes 70 years after he successfully fought for the right to return to his homeland. A grey-haired man in a suit and tie is walking along a rural street, surrounded by bodyguards who make him seem small and helpless. He doesn't make it far. Dozens of police officers in combat gear with two military vehicles have blocked the streets. One of the officers says he can't continue. Meanwhile, on the other side of the blockade, thousands of mostly young men have come to receive the older gentleman. Some of them even break through the barricade and cry, \"Mustafa!\", but they can't help him. This scene played out on May 3 near the city of Armyansk, along the new border between Ukraine and the Crimean peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in March. The older man's name is Mustafa Dzhemilev. For decades, he was a leader of Crimea's Tatars, and on that particular day, he wanted to go home. Authorities in Crimea continue to deny him entry to this day. Honored in Warsaw It's against this background that Dzhemilev will receive the Polish government's first Solidarity Award, which grants the honoree one million euros ($1.36 million). The name of the prize derives from Poland's Solidarnosc (Solidarity) trade union, whose fight against the communist regime contributed to the first somewhat free elections and a change of power in Warsaw in 1989. Dzhemilev is being honored for his \"service to democracy and respect for the rights and freedoms of citizens in Ukraine, particularly with respect to the Tatars,\" the Polish government said of its decision. Forced resettlement For the 70-year-old, the denial of entry to Crimea is particularly bitter. For the first time in decades, Dzhemilev could not take part in a May 18 ceremony memorializing the forced relocation of Crimean Tatars. Now, he must once again fight for a home that he already won once. Mustafa Dzhemilev was born on November 13, 1943, in a Soviet village in Crimea that was then occupied by Nazi Germany. Around six months later, his family, along with more than 180,000 other Crimean Tatars, was deported to Central Asia. As a justification, the government in Moscow claimed the Crimean Tatars had collaborated with the Nazis. Dzhemilev's family was sent thousands of kilometers east of Crimea to the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, like most other Crimean Tatars. 15 years behind bars Even as a youth, Dzhemilev harbored a deep interest in the history of his people in Crimea. He founded a union for Crimean Tatar youth before he was even 20 years old - an organization that fought for Tatars to return to their homeland, which led the Soviet Union to ban it. Dzhemilev lost his job as a laborer in an aircraft factory, but was permitted to study at an agricultural institute. That also proved short-lived. In 1965, he was removed from school on formal grounds. One year later, in May 1966, Dzhemilev was convicted by a court for refusing military service. But he accused the Soviet security agency, the KGB, of wanting to punish him for his activism in support of Crimean Tatars' rights. Later, Dzhemilev was convicted five times and spent a total of around 15 years in prison. He was friends with famous Soviet dissidents, including the Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei Sakharov. Human rights activist Petro Grigorenko described Dzhemilev in a magazine as \"a person with an unbelievably strong will.\" In 1975, Dzhemilev embarked on a ten-month hunger strike and was force-fed. From dissident to politician During the perestroika period under Mikhail Gorbachev, Dzhemilev was released from jail. He returned with his family to Crimea in 1989 and was voted head of the traditional Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People, a group he led through 2013. He worked in favor of bringing back Crimean Tatars from Central Asia - a time full of tense conflicts. That's because houses in which Crimean Tatars once lived had been handed over to Russians during the Soviet era. Dzhemilev managed to de-escalate the tensions. In the 1990s, Dzhemilev got involved in politics and was elected to parliament in Kyiv in 1998 for the party Narodny Ruch Ukrainy (Ukrainian People's Movement). He remains a member of parliament today, although he is now without a party. During the Orange Revolution in 2004, Dzhemilev and the Crimean Tatars on the side of pro-Western presidential candidate Viktor Yushenko. Possible minister post? As pro-Russian sentiment grew stronger in Crimea at the end of February 2014, thousands of Tatars protested against a break-up of Ukraine. Shortly before the annexation of the peninsula, Russian President Vladimir Putin tried to win Dzhemilev over to his side. \"He apparently wanted us to maintain neutrality, although that word was never used,\" Dzhemilev said in a televised interview about his half-hour phone call with the head of the Kremlin. The approximately 300,000 Crimean Tatars did not take part in the March 16 referendum on Crimea joining Russia. They also opted not to engage in armed conflict against the vote. Today, Dzhemilev resides in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Petro Poroshenko, who was elected president on May 25, announced he would establish a ministry to deal with Crimean affairs. Dzhemilev is being discussed as a potential head of the institution.",

"story": "Why Kristalina Georgieva is the best choice for UN secretary-general Kristalina Georgieva has finally convinced her prime minister she stands the best chance to be UN secretary-general. Max Hofmann and Barbara Wesel think the EU Vice President from Bulgaria might be just the ticket. Because of her personality Having experienced her in official and unofficial situations both in meetings and conferences from Prague to Brussels, one thing becomes clear: What you see is what you get. Georgieva is authentic. She's always lively and outspoken, yet listens carefully to whomever speaks with her. At times she is funny, her quips in discussions are guaranteed to provoke giggles, even with the most serious of Eurocrats. She has been known to provoke laughter in budget negotiations. It's safe to say that she would add some new wrinkles to UN communication, including effortlessness and humor. But Georgieva is also hard working and tough as nails. People who work closely with her in Brussels describe her as relentless. All the people in her cabinet are younger than her but still have to work in shifts to keep up with her. She'll visit seven different time zones in two days and never miss a beat. Not a bad quality for a secretary-general. Because she's from Eastern Europe The obvious argument here is that the region never had a UN secretary-general. It's a valid one but not the only one. The region is connected to many of the problems not only Europe but the whole world is facing. Georgieva's home, Bulgaria, is on the front line of the refugee crisis, a neighbor to Turkey and a mere 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) away from Aleppo in Syria, the symbol of one of the most terrifying conflicts in the world. Bulgaria is also very close to Ukraine and Moldova, two countries locked in a frozen conflict with Russia. Georgieva brings the experience of having seen the Iron Curtain fall and the subsequent changes in Eastern Europe. She has the support of many countries in the region. And she might even be acceptable to Moscow: Georgieva lived there for two years during her time at the World Bank, she speaks good Russian and knows who is who. She has met with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and if they should really want an Eastern European in the job, she is the candidate with the best shot at uniting the geographical camps in the UN. Because she is a woman It's time for a woman at the top of the UN. A third of member states and numerous civil society groups have already pushed for the first woman secretary-general. There is a difference between a suit and a trouser suit. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is said to be one Georgieva's political sponsors. And the Bulgarian is a candidate who brings some of the most-needed qualities to the table: She has international and financial experience from her time at the World Bank. But she has remained practical, results-driven and shows little personal vanity, which distinguishes her from rather a lot of men in the field. At the same time the EU Commissioner is charming enough to foster compromise between opposing political factions and everybody still likes her afterwards. Apart from her ability to bring people together, her friends praise her noted short-windedness. Kristalina Georgieva begins most of her speeches with the remark: \"I have only three very short things to say\u2026\" And she even sometimes sticks to that. Because she will be a breath of fresh air Kristalina Georgieva knows international institutions, but she is not part of the UN machine, as opposed to her greatest rival Antonio Guterres, who was until recently the UNHCR High Commissioner for Refugees. She will certainly bring a fresh eye to the job. In the European Parliament Georgieva carries the nickname \"action-woman.\" She can talk to everybody: From representatives of the left to the euro-sceptic Conservatives, people will engage with her. She is decidedly unstuffy and likes pragmatic solutions. In her world, problems should be solved not along ideological divides but by what brings results. Debates about political theories and left or right don't interest her. At the same time Kristalina Georgieva confronts the political issues head on: \"What I see is an issue of human security today,\" she said in a recent interview. \"People are anxious everywhere. Today, our crises overlap. Even the young, educated, urban and wealthy are anxious.\" In the face of that analysis, the Bulgarian politician herself is a fearless person, which makes her particularly suited for the job of UN secretary-general. Because of this story In 2010, when Georgieva was EU Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid, she was on holiday when Pakistan got hit by heavy floods. Her staff recalls hesitating to contact her but ended up calling anyway. The Commissioner interrupted her vacation and flew to Pakistan via Brussels. The plane was scheduled to land around midnight but got delayed because of weather. Eventually Georgieva landed around six in the morning. People who were with her then remember how they were planning on delaying the whole program so she could get a couple of hours of sleep in the morning. She would have none of that. \"Sleep is a renewable energy,\" she is quoted as saying. \"We use the energy now and will renew later.\" Despite the delays, Kristalina Georgieva was one of the first to arrive in the area.

"story": "Nigeria declares state of emergency Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has announced a state of emergency in the country's northeast. He said the government would do everything to put an end to the terrorist attacks. Nigeria put its northeast states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa under a state of emergency amid an increase of terrorist activity from the Islamist insurgent group Boko Haram in recent weeks. \"These actions amount to a declaration of war and a deliberate attempt to undermine the authority of the Nigerian state and threaten [its] territorial integrity,\" said President Jonathan in a live broadcast Tuesday night. \"As a responsible government, we will not tolerate this.\" The president said the terrorist activities were a \"threat to [Nigeria's] national unity\" and a \"systematic effort\" to destabilize the country. Jonathan ordered troops to help stem the insurgency in the country's northeast where some towns have reportedly fallen under the control of Boko Haram. The state politicians will retain the powers of the offices they hold despite the military deployment to the region. Boko Haram, whose name means, \"Western education is sacrilege,\" in the Hausa language has been calling for shariah law to be imposed across Nigeria. Muslims comprise about half of Nigeria's population of 175 million. About 40 percent of its citizens are Christian. Since launching their insurgency against the central government in 2010, Boko Haram and splinter groups have staged numerous terrorist attacks on security forces and civilians, in which at least 1,600 people were killed. Late last week, 200 heavily armed gunmen staged a coordinated attack on a police station and prison in Borno state in a bid to free inmates. At least 55 people died in the siege. kms/msh (AP, AFP, Reuters, dpa)",

"story": "World leaders gather to honor Shimon Peres at Jerusalem funeral Dignitaries from around the globe have converged on Jerusalem for the funeral of Israel's former President Shimon Peres. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who signed a peace accord with Peres, was among the guests. Police closed roads in central Jerusalem ahead of the Friday funeral, as Peres' coffin made the journey from Israel's parliament, the Knesset, to the National Civil Cemetery at Mount Herzl. The ceremony was Israel's largest since that of Peres' former partner in peace negotiations Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, with some 3,000 set to attend. Israel's foreign ministry said 20 presidents and 15 foreign ministers were invited, with Germany represented by President Joachim Gauck. Among the attendees were US President Barack Obama and a Palestinian delegation including President Mahmoud Abbas. In a 20-minute eulogy, Obama said that Abbas' presence at the funeral was a reminder of the \"unfinished business of peace\" in the Middle East. The US president went on to praise Peres for always striving for a equal resolution of the Israeli-Palestian conflict. \"Even in the face of terrorist attacks, even after repeated disappointments at the negotiation table, he insisted that as human beings, Palestinians must be seen as equal in dignity to Jews and must therefore be equal in self-determination,\" Obama said. 'A great man of the world' Addressing the congregation, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also hailed his former political rival. \"Shimon lived a life of purpose,\" Netanyahu told world leaders and other mourners. \"He soared to incredible heights. He was a great man of Israel; he was a great man of the world. Israel grieves for him, the world grieves for him, but we find hope in his legacy, as does the world.\" While the two men had major differences in terms of policy, they enjoyed a strong personal relationship. \"I loved you,\" said Netanyahu. \"We all loved you. Farewell Shimon. Dear man. Great leader.\" Peres' casket had lain in state on Thursday, with thousands of people visiting to pay their respects. Former US President Clinton lauded Peres' optimism. \"His critics often claimed he was a naive, overly optimistic dreamer. They were only wrong about the naive part,\" said Clinton, who led the US administration during Middle East peace efforts in the 1990s. Mediation on hold Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have been frozen since 2014, with Netanyahu and Abbas deeply-divided over Jewish settlements in the West Bank, as well as other issues. The pair, who have not held face-to-face talks since 2010, shook hands at the ceremony, which Abbas said he wanted to attend as a mark of respect for Peres' commitment to peace. Peres - who was a joint Nobel Peace Prize winner after negotiating the Oslo peace accords with the Palestinians in the 1990s - died on Wednesday, aged 93. He had suffered a major stroke two weeks earlier. In a political career spanning seven decades, Peres filled nearly every position in Israeli public life. He was credited with steering the country through many of its most defining moments. Since the Oslo accords were agreed in 1993, the peace process went into decline and eventually collapsed entirely. ksb, rc/kl (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)",

"story": "Cologne public library redefines its role through new refugee project Is a library only a storehouse of books for visitors to borrow and read? Not for Cologne. The city library's mission is to facilitate networks of knowledge and information between residents and newcomers - the refugees. On a sunny day, Neumarkt, Cologne's popular commercial district, is abuzz with shoppers. Slightly off the main road, a quiet street lined with small restaurants and grocery shops leads to the city's public library - a solid concrete-and-glass structure. The words \"Zentralbibliothek\" at the entrance door announce the location. Past the entrance hall and reading areas, a big steel door leads to the library's offices, where diligent librarians stamp, classify and line up books to be taken back to their shelves. But the library is much more than endless rows of shelves filled with books for the word-hungry. \"A library is a consumerism-free space,\" says Hannelore Vogt, director of the Cologne Public Library. \"You can be here without having to consume anything. What I mean is, if you go anywhere in the city, to a cafe or if you want to meet anyone, you need to spend money. And people perceive a library as a place where you simply go to and that is what is important for us,\" she adds. The 'Sprachraum' as a meeting place This was the basic idea that gave birth to the \"Sprachraum\" - literally, the language room - at the library. The project began in 2015, shortly before Germany experienced a massive influx of refugees who arrived in Munich in September that year. \"We began receiving queries from people who wanted to know if we had space for organizing events, voluntary activities and for teaching German. Many of these were official requests, but we had several people who said they wanted to volunteer for such activities,\" Vogt said. Vogt and her employees then decided to open the \"Sprachraum\" in a separate building, a minute's walk away from the main library. The room was furnished with tables and chairs, books for learning German, a projector and whiteboards and a comfortable seating area with a couch and a coffee machine. Now, around 15 teams use the room in the morning for their courses and 55 volunteers come by in the afternoons to help migrants learn German or other subjects. \"Volunteers engage with refugees in different ways,\" says Carolin K\u00f6hnen, head of the literature section in the library. \"Many of them help in organizing events that take place in the Sprachraum,\" she adds, showing a brochure which announces events and meetings planned for the week. \"We also decided to organize game meetings on one Saturday every month, because we thought that even if there were problems speaking the language, people would still have fun playing.\" Other workshops in the Sprachraum include courses in writing for everyday communication and a conversation club that decides on a topic each week. \"Last week we discussed the concept of respect. We also compared holidays in Germany with those in the countries of origin of the migrants.\" According to K\u00f6hnen, many people attend the same events again and again, but others prefer to just sit and listen. Contrary to expectation, the Sprachraum's administrators have not faced any big problems until now. \"We never had a problem in the Sprachraum where we had to call the security or something similar,\" says Carolin K\u00f6hnen, adding that the biggest challenge has been to find enough tables and chairs when there were too many participants. Connecting old residents with newcomers Meanwhile, Cologne's newest residents are warm up to the idea of having a space to meet new people -other than their designated shelters. On a weekday afternoon, Abdullah, from the town of Afrin in Syria, has come down to the Sprachraum to get help with his language. He arrived in Germany five months ago and is trying to get a language certificate that will let him enrol in a professional course. After a few moments of hesitation, he agrees to chat. \"I am 35 years old and unmarried. I am a tailor by profession and my hobbies include music,\" he rattles off in short sentences in his newly-acquired German. \"The Sprachraum was a coincidence. I was out for a walk and saw a poster and came here last week,\" he says. Since his first visit, Abdullah has been regularly coming to the library to practise spoken and written German. \"I have met new people here and am happy. I am really satisfied,\" Abdullah says. Another refugee, El Mehdi from Algeria, is sitting at a table with a volunteer and struggling to make sense of German sentence structures - so different from his native languages, French and Arabic. El Mehdi came to know about the initiative from a friend and visited the place frequently. \"I came here a lot last month, but now I am not here very often because I have to go to work,\" he says during a break from his German lessons. El Mehdi's teacher for today, Charlotte Starke, is used to working with refugees. She is a German teacher by profession and comes to the Sprachraum once a week. \"I have worked with refugees before and am a language teacher. I am helping people here because I think it is a good thing to do,\" she says. The library has 55 volunteers who take turns to come and help migrants with German language lessons and participate in discussions with them. Starke and dozens of other volunteers have helped made Cologne library's Sprachraum a success and the project seems to be gathering more and more followers. For Director Hannelore Vogt, this is a prime example of how the library fulfils its role in the city. \"We as a library see our role in providing the space, the media and the infrastructure, and we get things rolling,\" she says. Ultimately, the library connects people with one another, but the actual task is carried out by Cologne's residents for their newer counterparts - the refugees who will inhabit the city, she adds.",

"story": "Germany: Fire breaks out near train tracks in Siegburg, injuring dozens Dozens of people were injured after a fire broke out near railroad tracks in the drought-hit town of Siegburg. Dry conditions helped the blaze spread quickly to nearby houses, with firefighters facing a \"wall of fire.\" Hundreds of firefighters battled for hours on Tuesday to contain a fire that broke out in the western German town of Siegburg, located near the city of Bonn. The fire started in a grassy area near a key railway route, quickly spreading to nearby houses and shutting down rail traffic for several hours. Dozens injured in blaze: At least 28 people were injured in the fire, three of whom were in a serious condition, according to local officials. Among the injured were 20 local residents, three firefighters and five police officers. Over 520 firefighters took part in the operation, with emergency crews using a police water cannon vehicle and a helicopter to control the blaze. Nine houses were severely damaged, with pictures showing some attics caved in. Crews faced 'a wall of fire' The fire broke out near the train tracks in Siegburg, quickly spreading up a bone-dry, grassy embankment towards nearby houses. \"The first responders were basically faced with a wall of fire,\" one fire department spokesperson told news agency dpa. Investigations into the cause of the fire are still ongoing. Local officials earlier said they suspected that sparks from a train traveling on the tracks may have started the blaze, but later emphasized that other factors could have caused the fire. Train traffic halted: A high-traffic train track runs through Siegburg, servicing a busy, high-speed ICE train line that runs from the city of Cologne to Frankfurt. German rail company Deutsche Bahn told travelers in a statement that delays on the Cologne-Frankfurt route could last into Wednesday. Fire aided by drought conditions: An ongoing heat wave and drought in Germany and other areas of Europe contributed to the spread of the massive fire. The heat has hit farmers particularly hard, with numerous crops damaged and poor harvests expected. Temperatures reached 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit) in Siegburg on Tuesday with the area seeing little to no rainfall in weeks. \"When it's 39 degrees, these things can spread quickly,\" a fire department spokesperson said. rs/aw (AFP, dpa)",

"story": "Dortmund, Schalke come away with wins in CL openers The group stage of the Champions League kicked off on Tuesday night, and both German sides - Borussia Dortmund and Schalke - came away with wins. After thirty minutes of evenly matched football, Schalke began to gain the upper hand on the road against Olympiacos Piraeus. Schalke thought they had gone ahead in the 37th minute when Kyriakos Papadopoulos sprung up in a direct challenge with Olympiacos keeper Balasz Megyeri and headed the ball in from five meters. The ref signaled for a goal, but the goal-line official said it was a foul. Just four minutes later, though, Schalke found themselves in the lead after all. Jefferson Farfan lined up to take a corner and sent a low drive just off the near post. Benedikt H\u00f6wedes, getting out in front of the defense, was there to meet the kick and direct it goalwards with his head. Schalke went into halftime with a 1-0 lead. First step in brutal group With a packed Signal Iduna Park in full song, Dortmund took the field against Ajax Amsterdam knowing that every point would count in their nightmare group, which also includes Real Madrid and Manchester City. Dortmund showed their typical up-tempo style of play, but unlike the Bundesliga, they were not able to simply run rings around their Dutch opponents. Both sides had a few good looks at the goal in the first half, but it was Ajax (with the help of Dortmund's keeper, Roman Weidenfeller) that caused several thousand Dortmund hearts to skip a beat in the 35th minute. Weidenfeller charged out of the goal to meet a solo attack from Ajax striker Derk Boerrigter. He prevented the goal, but then kept chasing the ball as it bounced further away from the goal. A few odd hops later, Ajax was in possession again with Weidenfeller nowhere near his station. Luckily, his defense was able to return the favor and cover for the keeper. After the break, Dortmund managed stretches where they were able to put consistent pressure on Ajax, but booted away several clear chances. Just three minutes in, Dortmund's striker Robert Lewandowksi caught half of Ajax's back line on the wrong foot but launched the ball far over the goal on the finish attempt. Shortly after, it was Mario G\u00f6tze with the ball on a solo run into the area. He was brought down by Ricardo van Rhijn, and the ref awarded a penalty. Mats Hummels lined up to take the kick for Dortmund, but his weak effort was easily held by Ajax keeper Kenneth Vermeer. Quick fix in furious three minutes Meanwhile, in Piraeus, the hosts equalized, Schalke came back ahead and then missed a decisive penalty that would have likely put the game out of reach - all within three minutes. In the 58th minute, Olympiacos striker Rafik Djebbour passed into the area to set up Djamel Abdoun from 10 meters out, who easily tunneled Schalke keeper Lars Unnerstall. Immediately after play restarted, Lewis Holtby found Klaas-Jan Huntelaar dead center in front of the goal at the penalty spot, who hammered the ball past Megyeri to put Schalke up 2-1. A minute after that, Kostas Manolas took down Tranquillo Barnetta, drawing a yellow card and a penalty for Schalke. Huntelaar took the kick, but his shot ricocheted off the post and dribbled out for a goal kick. The Royal Blues' lead held for the remaining thirty minutes of play, and Schalke picked up a win in their first group game. Better late than never Dortmund, on the other hand, continued to struggle to convert chances, with faulty footwork or a missed pass often costing them the chance rather than Ajax defenders. But in the 87th minute, coach J\u00fcrgen Klopp's men got the goal they had earned. Ilkay G\u00fcndogan whipped over a cross-field pass for Lukasz Piszczek, who headed in front of the goal to a waiting Lewandowski. Dortmund's Polish striker took a few patient touches to shake his defenders, and then put away the long-overdue goal to the delight of the home fans. \"That was a very, very nice goal,\" Klopp said after the match. \"That's the hallmark of a great striker.\" Ajax was unable to find an answer in the closing minutes of the game, and Dortmund will be glad down the road that they were able to pick up the extra two points in Group D. Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo saved a win for his side over visitors Manchester City in Tuesday night's other Group D game, scoring the winning goal in the 89th minute for a final score of 3-2 for Real.

"story": "Europa League finalist Dnipro among three clubs handed European ban Having defied all odds to reach the Europa League final last year, Ukrainian side Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk have now been banned from European competition over financial violations. Last year's Europa League finalist Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk of Ukraine has been named among three clubs banned from European competition by UEFA over financial issues. UEFA announced on Thursday that Dnipro, Azerbaijan's Inter Baku and Romania's Targu Mures would be excluded from the next European competition for which they qualify in the next three seasons. All three clubs had been ordered by UEFA to clear \"overdue payables\" and told they would be excluded from Europe unless they cleared those debts by January 31. \"I did not imagine this could have happened to the club that was playing in the Europa League final half a year ago,\" Dnipro head coach Myron Markevych, whose side knocked out Ajax and Napoli on route to the Europa League final last year, which they lost 3-2 to Sevilla, told the \u201cSegodnya\u201d newspaper. \"How could it happen? I am not aware of the president's plans and how he sees the future of the club. We've got new debts. I know the foreign players are making new complaints. We have not been paid for four months at all. \"This is very bad for us,\" Markevych added. \"We have been playing on the European stage for 10 years and now we have been kicked off for something which is not the fault of the players and coaches.\u201d UEFA gave no statement on another Romanian club, Astra Giurgiu, which had been given the same January 31 deadline.",

"story": "Russia votes: Vladimir Putin is counting on female turnout The Kremlin has put its faith in one particular group of voters for Russia's presidential election: women. Will a large turnout by female voters propel President Vladimir Putin to an overwhelming victory? For all intents and purposes, Russia's March 18 presidential election was decided long ago. The incumbent, Vladimir Putin, who is running for the fourth time, has a decisive lead in all the polls. But the Kremlin's unofficial goal of achieving a landslide victory \u2014 \"70 percent plus X\" \u2014 seems to be in jeopardy because of a possible low voter turnout. The renowned Levada Center opinion research institute estimates that only 52 to 54 percent of eligible voters will show up, which would be historically low. However, state-affiliated opinion pollsters are forecasting higher figures. Voter turnout in Russia has recently declined dramatically. It suffered a serious slump in the parliamentary elections in 2016 in the densely populated capital, Moscow, falling to about 35 percent. And now the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was banned from running in the presidential election, is calling for a boycott. Against this backdrop, the Kremlin is apparently now, among other things, counting on women: the largest and most influential voter group in Russia. Many observers have described Putin's election campaign as unusually colorless \u2014 apart from his unexpected presentation of new nuclear weapons during the state of the nation address in early March. The introduction of monthly child benefit payments is one of the few initiatives that has stood out in the campaign so far. Putin announced that measure in late November, a few days before declaring his candidacy. The new regulation, from which hundreds of thousands of families stand to benefit, came into force in January. That was perfectly timed for the start of the intense final phase of the election campaign. There are also other indications of the particularly important role of women in this election. The central election commission has produced a television advertisement especially targeting women. In a half-minute video, they are celebrated as \"gentle, yet strong,\" but also for their ability to \"unite and lead.\" The main message at the end is \"come and vote, and bring the whole family.\" There is no such message in a TV commercial that was produced for men. In other videos, that are in some instances anonymous and are mainly distributed via social media, to address younger audiences, women are presented as responsible leaders who are insisting on voting in the presidential election. In one of the most well-known commercials, a wife sets her alarm clock in the evening so as not to miss the chance to vote the following day. Her husband makes fun of her, but then has a nightmare and ends up going to vote as well. Most loyal electorate Statistics suggest what is behind this approach. At the beginning of 2017, there were around 10 million more women in Russia than men. Retired women make up one-third of the total population, and there are twice as many women in this age group as men. Older Russian women are regarded as highly disciplined when it comes to voting and they usually support Putin. According to a survey conducted in mid-February by the state opinion research institute WZIOM, about 76 percent of the women interviewed want to vote for Putin for president. Among men, Putin has almost 62 percent of the vote. For years, Putin has cultivated his image as an athletic, fit and potent man. As part of this, he has presented himself in pictures with a naked upper body. In the middle of the election campaign, the 65-year-old again proved himself to be media-savvy by appearing bare-chested while diving into ice-cold water on the Christian Orthodox holiday of Epiphany on January 19. Russian women would seem to have had an unbroken devotion to Putin. This has not even been affected by wars, for example, in Syria, or by legislation changes that have led to milder penalties for domestic violence. Even controversial statements seem to be without consequences. \"I'm not a woman, I don't have difficult days,\" Putin said in a documentary film by US director Oliver Stone. His allusion to female physiology caused a stir on social media last year. He did not want to offend anyone, the president said at the time, it was just \"the nature of things.\" An anomaly in this election is that this is the first time that Putin has run for president without a first lady. He and his wife, Lyudmila, to whom he was married for many years, split up five years ago. The divorce doesn't seem to have bothered his female support base. There has been speculation that he has a new partner, but nothing has been confirmed. Shortly before the start of the election campaign, Putin did not rule out the possibility of there being a female president of Russia. There has been criticism for years that the largest section of the population is underrepresented in Russian politics. In the lower house of the Russian parliament, the State Duma, the proportion of women is currently about 15 percent, slightly higher than in previous periods/ in the past. In early 2011, the women's rights movement Otlitschnizy (1A-Girl) was founded in Moscow. Some media have described the movement as pro-Kremlin. One of its stated objectives is for there to be a female Russian president in 2018. The initiative received support from, among others, Lyudmila Narusova, a Federal Council senator. Narusova is the widow of the former St Petersburg Mayor Anatoly Sobchak, who was Putin's mentor in the 1990s. Otlitschnitsy quickly disappeared from the headlines and appears to have become inactive. Butthe journalist Ksenia Sobchak \u2014 Narusova's daughter \u2014 is the only woman among eight presidential candidates in 2018. She doesn't have much of a chance, and her role in the election has been controversial. Some even suspect that one of the 36-year-old Sobchak's goals, like the Kremlin's, is to boost voter turnout.",

"story": "Brazil pushes environment projects to tackle crime and poverty Brazil is set to host the 2016 Olympic Games, and is investing heavily in infrastructure and security to makes its streets cleaner and safer. New environment programs too could help lift people out of poverty. Rio is gearing up for the future. It's won the bid to host the 2016 Olympics, and before that, the 20th FIFA World Cup is scheduled to take place in the summer of 2014 in Brazil. Posters celebrating these two historic events are everywhere, including at the scenic Guanabara Bay, where children play soccer on the beach next to groups of sunbathers. It's an idyllic scene, but one that doesn't tell the whole truth. There are two sides to Rio de Janeiro: behind the scenes of this popular tourist destination lie sprawling slums dominated by poverty and violence. That didn't stop the International Olympic Committee (IOC) from choosing Rio as the site of the 2016 Olympics \u2013 making it the first city in South America to host the Games. In its application, the Brazilian government laid out an extensive concept for the transformation of the city's infrastructure, set to cost $14 billion. As well as new sporting venues, the concept foresees new subway lines and extensions to the existing two airports and harbor. Winners and losers But 80 percent of the funds have been earmarked for Rio's more affluent neighborhoods. To Thomas Fatheuer from the German Heinrich Boell foundation, this makes the upcoming Olympics very much a mixed blessing. \u201cThe poorer neighborhoods are left empty-handed,\u201c he complains. \u201cIt would make more sense to spend the money on long-term projects that are not necessarily tied to the Olympics.\u201c That includes environmental programs. Although plans have been drawn up for the construction of new sewage treatment plants and the introduction of more efficient recycling facilities, there has been little follow-through, stresses Fatheuer. Green and socially responsible But Brazil does have an environmental agenda. In 2000, the government passed a law boosting energy efficiency, and electricity providers have long been required to invest 0.5 percent of their turnover in projects that promote energy-efficiency. Half of these projects are designed to benefit the country's poor, who tend to spend over 25 percent of their income on electricity that is outdated and therefore far from cost-efficient. Recent years have seen many residents of Rio's favelas given energy-saving lamps and new, cleaner refrigerators. According to the GTZ, the German Organization for Technical Cooperation, these consume half as much energy as old appliances. At the same time, they can be responsibly disposed of at new, environmentally-sound recycling plants. Not only do such programs help Rio's working class economize, they also represent an opportunity for many to improve their situation. The refrigerator exchange program is often used by the people who spend their days collecting garbage \u2013 the catadores, which is Portugese for 'human scavenger' or 'rubbish collector.' They used to collect old refrigerators in the favelas and dismantle them in order to recover and sell any valuable materials such as metals and plastics. Now, the government has managed to integrate these catadores in the new waste management system in a way that secures their livelihood and offers them a way out of illegality and crime. Mean streets Nonetheless, the streets of Rio are ruled by drug gangs, and clashes with police \u2013 known in Brazil to use routine violence themselves - are part of day-to-day life. Security officers have been on permanent patrol in some slum neighborhoods for the last couple of years. These Pol\u00edcia Pacificadora \u2013 or Peacemaker Police Units - have met with strong resistance from the gangs, but their presence is starting to show results, with crime rates beginning to fall. In the run-up to the Olympics, Rio de Janeiro's authorities are planning to introduce these units in one hundred favelas. But this plan laid out by mayor Eduardo Paes has its detractors. According to Thomas Fatheuer, the only reason why the drug trade has fallen off in the patrolled neighborhoods is because the gangs have been squeezed out into other neighborhoods. All that's happened is that the problem has been relocated, he argues. But the government is undeterred. \"It's time to light the Olympic flame in a tropical country \u2013 and in the beautiful, wonderful city of Rio de Janeiro,\" rhapsodized then President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva at the IOC conference in Copenhagen in 2009. But until Rio cleans up its act \u2013 both socially and environmentally \u2013 its charm remains out of reach to much of its own population.

In the first episode, \u201cThe Attack,\u201d is about Thierry, a young French schoolboy whose initial patriotic enthusiasm for the war quickly wanes during the Battle of the Ardennes. Meanwhile, \u201cThe Escape\u201d tells the story of twelve-year-old Justine from Flanders in Belgium, who is confronted by the arbitrariness and injustice of wartime on the most bitter terms. Indiscriminate violence against civilians reached a new peak during the First World War, giving terms such as \u201cwar crimes\u201d or \u201cgenocide\u201d a whole new meaning. Part Two starts with \u201cThe Pain,\u201d the story of Frieda, a German girl who looks after wounded soldiers in hospital and discovers they are only being treated so that they can continue to fight, not to be healed. Then in \u201cThe Lie,\u201d we meet eleven-year-old Alison from Scotland, who learns that the war in the mind is as important as the war on the battlefield. Since the First World War, governments all over the world have been using propaganda to deceive their citizens and convince them of the necessity of unpopular measures. In Part Three, \u201cThe Mountain\u201dtells the story of the 10-year-old shepherd Tobias in South Tyrol, who is confronted with the \u201canonymity\u201d ofmodern warfare with its new weapons such as flamethrowers and poison gas. And in \u201cThe Odyssey,\u201d we meet another ten-year old, Jessica from America, who discovers a blind stowaway aboard a cargo ship and secretly supplies him with food. When he\u2019s discovered, Jessica's family must decide whether to stay out of the conflict or take a stand. In Part Four, \u201cThe Revolution\u201d tells the story of nine-year-old Misya from Russia, who loses his parents in the war and learns in his struggle to survive how important social order really is. Meanwhile, \u201cThe Punishment\" is about little Emilie from France, who projects her pain over the loss of her father onto \u201can enemy,\u201d a German prisoner of war. The same ideology later also characterized the Treaty of Versailles as the victors took revenge on the vanquished and so only sowed the seeds of further conflict and war.

"story": "Readers: Friendly Germans Are the Best Thing About Germany Readers shared thoughts and experiences about their favorite traveling spots in Germany and came to conclusions that a big part of their admiration for the country is due to the friendliness of German people. The following comments reflect the views of DW-WORLD.DE readers. Not all reader comments have been published. DW-WORLD.DE reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content. Three of my daughters and one son and his girlfriend and I spent an enjoyable vacation in Germany and enjoyed the beauty of driving the roads less traveled. Germany has so much to offer that we were not able to see because of a lack of time. The people are so friendly. -- James Morlock and family, US I hope the word doesn't get out about how great the Hartz Mountains and Saxony Anhalt are. All of the former \"East Zone\" is really great. We travel about every other year to Germany and love it. Great food and great people! -- Gerald Decker, US The best treasure in Germany is the people. To me, Germans are friendly, well informed, caring, polite, respectful, generous, and lovely. I feel at home in Germany. In my younger years, I even enjoyed compliments from respectful gentlemen while walking in the street. -- Lily Weidlich, US I am planning to return to Berlin and Dresden in the spring of 2008. I was greatly impressed with the friendliness of the people, the great art and music and how easy it was to travel by train and tram! German food is fresh and unspoiled by chemicals, excess salt and sugar, and is nourishing. My country could learn a lot from the German people. -- Samuel R. Ganczaruk, US Most Germans have a sarcastic smile when I tell them I love to visit Ostfriesland. They would change their mind if they went there and saw the peaceful beauty of the dykes embellished with sheep, horses and cows. They would be impressed by the ominous beauty of the North Sea -- the grey, tender and violent sea. They would fall in love with Greetsiel and Ditzum and their fisher boats. Leer is far from being empty, what a beautiful old city it is, and Emden, with its museum and river. The Dollart region is magnificent, and Helgoland proves nature is the best artist! All these places I mentioned are populated by the nicest people -- welcoming, making huge efforts to communicate with you, helpful, and always smiling. So before they crack another joke at Ostfriesland, or about its wonderful inhabitants, let them go take a look, they'll be hooked! -- Liliane Chaglassian, US I love Germany and I come back year after year. The people are great and the places are very clean and tidy. The only problem is that when I come, I want to stay. -- Paul, Great Britain Having traveled and visited there some 12 or 13 times year after year, I can honestly say that Germany offers my family more for the tourist or traveler than any other country in Europe. From visits to Bremerhaven and Cologne in the north to Garmisch-Partenkirchen in the Alpine region, we finally agreed to vacation each year in the same inn in the small village of Grainau, near the base of the Zugspitze. We now have many German friends there. -- Mack Trent, US",

"story": "Merkel criticized as danger to German democracy It's the strongest criticism of Angla Merkel's grip on power so far: A member of her own conservative party has published a book, describing Merkel as a danger to democracy in Germany. \"The Godmother\" is a book that Chancellor Angela Merkel probably won't read. Rumors are circulating that the Chancellor indignantly put aside an excerpt published in the German newspaper \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\" after reading just a few lines. Nevertheless, the 300-page \"anti-Merkel\" book penned by the 71-year-old-publicist, Gertrud H\u00f6hler, a confidante of former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, has the makings of a bestseller in political Berlin. More than 80 journalists and camera teams crowded into the federal press conference on Thursday. H\u00f6hler's book is about more than the tired old allegations that Merkel, for instance, pushes all male rivals out of her way, has not internalized any values and makes decisions only when she knows which way the scale will tip. Merkel, nicknamed \"Mutti\" or mommy in political circles, becomes a \"godmother\" in H\u00f6hler's book. She establishes a \"silent variant of authoritarian power that Germany has yet to experience.\" The author lists a number of attributes, such as stealing ideas from political rivals, leveling the party system to an all-party-state and sloppily handling legal norms, ethical standards, parliament and the constitution \u2013 and often reprimanded by the Federal Constitutional Court. In short, she points to a decline of political morals. \"German-tailored suit\" for Europe Perhaps all of this is linked to the 35 years that Angela Merkel lived under a dictatorial regime in East Germany. No one knows for sure what drives Merkel, who learned in the GDR to read between the lines, act silently, never say too much and be suspicious, H\u00f6hler noted when introducing her book. \"How Angela Merkel is rebuilding Germany\" is the subtitle of \"The Godmother.\" In H\u00f6hler's view, other Europeans should be concerned about Merkel's thirst for power as the Chancellor is giving Europe a \"German-tailored suit.\" The facts that the author has compiled on a creeping loss of democracy in Germany and Europe aren't new. What is new at first glance is the exaggerated role attributed to Merkel in this process. This reveals how much some conservatives in the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) are challenged by Merkel's claim to power and how her \"values of abstinence, coolness and dispassion have forced them into a corner,\" H\u00f6hler said. The sudden change of direction in energy policy that Merkel pushed through practically over night, the end of military service, the plans to lower taxes and abandon traditional views on the family by granting more rights to homosexual couples \u2013 these are all examples that have led to insecurity across the party. \"Godmother\" author Gertrud H\u00f6hler, long a member of the CDU, also worked as an adviser to Helmut Kohl. Biting their tongue H\u00f6hler's book has a dedication \"to all who are still biting their tongue.\" How many of these there are in the party is not clear. The CDU, for a long time, has had the reputation of being overly submissive to their chancellor when they're in government and it is Merkel's popularity that the CDU will have to thank if it manages to remain in power past the 2013 election. Toppling the chancellor from within the party is therefore very unlikely. Whoever wants a career in the CDU avoids crossing Merkel. Only old party veterans no longer seeking new positions dare to speak out. One of them is 72-year old Josef Schlarmann, head of the party's committee on small and medium-sized companies. He recently criticized that the party was merely taking orders. Attempts to go against Merkel's course have so far failed. The most recent case was when the so-called Berlin circle of some 35 CDU politicians announced a \"conservative manifesto\" to criticize what it perceived as the CDU taking over too many of the center-left's policies on social issues. The politicians said that they'd been encouraged to do so by thousands of letters from party members and other citizens. But the launch of the manifesto, planned for this Friday, has been cancelled on short notice, with a new date announced for autumn. Angela Merkel \u2013 who has just been named the world's most powerful woman again \u2013 is most likely not all too worried about it.",

"story": "Opinion: Gauck, the 'people's president' Joachim Gauck, Germany's newly inaugurated president, is a firm believer in the freedom of the individual and the duty of accepting responsibility. This is a promising start to a presidency, writes DW's Marcel F\u00fcrstenau. \"What should our country look like? This country, which one day our children and grandchildren will call 'theirs'?\" Joachim Gauck began his first speech to the nation with a question for which there will and can never be an answer. The worlds that have come to being in Germany and other places have become too complex and multifarious to be solved with any simple recipe. In his speech Gauck listed off a litany of concepts that, to be true, could easily lead to confusion: Separation, globalization, minorities, Europe, Middle East, fanaticism. The new president said he's aware of how perplexing this world can be and at the same time offered hope that he would work to establish a sense of orientation while in office. Gauck expressed his understanding for the disheartened and downtrodden - those overwhelmed by social, ethnic, religious and political tensions - and insisted that his first speech was meant for all Germans both \"in the country and abroad.\" These words come across as neither ceremonial nor stilted: Gauck, a former Lutheran pastor, is out to reach people with his words and win them over for his ideal of freedom, responsibility and trust. Gauck demonstrated with his first speech in office that he is capable of achieving this. Remembrance as 'source of strength' The 72-year-old said he wanted to combat the fear of the present and future with the means of remembrance, something he described as a \"source of strength.\" He is able to reconcile the differing social systems - still present in Germany over 20 years after being reunified - and put a positive spin on those separations that still exist. He said he was more impressed by the \"miracle of democracy\" in Germany than the \"economic miracle\" that made West Germany famous in the years after World War II. Gauck's acknowledgment and praise of the 1968 social liberation movement were widely applauded by the members of the German parliament present for Gauck's speech. This applause, which came from all factions of parliament and was anything but mere polite clapping, is a testament to Gauck's ability to integrate. He was even able to garner support from the Left Party - who initially went against his nomination - after praising the peaceful revolution that brought down the Berlin Wall and the German Democratic Republic in 1989 and 1990, respectively. Past, present and future \"We are the people,\" the motto of that revolution in the former East Germany (where Gauck grew up), is as relevant today as it was back then, he said. \"Two decades later this means - more than ever - that freedom is the necessary condition of justice and trust in democracy.\"Gauck's mission statement, one he wants to function as a kind of anchor, is that the differing people in Germany should strive to establish a common society. And that not only from the German perspective, but also - and equally - from the European perspective, one encompassing the views of Jews, Christians and Muslims alike. That Gauck took this opportunity to praise the services of his predecessor Christian Wulff, was appropriate and respectful. It was a gesture that could be appreciated by the millions of people living in Germany who are immigrants or whose parents come from other countries. Gauck asked these people in particular to have faith in their new president, faith in the politicians of Germany, and faith in themselves. Based on the impressions of his first speech, one can conclude that the new federal president will do everything to be perceived as one thing: a president of the people.

"story": "German Gymnastics Team Gets Boost from 33-Year-Old Medalist At her fifth Olympic Games in Beijing, 33-year-old gymnast Oksana Chusovitina finally claimed an individual medal. It's her story of determination and heartache that has won the hearts of viewers around the world. Oksana Chusovitina is one of a kind. Not only is she the oldest woman in over half a century to win an Olympic medal in gymnastics, she's been competing for nearly two decades already -- that's longer than many of her teammates have been alive. And she's competed in five Olympic Games under three flags. In 1992, just after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, she joined the unified ex-Soviet squad and in 1996, 2000 and 2004 she competed for her home country Uzbekistan, where she had already become something of a national hero. But this year, after claiming German citizenship in 2006, she is a member of the German team. Germany has traditionally not been shown particular strength in gymnastics and Chusovitina's silver on Sunday in vault was Germany's first Olympic medal in gymnastics in 20 years -- a much needed boost to the team. Son's illness shaped gymnast's path Chusovitina began her Olympic career in 1992 with a team gold in Barcelona. Besides coming up dry after that in Atlanta, Sydney and Athens, the 16-year quest for an individual medal was a rough one for the Uzbek athlete. In 2002, Chusovitina's son Alisher, then three years old, was diagnosed with leukemia. Since she already had close ties to the gymnastics team in Cologne, where she had competed in the German national league, she moved to Germany with her husband Bakhodir Kurpanov, a former successful wrestler, and their son. In Cologne, Chusovitina was able to train with the German team and seek medical attention for Alisher. She competed like mad in the years that followed, using her prize money to cover medical bills. Claiming German citizenship in 2006 allowed the gymnast and her family to stay in Germany for Alisher's follow-up examinations -- and it allowed her to strive for a fifth Games. Chusovitina hadn't abandoned her hopes for an individual. Ready for London in 2012 And Sunday's silver shows that, in a sport dominated by teenage prodigies, she has only improved with age. \"I don't feel 33, I feel 18,\" said Chusovitina. \"This medal is for my son. I can't say how happy I am.\" And she's not thinking about retirement. Instead, she's got the 2012 London Games on her mind. \"By then I'll be 37; if I can I'll do a sixth Olympics,\" she said.",

"story": "Scientists harvest Antarctic greenhouse vegetables German scientists have harvested their first vegetables to be\u00a0grown without earth or daylight in Antarctica. The greenhouse is a test run for growing plants in space and combating vegetable shortages in harsh climates. Cucumbers, radishes and lettuce are just some of the green delights that have been thriving in the experimental EDEN-ISS greenhouse in Antarctica. The project follows in the footsteps of successful US operations cultivating crops in the harsh climate. Despite temperatures in Antarctica falling below -20 degrees Celsius (-4 F) and the sun barely coming above the horizon, the first harvest from the project led by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) demonstrates how astronauts on the moon and Mars could be supplied with fresh food in the future. Read more: Our Beautiful Planet: Antarctica After the first three weeks, DLR engineer and Antarctic gardener Paul Zabel had gathered 3.6 kilograms (7.9 pounds) of lettuce, 70 radishes and 18 cucumbers. He spends about three to four hours a day tending to the Antarctic garden. \"After sowing the seeds in mid-February, I had to deal with some unexpected problems, such as minor system failures and the strongest storm in more than a year,\" Zabel said. \"Fortunately, all these things could be fixed and overcome.\" Read more: Antarctica is melting from below and that's bad news \"We have learned a lot about self-sufficient plant breeding in the last few weeks, it has become clear that Antarctica is an ideal test field for our research,\" said project manager Daniel Schubert. So far, all of the planned plants have grown successfully in the greenhouse, including radishes, salad leaves, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and herbs including basil, parsley, chives and coriander. But, Schubert said, \"You have to be patient when growing strawberries. Here we are still waiting for successful sowing.\" Read more: Gardening in the city The project is being carried out with the Alfred Wegener Institute and the greenhouse is located about 400 meters (1300 feet) from the institute's Neumeyer Station III. 'Fresh from the garden' There are currently 10 people toughing out the winter at Neumeyer Station III and the Antarctic harvest came just in time \u2014 the fresh vegetables from the last delivery at the end of February had been used up. \"It was something special to see the first fresh salad from Antarctica,\" said station manager Bernhard Gropp. \"It tasted as if we had harvested it fresh from the garden.\" Editor's note (06.04.2018): The original version of this article incorrectly stated that this crop of vegetables was the first to be harvested in Antarctica. That is not the case, it was merely the first harvest for this particular German Aerospace Center project. The McMurdo Station and Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station have both successfully run hydroponic greenhouse operations, with the McMurdo Station starting in the 1980s. We apologize for the error.

"story": "EU firms worried about China's tough business environment, trade tensions China is \"one of the most restrictive economies in the world,\" concluded a recent survey by the EU Chamber of Commerce in China. The chamber's president tells DW about European firms' challenges in doing business there. DW: What kind of difficulties are European firms, particularly the small and medium enterprises (SMEs), facing while doing business in China? Mats Harborn: European firms face a number of challenges in a variety of areas. The Chinese economic slowdown tops the list, but regulatory issues present greater challenges than competition from Chinese firms. This is especially striking considering how competitive they are becoming. Regulatory issues range from ambiguous rules to discretionary enforcement of policy to specific problems like access to licenses and financing or equal access to public procurement bids. All of these challenges are especially acute for SMEs, as they lack the resources and manpower to navigate these problems as easily as their larger counterparts. Read more: Donald Trump's EU trade dilemma: United against China or alone against the world? How do you assess the chances for the European Union and China to conclude their Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI)? The 17th, and most recent, round of negotiations on the CAI took place in Beijing from May 22-24, 2018. It is expected that intense work will continue through the rest of the year. The European Chamber is looking forward to seeing a well-negotiated agreement that addresses market concerns in all sectors and creates a more transparent and stable regulatory business environment. We would also like to see the implementation of robust and transparent investment protection and investment dispute resolution mechanisms as part of the CAI. The pressure is on with China now facing tensions with some of its key trading partners. The ball is in China's court and it is imperative that the government show that it is moving towards a decisive stage of negotiations before the end of 2018. Doing so would send a clear signal that China is ready to deliver on its promises on market opening. If there are continued delays, however, it will have negative effects on both China and the EU. In your report, you said that many Chinese firms are already equally or more innovative compared to European enterprises, due to a number of factors like increased R&D spending and targeted high-tech acquisitions by domestic companies. Can this trend bring disruption to European business? The results of the European Chamber's Business Confidence Survey 2018 show that for the first time ever, a majority of European companies feel that Chinese firms are equally or more innovative than themselves. This finding may be disruptive to European businesses but overcoming disruptions in a competitive market is nothing new for them. The most concerning source of disruption for our members is that of China's unpredictable regulatory environment and unequal treatment of European firms. The survey results also signify that it is time for China to lift protectionist measures. Chinese enterprises have proven that they can compete without the government protection in both domestic and international markets. Exposing Chinese firms to fair and open competition is the only way to help them develop further. How is China's rising middle class affecting the Asian nation's economic competitiveness? As more households join the middle class, they are demanding more high-quality products and services. Chinese enterprises are stepping up to meet this new demand, and in the process are giving foreign companies a lot more to think about. The Business Confidence Survey 2018 showed a notable increase in domestic firms' capacity for product and service innovation. In the past, Chinese companies have primarily embraced go-to-market and business model innovation, adapting existing products or models into new forms and finding new ways to deliver them to the domestic market. Now, however, they are starting to produce innovations that are the first of their kind. We can see clear instances of this in areas such as financial technology and bike-sharing. This said, European companies remain confident in their ability to compete, and their optimism about future growth has continued to rebound since 2016. What measures, in your view, should Beijing take to ease the regulatory burdens on European firms in China? The most common regulatory challenges for European companies in China are ambiguous rules and regulations, administrative issues and discretionary enforcement. Licensing requirements, customs procedures and discrimination in public procurement are also major issues. While foreign businesses suffer the most from these challenges, they are also an impediment to domestic Chinese companies, and in the long run, hold China back from meeting its development goals. There must be transparency and predictability when introducing new policies or regulations. Administrative burdens should be minimized, and rules and regulations should be applied evenly to all businesses. Additionally, sound regulations must be built on robust institutions. If China fails to develop these there is a risk that it will get stuck in the middle income trap. Finally, the biggest single step that China could take is to remove the legal distinction of \"foreign-invested enterprise\" and have international businesses register under uniform conditions with their local competitors. Fully realizing national treatment would put an end to unequal treatment for foreign firms and allow them to operate on a level-playing field. Read more: Donald Trump's trade spats with Europe, China and NAFTA \u2015 What you need to know Germany and China \u2014 trade partners and competitors What can be done by European governments to persuade Chinese authorities to ensure a level-playing field for their companies in China? China has made repeated commitments on equal treatment for all businesses since its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, but international firms are still legally required to register as foreign-invested enterprises, which differentiates them from domestic Chinese companies. There are multiple instances of unequal treatment, including regulatory enforcement, access to financing and forced technology transfers. In the Business Confidence Survey 2018, 19 percent of respondents report that they felt compelled to transfer technology in order to maintain market access. The European Union launched legal proceedings in the WTO against Chinese legislation on this issue on the June 1, 2018. The European Chamber supports the resolution of these concerns through the WTO framework. It is now urgent for China to deliver on its promises by realizing national treatment for all companies operating in China. This would not only show that China is committed to upholding its WTO obligations, but would also provide international companies with the operating conditions they need to provide the products and services that Chinese consumers demand. US President Donald Trump's administration and China appear to be heading toward a showdown on trade, with growing fears worldwide about its ramifications. How do you see this \"trade war\" affecting European companies and jobs? Many of the European Chamber's member companies are concerned about the trade tensions between the US and China. Raising tariffs means disrupting the global supply chains that our members have built up. There is also the risk that this could bring an end to the present boom in the economic cycle. We must remember, however, that the root of the problem began in China. It is imperative that China starts fulfilling the reform promises it has repeated since President Xi Jinping's speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2017. The European Chamber believes in engaging with China and creating a common narrative to support further market opening and reform and delivering equal treatment for all businesses.

"story": "Tanzania's Magufuli leads fight against corruption As an anti-corruption conference ends in London, in Tanzania the battle to end graft is on in earnest. At the forefront is President John Magufuli. In his five months in office, he's already shown he means business. Nicknamed \"the bulldozer\" for his style of leadership, Tanzania's President John Pombe Magufuli has earned himself credibility and acclaim, both in and outside Tanzania, for his fight against corruption. He has started to sweep away the country's reputation for endemic corruption and poor public service. The East African country is ranked among the top 20 countries in Africa with the worst corruption and is also placed 117th out of 168 countries in Transparency International's 2015 Corruption Index. Since assuming office in November 2015, Magufuli has been rebuilding lost trust with Western donors by firing public officials deemed to be incompetent and corrupt. Last November and December, six senior officials in the Tanzania Revenue Authority, including Commissioner General Rashid Bade, were fired. Also suspended was the director general of the Tanzania Ports Authority, Ephraim Mgawe, over a scandal involving the non-payment of $40 million (35,1 million euros) in import taxes. Magufuli also sacked Edward Hoseah, the long-serving director general of the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB), due to the slow pace of the fight against graft. Magufuli left no doubt about his aims immediately after he was sworn in. \"I'm telling government officers who are lazy and negligent to be prepared. They were tolerated for a long time. This is the end,\" Magufuli warned in his first speech as president. Later, he matched his words with actions, slashing the number of cabinet posts from 30 to 19 by merging ministries. \"The bulldozer\" banned inessential foreign travel for politicians and business class flights for all but the most senior figures. The president went further to ban the Independence Day celebrations in favor of leading a street cleaning campaign. Last month, Magufuli made his first foreign visit to Rwanda. While there, he said he had turned down many invitations from the West to attend various conferences. He drove all the way to Rwanda, avoiding flight costs. In Rwanda, the country's president, Paul Kagame, commended Magufuli's efforts in cutting unnecessary costs and fighting corruption in Tanzania. \"Your consistent message on fighting corruption is very refreshing. You have a good and reliable partner in Rwanda,\u201d Kagame told Magufuli. How Magufuli is making a difference The African Union estimates that $50 billion is lost to corruption and other financial crimes across Africa each year. Many heads of state on the continent have vowed to eradicate corruption from their countries. Legislation to punish the vice has been drafted and anti-corruption authorities have been formed. However, on the ground, little seems to have changed. Rwandan researcher and political commentator Christophe Kayumba told DW that, unlike other African heads of state, Magufuli has translated his intentions into actions. \"Magufuli has actually acted on his words. He has suspended corrupt officials and reduced public expenditure,\" Kayumba said. According to a local newspaper, Tanzania Daily News, besides cutting costs and taking administrative action against incompetent and corrupt public servants, some 596 cases related to corruption are currently before the courts. Many Tanzanians say they believe in Magufuli. However, some fear their president is fighting a lone battle. \"He is doing a good job, but the corrupt people don't appreciate that,\" Lightness Elly, a resident in Arusha, said. Another resident, Msafiri Musa, told DW that the president is fighting against top officials, influential leaders and wealthy people who have been surviving on graft. \"He is really trying, and that is why those who are used to taking bribes are opposed to him. We must back him in this struggle,\" Musa said. Also in Arusha, Mary Mahu said all corrupt activities should be exposed. \"There are some unscrupulous business people who have hidden a huge consignment of sugar and are now selling it at exorbitant prices,\" Mahu said. \"This is affecting us if the corruption networks are not dismantled.\" It is too early to say whether Magufuli will stick to his course as he continues in his first term in office. However, Kayumba is optimistic the president will keep up the fierce fight against corruption. \"If you study the history of President Magufuli, he comes from the old school of people who believe in integrity and moral values. He is a disciplinarian person,\" Kayumba said.",

"story": "New clashes erupt between Armenia, Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh Clashes between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces have killed at least 13 people in a third day of fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh. Turkey is backing Baku as the worst violence in decades hits the disputed territory. US Secretary of State John Kerry spoke to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Monday to review efforts to stop the violence that has broken out along the Nagorno-Karabakh line of conflict and how to get Armenia and Azerbaijan to resume talks. Russia and the West have scrambled to call for an end to the fighting. But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - a staunch ally of Azerbaijan - insisted that the Armenian-controlled region was rightfully part of Azerbaijan. \"Karabakh will one day return to its original owner. It will be Azerbaijan's,\" Erdogan said in televised remarks. Separatist authorities in Karabakh - which claim independence but are supported by Armenia - said three civilians and two more soldiers were killed in fierce shelling. And Azerbaijan said three of its troops were killed overnight when Armenian forces shelled its positions using mortars and grenade launchers. This comes as Armenia warns of a wider war against its neighbor. \"A further escalation of military actions could lead to unpredictable and irreversible effects, up to a widespread war,\" Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan said at a meeting with an envoy of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Interfax news agency reported. \"This will naturally affect the security and stability of not only the South Caucasus but also Europe,\" Sargsyan was quoted as saying. In an apparent reference to Erdogan's bullish statements, the Russian foreign ministry said: \"Lavrov and Kerry condemned attempts by certain external players to instigate confrontation around Karabakh.\" Decades of conflict in region Ethnic Armenian separatists backed by Armenia seized control of mountainous Nagorno-Karabakh - a majority ethnic Armenian region - during the twilight days of the Soviet Union. The foes have never signed a peace deal despite the 1994 ceasefire and some 30,000 people have lost their lives in the conflict. Energy-rich Azerbaijan, whose military spending exceeds Armenia's entire state budget, has repeatedly threatened to take back the breakaway region by force. jar/bw (AFP, Reuters, dpa)",

"story": "On centennial of Tolstoy's death, exhibition reveals his ties to Germany A century ago, Leo Tolstoy - perhaps the greatest novelist of all time - died at a remote train station. He had embarked on a journey to find the simple life he believed in - partly due to early German influences. \"A light rose up within me,\" wrote Leo Tolstoy in German in his diary of his encounter with the German-Jewish author Berthold Auerbach in Berlin in 1861. It wasn't unusual for Tolstoy to express himself in a foreign language: Many of the Russian writer's handwritten notes were in German. Tolstoy's diaries, currently part of an exhibition at the Literaturhaus in Munich, bear testimony to his interest in the German language. \"There are German expressions throughout [the diary],\" said curator Johanna Doering-Smirnov. \"And the crazy thing is that 20 or 30 years later they turn out to be important for some of his works.\" Copies of Tolstoy's travel journals from 1857-1861, excerpts from correspondence with some of his 2,000 German readers and other valuable historical documents are on display at in Munich through January 2011. They reveal just how familiar the Russian literary legend was with Germany. \"He loved Germany: He loved German music, Beethoven, Bach, the philosophers and the German writers whose works he could read in German,\" explained Svetlana Novikova from the Tolstoy Museum in Moscow. Developing his character Tolstoy has his German tutor, Friedrich Roessl, to thank for his language competency. \"He was a deserted soldier and a cobbler - a relatively simple person,\" Doering-Smirnov said of the German tutor, \"but with traits that Tolstoy apparently picked up from him: compassion and empathy.\" It was another German who helped develop young Tolstoy's strong sense of justice while he was studying at Kazan University. Professor Meyer gave the then 17-year-old Tolstoy the assignment of comparing Russia's German-born Empress Catherine the Great to the 17th-century French Enlightenment philosopher Montesquieu. The latter is known for developing the theory of separation of power in government, prohibiting any one from having more power than the others. \"That impressed Tolstoy so much that he became a critic of the tsars,\" said Doering-Smirnov. \"But, most importantly, he learned about social responsibility from Meyer and that it's important not just to philosophize but that philosophy also has to be practically implemented.\" After dropping out of the university, Tolstoy returned to his family's estate in Yasnaya Polyana in central Russia and attempted to put his new ideas about ruling with a social conscience into practice. He was particularly interested in educating the peasant population. On later trips to Germany, he sought examples in vain and complained in his travel journals about the harsh discipline and rote learning he observed in German schools. Defining freedom from within Tolstoy's connection to Germany grew even stronger in 1862 when he married German-Russian Countess Sophia Andreyevna Behrs, 16 years his junior. They would have 13 children, five of whom died before reaching adulthood. The marriage is said to have begun strong but disintegrated when Tolstoy's beliefs became more radical and he chose to renounce his wealth and even his copyrights and lead a peasant life. At the age of 82, Tolstoy was unhappy with the strife at home and left, despite being in poor health. He died several days later, on November 20, 1910, at a train station not far from his home. According to his wishes, he was buried in an unmarked grave in his birth town, Yasnaya Polyana. \"What we can learn from him is that freedom is not something that is defined by external circumstances, but is an internal spiritual development,\" commented the director of Moscow's Tolstoy Museum, Vitaly Remizov.

"story": "Only 4 of Germany's 128 Eurofighter jets combat ready \u2014 report The report is the latest to cast doubt on Germany's military capabilities and readiness. It raises questions of whether Germany is really meeting its NATO commitments.  Only a handful of the German Air Force's Eurofighter jets are combat ready, according to a report in the magazine Der Spiegel published Wednesday. Due to a technical problem with the defense system of the combat aircraft only 10 of the Luftwaffe's 128 Eurofighters are mission ready, according to the report. The problem stems from a cooling liquid leak in the aircraft's wing pod sensors, which are used to recognize hostile jets or incoming attacks. Without the defense system the Eurofighter jets are not combat ready. The shortage of aircraft means that Germany is unable to fulfill its NATO obligations to have 82 combat ready jets for crisis situations. Read more: How does Germany contribute to NATO? The wing pod issue is only one problem facing the Luftwaffe. Der Spiegel reported that there are only enough missiles to make only four Eurofigher jets ready for combat. The German military confirmed to Der Spiegel the technical problems with the Eurofighter, but would not comment on the number of combat-ready aircraft, given that this information is classified. The revelation in Der Spiegel is the latest report to cast doubt on Germany's military readiness and capabilities. Read more: German military short on tanks for NATO mission Germany's lack of military readiness 'dramatic,' says Bundeswehr commissioner Accounting tricks In a Bundeswehr document provided to the German parliament last year, the military classified 39 of 128 jets as combat ready. A Bundeswehr spokesperson told Der Spiegel that the \"daily actual availability\" of the Eurofighter right now is better than last year. However, Der Spiegel said that the military appeared to count any Eurofighter that can fly as ready, even if they are only available for training or maneuvers without missiles or defense systems. \"These jets are barred from participating in real deployments, such as air patrols in the eastern flank of NATO,\" Der Spiegel wrote.

In addition, he and his family faced persecution because of their religious beliefs. \"Things had reached a peak,\" he said, forcing him and his family to leave Mosul and go to Germany in search of safety and religious freedom. Rani arrived in Germany in September 2011, following a \"long and arduous journey in which he and his family were exposed to many dangers,\" he told InfoMigrants. It took only three months for the Iraqi family's request for asylum to be recognized, but this was not enough for them to feel secure. Rani wanted to find a apartment so he could leave the refugee shelter, but this was not easy. Like other refugees, Rani receives monthly state aid, but landlords do not look favorably on this, making it difficult to find an apartment to rent. Moving into self-employment After a long search, Rani managed to find an apartment to live with his family. He also began to learn German. Rani did not want to continue receiving aid from the state and wanted to get his own source of income. For about four years he tried to work in various fields, such as construction or in restaurants. But he was not satisfied with these areas of work. \"Working these types of jobs did not guarantee me enough income. We are a family of four,\" he said. Rani did not have sufficient educational qualifications to work in areas that could increase his income. \"In recent years, the neighborhood I live in has witnessed the arrival of many Arab refugees,\" he said. This led him to think about opening up his own business. Rami's decision to move into self-employment was welcomed by the German labor office. An employee there enrolled him in a training course to help him understand the basics of self-employment in Germany. He learned how to \"calculate profits and losses, better understand self-employment law and recognize my rights and duties of being self-employed in Germany.\" After he successfully completed the training course, he had to go to a German government department that would carry out an economic study on an entrepreneurial project he submitted. Once the study was completed, he would receive government funding toward his project. Rani was shocked when he found out his project was rejected because it was deemed \"impossible to succeed.\" But Rani did not despair and began looking for an alternative solution: \"I got a small loan from a friend and looked for a small space with low rent. I managed to achieve my dream.\" Finding success The project started small and his financial resources were limited but Rani began to buy food products that he would then resell. He was able to develop the project further thanks to the profit he was making. The grocery store was attracting customers of all different nationalities: \"Along with Iraqi, Syrian and Egyptian customers, we also had Germans and Turks,\" he said. When asked about his secret to success he remarks: \"At the beginning it took a lot of patience but with the help from my wife and brother I was able to persevere. Never forget that the way one treats the customer is very important.\" Rani hopes that in the future he could open up another shop to sell and repair mobile phones. He has extensive experience in the field from his home country. He advises refugees \"to learn German, as that is the key to success here and helps a lot when searching for a job.\" \"Those who study, learn and work here live a better life than back home and enjoy many rights,\" he concludes. \u00a9 Copyright -- InfoMigrants All Rights Reserved InfoMigrants is not responsible for the content of external websites Source: InfoMigrants2017",

"story": "China's new Silk Road summit opens with major funding vision Announcing billions of yuan in financing, China's president has promised to assist countries along the new Silk Road. The ambitious \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative aims to expand links between Asia, Europe and Africa. Chinese President Xi Jinping on Sunday announced that Beijing will lend 380 billion yuan (50.37 billion euros, $55.09 billion) to support cooperation on its ambitious \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative to expand links between Asia, Africa and Europe. \"We should build an open platform of cooperation and uphold and grow an open world economy,\" said Xi during the opening of the two-day summit on the new Silk Road. \"We should jointly create an environment that will facilitate opening up and development - establish a fair, equitable and transparent system of international trade and investment rules,\" the Chinese president added. Xi said that Beijing will also contribute an additional 100 billion yuan to the Silk Road Fund, which aims to bankroll the country's plans to build the infrastructure network for improved intercontinental trade. The attendees included Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, Russian President Vladimir Putin and UN chief Antonio Guterres. Putin said at the conference that protectionism is a threat to the global economy amid a resurgence of isolationist rhetoric on the international stage. North Korea's shadow Despite the notable absence of Western leaders at China's biggest diplomatic event this year, Xi said all countries are welcome to cooperate on the project. The US embassy in Beijing expressed concern to China for its decision to invite North Korea, which has escalated tensions in the region through multiple missile test-launches since US President Donald Trump assumed office in January. However, China's foreign ministry said in a statement that it did \"not understand the situation.\" \"The Belt and Road initiative is an open and inclusive one. We welcome all countries' delegations to attend the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation,\" the foreign ministry said. Earlier on Sunday, North Korea launched a test missile believed to be a new model. The test launch prompted outrage from South Korea and Japan, saying it violated numerous UN resolutions and undermined international security. ls/rc (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa)",

"story": "Haltern after the Germanwings crash: 'All laughter has perished' Hundreds of journalists and thousands of questions fill the town, but the people facing the deluge want just one simple question to be answered: Why? DW's Jan Walter reports from Haltern. Sixteen children and two young women from the western-German town of Haltern died in the plane crash in the southern French Alps. That's the only real certainty that relatives, colleagues and friends truly have right now. One day after the accident, the street approaching the Joseph-K\u00f6nig-Gymnasium high school is littered with film crew trucks belonging to broadcasters from Germany, Europe and the world. The school grounds, the starting point for a student exchange trip to Spain, are closed off to the public. On one side of the red-and-white cordoning tape stand camera crews, photographers and journalists grasping microphones. On the other side stand the mourners: children, youths and adults. They hold each other's hands, or hug, some of them stand alone, bending down to lay a wreath, or to light one of the countless candles which adorn the steps to the school entrance. Across the cordon People come and go, often with bowed heads, and bloodshot eyes. \"I didn't sleep at all last night,\" one woman stutters into the microphone of an Italian journalist. One student, who looks like a senior, decides to face a whole handful of camera crews, answering their questions. Yes, he did know some of the victims. He chooses a language, one might presume, that he knows from watching news reporting at home: \"We are most deeply shocked.\" His body language seems to suggest that he's not quite sure himself whether it's right to talk to the press, or whether it's not respectful enough. Head teacher Ulrich Wessel, meanwhile, considers himself obliged to face the media. \"I am the school's principal, I sent that group on their trip,\" he tells the press corps. \"Therefore I will face your questions, and any the parents might have.\" At the press conference at Haltern's town hall, Wessel has support at his side from the state's education minister, Sylvia L\u00f6hrmann, Haltern's mayor, Bodo Klimpel, and Cay S\u00fcberkr\u00fcb of the local council. Minister L\u00f6hrmann is a teacher herself, she might well have an idea of the gaping wound such a tragedy can inflict on a school community. However, she does not presume to know this, instead sticking to modest truisms when explaining her role in proceedings: \"We cannot take anybody's grief, we can only share it.\" 'People from all over the world' Journalists pose perhaps the most personal questions to school principal Wessel. How did you learn the terrible news? How painful was it to tell parents about the accident? Do you feel at all responsible for this inconceivable tragedy? Wessel puts a brave face on things, sometimes pausing briefly to swallow down the lump which keeps forming in his throat. Still, when giving voice to some of his thoughts, his eyes often well up: \"At our school, all laughter has perished,\" he says, adding that he doesn't know when it might return. For now, people will just have to survive this day, and then the next, he says. Condolences can certainly help in this regard, Wessel says, explaining that the town hall and his school have been inundated with well-wishes. \"People who have never had any contact with our school - people from all over the world - are expressing their sympathy,\" Wessel says, adding that he sees the matter similarly even among the sea of journalists who have flooded the lakeside town. \"I do not consider this interest to be cheap or sensationalist at all. I know that it's the feelings of your readers and your viewers drawing you all here.\"",

"story": "Shanghai's new FTZ: 'A testing ground for reforms' Operations at a new free trade zone in Shanghai recently kicked off in what is regarded as a laboratory for testing reforms that have been difficult to implement in the whole of China, says analyst Nicola Casarini. Located in the outskirts of Shanghai, the new China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone (FTZ) covers four existing 'bonded zones' in the eastern Chinese megacity, including the Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone, Waigaoqiao Free Trade Logistics Park, Yangshan Free Trade Port Area and the Pudong Airport Comprehensive Free Trade Zone. China's State Council or cabinet, which approved the project back in July, recently unveiled on its website a set of rules for the new pilot zone. Some 25 companies have so far been given the green light to start operations in a variety of sectors, alongside 11 financial institutions. In a DW interview, China expert Nicola Casarini says that if the FTZ is successful, it could pave the way for long-awaited economic reforms, such as the convertibility of the Chinese currency, the Renminbi. DW: The FTZ was formally launched on September 29. When will it be in business? Nicola Casarini: According to the announcements, it technically has been in business since Sunday. However, as China prepares for a week-long festivity starting on October 1st (foundation of the People's Republic of China), there will be no significant business until the middle of next week. What is the main purpose of the Shanghai Free Trade Zone? The zone is about 29 square kilometers (11-square-mile) in size. According to the government, it will serve as a testing ground for financial reforms, in particular, interest rate deregulation, a convertible exchange rate and an elimination of investment restrictions for foreign companies. What is special about the new Shanghai FTZ? It is special because it will be used as a laboratory for testing reforms that are difficult, if not impossible, to implement nationwide. Some reforms such as opening up the domestic service sector and the liberalization of capital accounts encounter stiff opposition from important sectors of the bureaucracy and the Communist Party of China (CPC). It is this that makes the Shanghai Free Trade Zone so special. What will foreigners be able to do? Do the same privileges apply for Chinese working within the free trade zone? The foreigners will be able to do the same things as the Chinese. Moreover, there have been rumors that both foreigners and Chinese in the FTZ will have access to social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter which are otherwise blocked in the rest of China. How significant is this new trade zone for China - both in terms of trade and of economic reforms? Extremely important. If successful after the three-year test period, it could pave the way - among other things - to the convertibility of the Renminbi, the Chinese currency. This will have a huge impact on trade and economic reforms. What is the CPC aiming at by establishing this free trade zone? The CPC is indicating that China is serious about economic and financial reforms and that it is aware of the huge challenges that it needs to undertake in order to graduate to the next phase of economic development and escape the middle-income trap. Nicola Casarini is an expert in EU-China relations at the Paris-based European Union Institute for Security Studies (EUISS). The interview was conducted by Gabriel Dom\u00ednguez.",

"story": "Terrorism Tops the Agenda in Warsaw As the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member Council of Europe enters its last day in Warsaw, talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime. Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski warned Council of Europe member states Friday against paralyzing democracy in the fight against organised crime and terrorism. \"We must be careful to avoid that the fight against terrorism and organized crime do not paralyze the smooth functioning of a normal democratic society. We must not lose what constitutes the basis of a democratic society,\" said Kwasniewski, whose country has chaired the Council's Committee of Ministers since November. \"Given that criminal activity transcends national borders, we must reinforce cooperation among our intelligence services and better control the flow of people and merchandise,\" Kwasniewski told the meeting in Warsaw. But he stressed that any moves to clamp down on organized crime and terrorism must be taken with respect for individual freedoms. Developing strategies Ministerial-level meetings at the conference are being held behind closed doors and are focussing on special investigative techniques, the protection of witnesses, money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The officials are also debating two draft conventions aimed at nipping in the bud terrorism and other forms of serious crime in the early, preparative stages. The draft convention on the prevention of terrorism proposes criminalizing acts deemed as laying the groundwork for a terrorist attack, such as provocation of terrorism, recruitment and training. \"We can't wait for another Madrid\" On Thursday, the Council's Secretary General Terry Davis (photo) urged delegates to move quickly and decisively against terrorism. \"We can't wait for another Madrid or Beslan,\" he said, calling on delegates \"to provide a message of support for the new instruments\" being debated at the two-day meeting. More than 340 people died, half of them children, when a standoff between law enforcement authorities and hostage-takers who had herded more than 1,000 students and teachers into a school in the southern Russian town of Beslan last September ended in a chaotic shootout. The bombing of four Madrid commuter trains on March 11 last year killed 191 people and injured over 1,900. Fleshing out the anti-terror convention Negotiating the terms of the anti-terror convention, expected to be ready by May, showed \"how difficult it can be to enhance the efficiency of the fight against terrorism at the same time as safeguarding fundamental human rights,\" said Davis, a former British lawmaker. \"But it has also shown that it is possible to reconcile these twin objectives.\" \"Terrorism is an attack on human rights,\" he went on. \"However, while tackling terrorism, we must be careful not to undermine human rights,\" he said. Davis said he expected recommendations on the topics debated by the conference as well as the new conventions to be adopted by the end of the month. They will then be presented to a summit of Council of Europe heads of state and government due to be held in Warsaw in May. In addition to its 46 members, five states which have observer status on the Council of Europe were also represented at the meeting: Canada, Japan, Mexico, the United States and the Vatican.",

"story": "Scientists grow early-stage human eggs in lab to full maturity British and US scientists have developed eggs from an early stage to full maturity in a lab for the first time. The technique could offer cancer patients a promising new type of fertility treatment. Scientists have succeeded in growing early-stage human egg cells to full maturity in a laboratory for the first time, according to a study released on Friday. The findings, which were published in the journal Molecular Human Reproduction, could be used to create new fertility treatments in the future. The work by researchers at the University of Edinburgh and the Center for Human Reproduction took ovarian tissue and matured it to the point at which it could be fertilized. Previous studies had created live offspring from mice eggs matured in a laboratory and developed late-stage human eggs to a later stage of maturity. Potential breakthrough Women who undergo chemotherapy for cancer treatment, which can cause sterility, stand to benefit the most if scientists are able to perfect the new technique. Patients can currently opt to have ovarian tissue removed before therapy to be re-implanted afterwards. But the procedure is risky because the re-implanted tissue can cause a new outbreak of cancer. But with the new technique, eggs could be frozen ahead of the treatment and later matured in a laboratory to the point at which they could be fertilized. More work needed Scientists who were not part of the study welcomed the findings, but cautioned that fertility patients would have to wait for new treatments. \"This is an elegant piece of work,\" Channa Jayasena of the Imperial College London told AFP news agency, yet he added: \"It would take several years to translate this [technique] into a therapy.\" \"Much more work is needed to make sure that the technique is safe and optimized before we ascertain whether these eggs \u2026 can be fertilized,\" Ali Abbara, also from Imperial College London, told Reuters news agency.

"story": "Rights body accuses Mexican police of arbitrary executions Mexico's National Human Rights Commission has said police massacred 22 civilians in the western state of Michoacan last year. Police say they acted in self defense, and that the killings were not arbitrary executions. The National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) on Thursday said the police had committed \"violations of the right to life by excessive use of force that entailed the arbitrary execution of 22 civilians.\" Officers were also said to have been guilty of \"aggravated acts of torture on two people who were detained.\" At least 42 people suspected of being Jalisco New Generation Cartel gang members were killed, while only one police officer died in the raid on a ranch near the small town of Tanhuato. The CNDH said police had lied about their role during the incident, where they shifted 7 bodies and planted weapons on some of them. It was unclear how or why another 15 of those who died had been killed. \"As a result of the investigation done by this organization, based on technical and scientific tests ... we established facts that imply grave human rights violations attributable to public servants of the federal police,\" said Raul Gonzalez, the president of the CNDH. Killings 'in self defense' The findings would appear to contradict the government's claim that 42 people who were killed had attacked officers. A Black Hawk helicopter was employed to \"contain the suspects.\" The Mexican federal police, army and navy have repeatedly been accused of abuses in a drug conflict that has claimed more than 100,000 lives since it began in 2006. Mexico's national security commissioner Renato Sales denied that police had carried out arbitrary killings and executions, and said the investigation was continuing. He urged Congress to pass laws on when security forces can fire weapons. \"In our view, the use of arms was necessary and proportional to the very real, imminent and lawless aggression,\" he said. \"They acted in legitimate defense.\" rc/kl (AP AFP, Reuters)",

"story": "Philosophy goes high gloss in Germany Thoughts on life's big questions are hitting German kiosks. Two new philosophy magazines have appeared recently. Publishers see an unmet need for philosophical reflection in the country's media. On the cover, a child's legs protrude from a pair of clunky, brown men's shoes. The image bears a question: \"Why do we have kids?\" \"Philosophie Magazin\" (Philosophy Magazine) is among the latest efforts at thrusting philosophy into the public eye. \"It's a magazine that takes its questions to the marketplace, letting the public help feel them out,\" editor-in-chief Wolfram Eilenberger wrote in an editorial in the magazine. That's also what a second new philosophy magazine seeks to accomplish. Called \"Hohe Luft\" (Literally: High Air), its editors hope to offer philosophy \"for everyone who's interested in reading and thinking.\" A rather big target audience indeed. And right with the first edition, readers are confronted with a big question to ponder: \"You shouldn't lie - but why not exactly?\" Perhaps the better question is why do two publishers now think that German readers want to explore the mysteries of life in high gloss format? \"I believe that there are two developments involved. One is that, in our society, the traditional organizational structures like religion are losing significance,\" explained Michael Quante, director of the German Society for Philosophy, \"That means that more and more people are trying to get their questions answered in other places.\" Quante added that the world has become more complex through globalization and the associated phenomena of rapid technological development and social change. The new magazines are out to offer new perspectives - something for audiences to chew on in the form of bite-size chunks of philosophy, garnished, of course, with a chic layout and large-scale pictures. Bestseller philosophy But the idea of philosophy stepping out from behind its academic shadow and addressing a broader public is not new. \"When you look at the 19th century or the French intellectuals of the 20th century, back then there were very important personalities and voices in philosophy that discussed relevant questions outside of the academic establishment,\" said Michael Quante. Norwegian Jostein Gaarder struck success with his 1991 history of philosophy for laypeople in \"Sophie's World.\" In Germany, the 2007 title \"Wer bin ich und wenn ja, wie viele\" (Who am I and if so, how many?) by author Richard David Precht also topped bestseller lists. The book went on to become 2008's most successful nonfiction hardcover, and its author has since become almost inescapable on the TV circuit of Germany's evening talk and debate shows. The trend toward popular philosophy goes beyond German borders. Next door, a French-language version of Philosophie Magazin has been in print since 2006. \"In France, philosophy is a required subject through the end of school in the entire country, not just in certain regions, like in Germany,\" said Claudia Bickmann of the Society for Intercultural Philosophy, adding that French people in general have a better education in basic philosophical issues and figures. \"With around 300 salons and a number of magazines dedicated to the subject, philosophical life in France is lively and multilayered,\" Bickmann said. However, in Anglo-Saxon countries, the subject is more of a specialty discipline taught almost exclusively at universities. Changing course In China, Bickmann said, philosophy seems to be taking on an increasingly important role in society. \"It seems as though the orientation sometimes shifts away from Confucius' teachings of promoting harmony and toward the hegemony of the communist party. The coming years will show whether the party or a renewed approach to Confucius' teachings will pave the way for the country,\" she said. In the Arabic world, philosophy is also playing a significant role in social and political affairs, particularly \"in the various democracy movements,\" Bickmann believes. These days, everyone can be a philosopher - at least that's what the new philosophy magazines seem to suggest. On Philosophie Magazin's Facebook page, people can sound off on what they think counts in life. But whether that lives up to what most mean by philosophy is an open question. That the subject loses somewhat on depth and substance is a natural consequence for any discipline that attracts a large audience, pointed out philosophy professor Michael Quante. \"When a professor of physics or biology gives a public address, certain concessions for the sake of understandability have to be made, and that's legitimate,\" Quante said. For him, a popular approach to philosophy doesn't hinder the subject from remaining a serious area of academic study. But he hopes that a mass embrace of deep thinking won't fall into pseudo-philosophy. Quante said the marks of fake philosophy are \"a lack of argumentation and the rational justification of positions and worldviews.\" Author: Laura D\u00f6ing / gsw Editor: Kate Bowen",

"story": "Documentary on anti-Semitism in Europe to be screened, despite controversy  German-French public broadcaster Arte received criticism for deciding not to show the film. Then, Germany's largest tabloid made it available online. Now, the documentary will be screened on TV. On Wednesday, the documentary titled \"Chosen and Excluded - Jew Hatred in Europe\" will be shown on German television. On June 21, the film will be broadcast at 10:15 pm on the public channel ARD. The documentary about discrimination against Jews in Europe was commissioned by the German-French broadcaster Arte. After an editor accepted the film and the filmmakers Sophie Hafner and Joachim Schroeder received their fee, Arte refused to screen the film. The reason, said the broadcaster, was that the subject matter did not correspond to the project as it was initially described. Instead of focusing on growing anti-Semitism in Europe, the film focused instead on the Middle East. The editorial offices were \"deliberately left in the dark\" about the changes until immediately before the film was delivered, according to Arte. Additionally, there were \"concerns\" related to the film's \"craftsmanship.\" Allegations and accusations without confrontation For this reason, the station WDR, which commissioned the film with Arte, investigated the documentary's content. In the opinion of the review team, it contains facts which are not sufficiently substantiated with supporting documentation. Furthermore, there were allegations against individuals in the film who were then not given the opportunity to comment. Allowing comment is considered standard journalistic practice. However, the documentary will be screened regardless and viewers will be able to make up their own minds about the content. In order to allow different positions to be heard, the station has planned a discussion panel, which will air after the documentary is broadcast. Criticism against public broadcasters Arte and WDR's approach to the issue has caused a stir. The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Josef Schuster, said in a letter to the stations he was surprised that the documentary would not be screened as planned. Historians such as Michael Wolffsohn and G\u00f6tz Aly praised the film. Aly even accused the Arte program director of censorship. On June 13, Germany's largest tabloid \"Bild\" put the documentary online for 24 hours. According to the publication's own data, it received around 200,000 clicks. ld/sh/als (epd, dpa)",

"story": "Sri Lanka launches new port in Hambantota The port on the southern coast is part of the Sri Lankan president's plan to transform his country into a major trading hub and rebuild the infrastructure after 25 years of civil war. It has been built with China's help. As the new harbor in the southern city of Hambantota was flooded with sea water, President Mahinda Rajapaksa promised it would provide the basis of Sri Lanka's future prosperity. \"The maritime and naval economy built up through this port will lead to industries requiring new and varied skills, professional services, banking and financial institutions, and will open new paths to take our produce to the world outside. This is a free port,\" he said. The port has been constructed at a cost of $360 million (280 million euros) and over 85 percent of this was loaned by the Export-Import Bank of China. China Harbour Engineering, which is part of a state-owned company, has been doing the building. \"Our country was situated on the route between China and southern Europe. The offer by China to build this port on the old Silk Route reminds us again of our traditional friendship. I offer my heartfelt gratitude,\" President Rajapaksa said solemnly on Monday. Chinese interest is beneficial to Sri Lanka The president has said that he originally asked Indian officials to help with the project but they rejected it. China apparently then offered the best terms of all the bidders. \"China has funded and developed this port and it is of great strategic interest to China to develop some sort of a foothold within Sri Lanka,\" said Charu Lata Hogg from Chatham House in London. \"The Chinese economic interest is extremely beneficial to Sri Lanka because it takes away the pressure on Sri Lanka from being reliant either on the West or India.\" How worrisome is the port for India? Some security experts in India have expressed their fear that China's involvement is part of its String of Pearls strategy to build a network of ports across the Indian Ocean. Charu Lata Hogg argued that India did have reason to be concerned but said it was \"hard to pinpoint how worrisome it is for India, partly because of its expansive role, not only as far as the sub-region is concerned but globally.\" However, she added, \"it does matter to India because it tests its influence within the region. As we saw in May 2009, in the last days of the conflict, it was essentially Chinese help in terms of arms supplies that helped Sri Lanka win the war against the Tamil Tigers. Given that scenario, Sri Lanka's economic and political reliance on India has decreased.\" But Hogg also pointed out that the economic and strategic partnership Colombo and Beijing currently enjoyed was offset by the \"cultural influence\" India felt it had on Sri Lanka. 2,500 ships a year initially Officials said that the new port would start handling ships from November onwards. It will provide refueling services for ships using sea lanes nearby. The new harbor has been designed to initially handle 2,500 ships a year to take off some of the pressure from the country's only port in Colombo, which handles some 6,000 ships annually. At the end of the three phases, it is expected to be able to deal with 7,000 ships. Author: Anne Thomas Editor: Disha Uppal",

"story": "German lawmakers call off Turkey visit as row escalates A German parliamentary delegation has cancelled a trip to Turkey after authorities there said that the group would be unwelcome. It\u2019s the latest row to hit increasingly strained relations between the NATO allies.  A delegation of German lawmakers called off a trip to Turkey after they were told that they would not be able to meet with Turkish officials or visit parliament, Green Party deputy parliamentary speaker Claudia Roth said on Wednesday. \"Yesterday we received the information that it is currently not considered opportune at the very, very, very highest Turkish level to conduct political talks with the German parliamentary side in Turkey,\" Roth said in Berlin, adding that the Turkish side refused to provide a security detail. She was to lead a four-person parliamentary delegation that included the Social Democrats' foreign policy spokesperson, the head of the German parliament's human rights commission of the Christian Democrats, and another Green lawmaker. The three-day visit scheduled to begin on Thursday was to include stops in Istanbul, Ankara and the largely Kurdish city of Diyarbakir to gain information following April's controversial constitutional referendum that granted President Recep Tayyip Erdogan greater powers. Read: What happens following 'yes' vote in Turkish referendum Roth spoke of a \"new level of escalation\" and \"a de facto cancellation of political dialogue\" between the two NATO allies. In China on an official visit, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel called Turkey's actions a \"serious event\" that did not help make dialogue any easier. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Erdogan will attend a NATO summit in Brussels on Thursday. The two leaders are likely to hold discussions on the sidelines. Blow after blow Wednesday's cancellation adds to increasingly strained ties since early last year. Relations with Turkey have also become a political football ahead national elections in Germany in September. Turkey recently blocked a parliamentary delegation from visiting Incirlik air base, where some 260 German soldiers are stationed as part of the international anti-Islamic State coalition in Syria. Read: Turkey's Incirlik air base: What you need to know In response, Germany is considering moving its troops and reconnaissance and refueling aircraft to another base in the region, possibly in Jordan. It is the second time Turkey has blocked a parliamentary delegation from visiting its troops. After the German parliament passed an Armenian genocide resolution last year Turkey blocked lawmakers from visiting Incirlik, only to later to allow the trip. Tensions have also been heightened over the arrest of two Turkish-German journalists on trumped up terrorism charges. Read: The 100th day of Deniz Yucel's imprisonment In another row, Germany granted asylum to military officers and other diplomatic passport holders who Ankara accuses of being involved in last July's failed coup attempt. Germany and the EU have voiced concern over the deterioration of democracy and human rights in the wake of coup attempt.

"story": "Germany coach Loew could end 'special relationship' with Podolski As Germany try to keep their perfect Euro 2012 qualification record intact against minnows Kazakhstan on Tuesday, the mood in the squad is buoyant. But not everything's hunky-dory in the House of Loew. With one exception, Joachim Loew's pulse probably remained pretty even as he watched his squad beat Turkey 3-0 last Friday. In the 70th minute, the Germany coach hammered a stray football into the stands after witnessing one of his players miss a sitter in front of the Turkish goal. The culprit was Lukas Podolski. The Cologne attacker was one of the few members of the squad not to impress against the Turks, and that must have been particularly irritating to Loew, who's stayed loyal to Podolski despite his anything but stellar form in the Bundesliga. It wasn\u2019t just that Podolski squandered the chance to seal the match, in which the score at that point only stood at 1-0. He was also generally ineffective on the left side, failing to execute simple passes and lacking the sort of inspiration shown by his counterpart on the right, Thomas Mueller. Podolski - once one of German football's most promising youngsters - was also pretty bland at the 2010 World Cup, raising the question of how long Loew can stick with him. And the intensity with which such questions will be asked is likely to rise and rise since Germany is currently enjoying a golden generation of attacking midfielders-wingers. Bidding for spots One player who definitely did impress on Friday was Toni Kroos. The Bayern midfielder did an admirable job filling in for the injured Bastian Schweinsteiger in a defensive, holding role. The 20-year-old was playing out of position, but you wouldn't have known that, as he combined perfectly with Real Madrid's Sami Khedira to disrupt the Turks' faltering thrusts forward. With Khedira, Mueller and Mesut Oezil having cemented their places in Germany's starting eleven, Schweinsteiger's return will mean someone will have to yield. After Friday's match, it was easy to see Kroos, who's good with both feet, being moved further upfield - and Poldi being switched to the bench. Making matters worse for the player formerly known as Prince Poldi, there are a host of youngsters who just missed out making the squad this time, but who could command a look next March, when Loew will nominate a new team. Midfielder Lewis Holtby and winger Andre Schuerrle are currently ripping the Bundesliga apart with Mainz and have been mainstays of Germany's under-21 team. Loew boldly promoted youngsters like Mueller and Holger Badstuber ahead of Germany's World Cup campaign, and it would be in keeping with the coach's stated philosophy, if he bet again on youth for Poland and Ukraine. Other problem areas Germany's international matches in the coming months are about more than just qualifying for Euro 2012. Loew also has to put together a team capable of beating Spain, the nation that has dumped the Nationalelf out of the previous two major tournaments. As good as Germany's midfield is, the squad won't be able to better the Spaniards in this area as the latter are blessed with extraordinary talents such as Xavi and Iniesta. If the Germans are to put this bete noire -- or perhaps better still bete rouge -- behind them, they will have to excel all over the pitch. And the squad still has some notable weaknesses. Heiko Westermann did an okay job at left back against Turkey, but that's clearly not his natural position. The same applies to Badstuber and Jerome Boateng, who's only starting to recover his form after injury. That problem dogged Germany at the World Cup, and inability to build up pressure on the left was one reason Loew's men came up short against Spain. Another potential concern is center-forward. Despite a prolonged goal drought in the Bundesliga, Miroslav Klose continues to be in the right place at the right time whenever he dons a national team shirt. But Klose will be 34 years old by the time the ball gets rolling in Poland and Ukraine, and it's unclear who could replace him if he got hurt. Cacau is a different sort of forward, while Stefan Kiessling is injured long term, and Mario Gomez seems to have completely lost the plot. And a big target man is crucial to the 4-2-3-1 system Loew employed to such effect in South Africa. Unfortunately for Loew, there aren't any hot young talents making waves in these positions in the Bundesliga. If that situation doesn't change, Germany's embarrassment of riches in midfield might not be enough for Loew to achieve his stated aim for 2012 - leading the team to their first major international title since 1996.

"story": "Leverkusen move up thanks to Bremen loss While the league leaders await their fate in Sunday's matches, Leverkusen made a move up the table on Saturday, beating Cologne and moving past Werder Bremen, who lost at home to Nuremberg. In the last of Saturday's Bundesliga matches on match-day 23, Nuremberg upset Werder Bremen 1-0 in Bremen. The loss dropped Bremen down to sixth place in the table after Bayer Leverkusen won earlier in the day against Cologne. The evening game featured an hour of hard fought but scoreless soccer, but a lapse in Bremen's defense allowed Nuremberg to take the lead in the 65th minute. Nuremberg's Timothy Chandler had the ball on the right side of the area, and Bremen's back line shifted in his direction. The move left striker Alexander Esswein all alone for a long pass from Chandler. Esswein only had Bremen's keeper Tim Wiese to beat, and coolly slotted past the keeper and into the net. Leverkusen wins Rhineland derby Bremen's loss only added to Bayer Leverkusen's joy on Saturday, having previously beaten Cologne in the Rhineland derby 2-0. Their win in Cologne combined with Bremen's loss meant the two teams switched places in the table, with Leverkusen moving into fifth on 37 points, and Bremen dropping to sixth on 26. Lars Bender scored both of Leverkusen's goals. The first came in the 16th minute, and although Bender gets the goal in the scoreline, several Leverkusen players took part in setting up the goal off a corner kick. The kick first found \u00d6mer Toprak, who headed toward Stefan Reinartz. Reinartz's header bounced off the post. Vedran Corluka took a shot on the rebound, which was headed for the goal, and Bender put an extra foot on it for good measure to keep it out of reach of any defenders. Bender's second goal was in the 51st minute and was set up by an excellent pass from Renato Augusto. For Cologne, the loss is the sixth in the last seven, increasing pressure on coach Stale Solbakken. Cologne star Lukas Podolski, back on the pitch after an injury, said it's not the coach's fault. \"The coach can't be blamed,\" he said after the game. \"He was brought here to build up a team. He should be allowed time for that.\" Mainzon the move Mohamed Zidan proved his value to Mainz yet again on Saturday against Kaiserslautern. Just two minutes in, Zidan had found the goal and put Mainz in the lead to the delight of the home fans. It's his fourth goal in as many games since returning to Mainz for the third time in his career - the only time a winter transfer has ever scored in all of his first four games. \"We just let Zidan be Zidan,\" said Mainz's sporting director Christian Heidel in an interview with Sky TV after the match against Kaiserslautern. \"He's a lively character.\" Adam Szalai followed up in the 17th minute on a play where Mainz took perfect advantage of Kaiserslautern weak back line. Elkin Soto received a pass that split the defenders before firing straight away to Szalai, who easily scored from directly in front of the goal. Nicolai M\u00fcller made it 3-0 in the 30th, taking the ball up the right side and getting off a shot despite pressure from two defenders. Credit Kaiserslautern defender Nicolai J\u00f6rgensen with an assist on Mainz's final goal in the 74th minute: J\u00f6rgensen tried to clear the ball from the area but hit it with the wrong side of his foot, allowing Maxim Choupo-Moting to pick up the misfired ball and put it in the goal from close range. Kaiserslautern's coach, Marco Kurz, was somber after the match. \"This was the low point since I've been here and also of this season,\" he said. \"It was a catastrophe. What this means for me [as coach], I can't say.\" Uh-oh, Otto Otto Rehhagel's debut on the bench for Hertha Berlin was not a good one, with a few minutes of poor defense costing Hertha the match against Augsburg. After a scoreless first half, Matthias Ostrzolek came quickly up the left side for Augsburg before flanking into the middle for Ja-Cheol Koo, who fed Torsten Oehrl in front of the goal to finish the play. Two minutes later, it was Oehrl again, this time taking the initiative himself and beating Hertha defenders Roman Hubnik and Felix Bastians before getting the better of keeper Thomas Kraft yet again. The goals were Oehrl's second and third of the season. Augsburgadded one more goal in injury time from Marcel Ndjeng for a final score of 3-0. The 73-year-old Rehhagel returned to the head of a German team for the first time in dozen years. He is tasked with righting a sinking ship at Hertha, who dropped to 16th in the table. \"Augsburg fought like lions,\" said Rehhagel after the match. \"Our team hasn't won a game since December, it's obvious that we can't play like FC Barcelona.\" First win for Babbel It only took 86 seconds for Hoffenheim to take the lead against Wolfsburg, with Roberto Firmino cleaning up a dropped save by Wolfsburg keeper Diego Benalgio. Over an hour went by, with the home team Wolfsburg looking for an equalizer to at least secure a point after last week's 4-0 against Schalke, before they caught a break. Hoffenheim's Andreas Beck fouled Marcel Sch\u00e4fer, giving the Wolves a penalty which was converted by Patrick Helmes. The hope of a point was short-lived, though, as Sven Schipplock scored the game-winner in the 84th minute, nine minutes after coming off the bench. The 2-1 win is the first for new Hoffenheim coach Markus Babbel, who took over at Hoffenheim three weeks ago. The team's previous coach, Holger Stanislawski, was sackedafter Hoffenheim was eliminated from the German Cup. \"I'm glad we were able to give some gas after they tied it up and get rewarded for it,\" Babbel said after the match. \"But we need to get even tougher.\" Freiburg's freefall Freiburghad to be feeling pretty good about themselves after holding Bayern Munich to a 0-0 draw last weekend. But Stuttgart put an end to any positive momentum Freiburg may have hoped to carry forward, winning at home 4-1 against the Bundesliga's last place team. Stuttgart's Martin Harnik and Shinji Okazaki put the game out of reach for Freiburg in the first half, scoring in the 12th and 21st minutes. Freiburggot one back in the 27th on a goal from Fallou Diange, but that's all the offense they had in them for the day. Stuttgart's Khalid Boulahrouz added another goal in the 63rd minute, and Harnik adding the fourth and final nail in Freiburg's coffin in the 83rd minute. Gladbach slips On Friday, Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach dropped two points on home soil against mid-table Hamburg, drawing 1-1. Gladbach, surprise challengers for the title at present, did not look their best. The draw leaves coach Lucien Favre's \"Foals\" second in the Bundesliga standings, two points adrift of leaders Borussia Dortmund, although either Schalke or Bayern Munich could overtake them later this weekend. Hamburg, meanwhile, continue their respectable recovery after a woeful start to the season. The side, which has rebounded strongly under the stewardship of new coach Thorsten Fink, currently sits eighth in the table. Sunday double-whammy On Sunday, Champions and league-leaders Dortmund host Hannover, who are unbeaten for the calendar year, on Sunday evening. In arguably the pick of this weekend's matches, the earlier Sunday game will pit fourth-placed Bayern Munich against third-placed Schalke on Bavarian soil at the Allianz Arena. Either side could overtake Gladbach for second spot in the table after that game - but only with the three points secured from a win. Author: Matt Zuvela Editor: Darren Mara",

"story": "EU climate envoy welcomes Obama's carbon plan A senior EU figure on climate change has hailed US President Obama's plan to limit the country's carbon emissions. Obama's announcement came ahead of a global climate summit in Paris. In a series of statements on Twitter, the European Union's commissioner for climate action and energy, Miguel Arias Canete, praised the Clean Power Plan, which had been announced by US President Barack Obama on Monday. Canete (pictured) called the plan \"a positive step forward\" in efforts by the US - the world's second-biggest carbon polluter after China - to cut down on its emissions. UN leaders are due to gather in the French capital in four months time for a climate conference (COP21) with the aim of agreeing on measures to limit global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). The vast majority of scientists accept that climate change caused by human's creation of greenhouse gases is a grave threat to life on Earth. Obama's plan marked the first time power plants in the US have been targeted by mandatory regulations on carbon dioxide emissions. The measures force power plant owners to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 32 percent by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. \"We're the first generation to feel the impact of climate change and the last generation that can do something about it,\" Obama told a gathering of supporters at the White House. Member states of the European Union, which is the world's third largest carbon emitter, have already agreed to cut emissions by 40 percent from 1990 levels by the year 2030. se/sms (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

"story": "#Germany Decides - Election Road Trip What concerns German voters the most? This is what DW journalists Nina Haase-Trobridge and Sumi Somaskanda want to find out ahead of the nation\u2019s parliamentary elections. #Germany Decides - the banner under which a team of reporters from Deutsche Welle is driving across the republic this summer and before the country votes for a new parliament in autumn. The reportage aims to chart the country\u2019s mood and answer our international audience\u2019s question: \"What really concerns the German voter?\" September 24, 2017 sees elections to the 19th German Bundestag. Current incumbent Chancellor Angela Merkel is running for a fourth time, this year against the Social Democrats' candidate Martin Schulz. Many observers feel German society is becoming increasing polarized. Merkel's refugee policy has drawn sustained attack from the right. One party, the \"Alternative for Germany\" (AfD), has gained significant traction out of it\u2019s anti-islamist stance. Narrowly missing entry into the Bundestag in 2013, will it make it this time? DW journalists Sumi Somaskanda and Nina Haase-Trobridge set off on a journey across the republic. They go to Dresden, city of anti-immigrant rallies, to gauge the strength of right-wing populism. They move on through the Czech Republic to Wegscheid on the German-Austrian border, where thousands of refugees poured into Germany every day in the autumn of 2015. What\u2019s it like in the small border community now? The DW team meets Mayor Josef Lamperstorfer, who expressed his scorn for Germany\u2019s politicians in scathing a letter about the humanitarian disaster. How welcome are refugees now? How fairly are they treated in Germany? How stable will the German economy be in the future? Nina Haase-Trobridge and Sumi Somaskanda want to find out how the people of this Republic are getting on. They meet young right-wingers, managers, politicians as well as the politically disillusioned. They travel across Germany from Saxony to Bavaria, Baden-Wurttemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia and then back to Berlin via Bremen. Who is going to be running Germany later this year?

"story": "German Tobacco Farmers Face Gloomy Future Germany's tobacco growers are in crisis mode. With EU subsidies due to stop in 2009, it's predicted the crop will die out. And given the current anti-smoking climate, there's not a lot of sympathy for the farmers. Farmer Markus Fischer is the fourth generation in his family to grow tobacco, and he'll probably be the last. About a sixth of his 150-hectare (370-acre) farm in the southern Palatinate region of Germany is currently dedicated to tobacco, the farm's main source of income. But Fischer isn't sure what the future holds. Tobacco is a highly subsided crop in Europe. Farmers earn around 1.20 euros ($1.64) per kilo, and the EU pays about two euros per kilo on top of that. As part of the EU's agricultural shake-up, these subsidies will be completely phased out by the end of 2009, which will probably mean the end for Germany's 450 tobacco growers. \"We can't cover our overheads without the subsidies,\" Fischer said. \"For the amount we're currently getting from the buyers, we won't be able to keep to producing.\" Examining other options Like other farmers in the region, Markus Fischer and his family have already started looking into alternatives. They have expanded their asparagus crop and started growing strawberries, although they will receive much less for these products. They have also built holiday houses on their land with the aim of establishing a farm-stay business. Fischer, however, still \"hopes to keep growing tobacco,\" because that is what he knows best. Around 10,000 tons of Virginia, Burley and Geudertheimer tobacco are harvested in Germany, Europe's fifth biggest tobacco producer (Italy sits in the number one spot). Most of Germany's tobacco farmers are based in the southwestern regions of Baden and Palatinate along the sunny Rhine plain stretching from Basel to Mainz. More than 400 years of history Tobacco has a long tradition in the Palatinate. The first recorded mention of the plant goes back to 1573, when a priest started cultivating it as a medicinal herb. Now, approximately 1,200 hectares of tobacco are grown in the region -- a third of Germany's total acreage dedicated to the crop. The plant has left an indelible mark on the area. Not only is the countryside dotted with tobacco fields and drying sheds, there are also frescos on houses depicting the harvest, tobacco sculptures, tobacco fountains, a tobacco museum and even a tobacco cycle path. \"If tobacco disappears, as it probably will if the situation doesn't change, then we will also loose a part of our cultural tradition in the Palatinate,\" said J\u00fcrg B\u00e4hr, the head of the German Tobacco Grower's Association. The association is lobbying hard for an extension of the subsidies until 2013 so that the tobacco farmers have more time to convert to other crops. There's no chance of the EU changing its payments scheme though -- the subsidy cut was agreed and signed off on back in 2004. The only chance for more money is from the federal government, but the current political climate isn't exactly supportive of tobacco. Smoking bans Federal bans on smoking in public transport, taxis, airports and government offices came into power in Germany on Sept. 1, while in August, three states introduced anti-smoking laws in schools, hospitals and most types of restaurants and bars. The other states are expected to follow suit by the end of the year. \"We all know that smoking is bad for your health, and so of course politicians have a difficult time standing up for tobacco as a product, especially at the federal level,\" B\u00e4hr said. \"But just because the growers aren't there anymore doesn't mean people will smoke less.\" Europe already imports 95 percent of its tobacco from outside its borders. According to B\u00e4hr, when the European crop collapses, cigarette manufacturers will just import the extra 5 percent from elsewhere. \"Then people will be yelling again: 'The rain forest in Brazil is being felled for tobacco, we can't have that,' and 'children are being exploited in the fields working in Africa and India,'\" he said. \"We don't have any of that here in Germany.\"",

"story": "China criticizes EU solar dumping probe The EU has decided to investigate allegations that Chinese solar firms are dumping their wares in Europe. China has promptly articulated its opposition to the move. China expressed its \u201cdeep regret\u201d on Thursday over the European Commission's decision to look into allegations that Chinese producers are guilty of solar panel dumping. Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesman Shen Danyang passed comment after Brussels announced on Wednesday that the Commission would investigate the issue following complaints from European solar companies. \"China expresses deep regret\" about the move, Shen said in a statement published on the ministry's website. \"Restricting China's solar panel products will not only hurt the interests of both Chinese and European industry, it will also wreck the healthy development of the global solar and clean energy sector,\" said Shen, who called for negotiations to solve the dispute. A group of 25 European solar companies, including Germany's SolarWorld, first filed an anti-dumping complaint against China to the European Commission in July. They accuse their Chinese competitors, which receive subsidies worth billions from the Chinese government, of flooding the market with basement-price products. European solar companies are also heavily subsidized at home. Major Chinese companies in the solar panel industry, such as Yingli, Suntech, Trina and Canadian Solar had responded to the complaint by threatening a trade war. The conflict between the two sides was also a topic of conversation during German Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit to Beijing last week.

"story": "German Cup preview: Bayern set to beat Stuttgart Bayern Munich is set to crown a spectacular season by bagging a third title in addition to their Bundesliga and Champions League wins. They face Stuttgart in Berlin for the final of the German Cup. \"It is more than a trophy we can win. We can write history,\" said Bayern midfielder Thomas M\u00fcller. It's true: no German team has ever managed to win the Bundesliga, the German Cup and the Champions League in one season. Bayern are one win away from becoming the first. Bayern are going into the Cup final as the clear favorites, even though they have to do without their Brazilian defender Dante and midfielder Luis Gustavo, who have been called to play for their national team this week. But Stuttgart is not planning to let Bayern have free reign of the pitch. Coach Bruno Labbadia's team has played a disappointing season, ending up in twelfth place. But now they are set to clinch a Europa League spot simply by having reached the final. It has been 16 years since Stuttgart last won the German Cup, but coach Labbadia is optimistic. \"We have our own talents which we can use cleverly against Bayern,\" said the 47-year-old Labbadia, who has been on contract with Stuttgart since 2010 and has quite a bit to show for: He fought off relegation twice and managed to get Stuttgart into the Europa League for two seasons. Coaches eye the same prize As a player with Kaiserslautern, Labbadia won the German Cup in 1990, and as a coach with Leverkusen he reached the final in 2009 \u2013 and lost. In that respect he and Bayern's Jupp Heynckes are on the same level: Heynckes has also only won the Cup as a player \u2013 1973 with M\u00f6nchengladbach \u2013 but never as a coach. Both teams stand to gain financially. Champions League and Bundesliga winners Bayern Munich have already made 9 million euros (11.7 million) in marketing fees for the three live matches they have played this season in the Cup competition. Only one of Stuttgart's matches was broadcast live so far, but that still gave them 3,7 million euros. There is still more money to come from the marketing of TV rights, advertising, and last but not least, ticket sales. Both teams get a bonus of two million euros for having reached the final \u2013 and the winner receives 300,000 euros on top of that.",

"story": "A face with wrinkles and blemishes: the moon is aging with dignity The moon is more than 4 billion years old and people used to think there were large areas of water as well as lunar species. But there are no settlements yet and the moon's \"seas\" are bone dry. The Earth's satellite looks really old. It's turned completely grey and its face is marked with numerous wrinkles, stains and scars. It's visible: it's been through a lot in its lifespan. But given it's been around for some 4 and a half billion years, the moon has aged with dignity. Getting a facelift is out of the question. And it's not even necessary \u2013 as every four weeks during the new moon phase, the moon is veiled in darkness and can't be spotted from earth. We can see many big dark and lighter areas on the face of the moon. This is due to the varied landscape on its surface. Some people see a face up there, others claim the pattern looks like a hopping rabbit. At the time of astronomer Galileo Galilei, the first observers looking through their telescopes euphorically baptized the dark spots \"maria\" - the Latin word for the seas. They imagined huge bodies of water sloshing about what poets called the \"watery planet\", and they imagined a very special lunar species living on the moon. All that has become legend, and although astronomers still talk about \"maria\", it's quite clear that the moon is dry as a desert. Just like an old bookshelf, the moon is covered in thick dust. Today, it has completely congealed. However our celestial companion looks back at a very turbulent past. In the first billion years of its existence, just like Earth, it was exposed to a tremendous bombardment. Leftover debris from planet formation was abundant, and huge meteorites and whole asteroids were colliding with the surface. Even today, the numerous craters on the moon bear witness to the dramatic impact. The biggest craters gradually filled up with liquid lava and welled up from what then was the hot liquid core of the moon. So the dark spots on the moon are actually due to volcanic activity. And the maria of the moon probably came about roughly 3 billion years ago. That's when the worst bombardment with space debris was over, which is why there are relatively few craters in the maria. The lighter-coloured regions of the moon are called \"terrae\", or more commonly just highlands, since they are higher than most maria. The soil samples collected by the Apollo space missions are evidence that once upon a time there was indeed volcanic activity on the moon. It's still unclear though how the lava reached the surface of the moon. Possibly it came up through cracks created by the impact of meteorites in the craters. Even the first scientists observing the moon have come up with colorful names for the maria, full of longing for the supposedly paradisiacal conditions on the moon: there are for instance, a sea of mirth, of nectar, of crisis, of clouds and also a 'mare fecunditiatis', or the sea of fertility. However, the most well-known dark spot in the near side of the moon \u2013 the right eye in the moon's face \u2013 is called mare tranquilitatis, or the sea of tranquillity. That name is an obvious misconception because four and a half million years later the lunar peace has well and truly been disturbed. On July 21, 1969, Neil Armstrong took his famous first step on the moon right in the sea of tranquillity. Author: Dirk H.Lorezen (ara) Editor: Neil King",

"story": "Romania's shaky coalition government collapses Romania's center-left coalition government has collapsed after a group of Social Democrat ministers resigned in protest over the firing of the country's interior minister. After months of an uneasy cohabitation with its centrist Liberal Democrat (PDL) partners, left-leaning Social Democratic Party (PSD) leader Mircea Geoana said on Thursday that nine ministers from his party had quit the government \"in solidarity\" with Interior Minister, Dan Nica. The move ends the shaky nine-month tenure of a coalition consumed by bickering and corruption allegations just before presidential elections scheduled for November 22. Nica was fired by Prime Minister Emil Boc on Monday over comments he made about potential fraud in the run-up to the November poll. Nica's comments were widely interpreted as an accusation that Boc's Liberal Democrats might try to cheat to get President Traian Basescu re-elected. As an interim solution, Nica was replaced by Development Minister Vasile Blaga, who is the PDL campaign chief and a close ally of Basescu. Geoana has blamed the president for the crisis, saying \"nothing was sacred\" to him to ensure he wins another term in office. Coalition had a whole laundry list of problems Divisions between the PDL and PSD have festered since the beginning of the year after the Social Democrats accused President Basescu of interfering in the government decision-making process. Also in January, the PSD's interior minister, Gabriel Oprea, resigned in a dispute over the appointment of an intelligence officer considered too close to the coalition partners. In February, the newly appointed Liviu Dragnea quit the same post, citing insufficient funds allocated to his ministry. In September, Prime Minister Boc threatened to fire the leftist education minister unless she withdrew a controversial decision to allow political appointments in the education sector. Boc said the decision contradicted principles of newly adopted IMF-mandated legislation to reform the country's ailing education system. At the same time, the Social Democrats slammed massive job cuts planned by the government as part of a 20-billion-euro ($29 billion) IMF aid package, saying it would oppose the implementation of such a move. PSD support for parliamentary inquiries investigating PDL ministers Monica Iacob-Ridzi for fraud and Elena Udrea for abuse of power prompted the centrists to ask the PSD whether they wanted to be in government or in the opposition. As it stands now, with the presidential election in November, voters will have the option of sending a signal on which party should do what. gb/dpa/AFP/Reuters/AP Editor: Michael Lawton",

"story": "Norwegian pension fund to divest from coal The Norwegian parliament has decided to pull out of investments in the coal sector. Environmental campaigners say this will have a major impact, but still seek closure of potential loopholes. The Norwegian parliament's finance committee announced on Thursday that it intends to divest the country's sovereign wealth fund from the coal industry. Environmental groups have welcomed the Norwegian parliament's decision, saying it shows how lawmakers have responded to public pressure in the global fight against climate change. \"This is very important and will send a very strong signal to coal burning and mining companies all over the world,\" Truls Gulowsen, head of Greenpeace Norway told DW. \"The fund is one of the world's top 10 largest investors in the global coal industry, so this will have a real impact.\" Greenpeace estimates that new regulations would result in around $5 billion (4.6 billion euros) being pulled out of the coal sector. The move has cross-party support, and parliament is set to confirm the decision June 5. \"This is a clear signal to those who use coal that they have to look at other forms of energy,\" Hans Olav Syversen of the Christian Democrats told public broadcaster NRK. The 900 billion euro fund will no longer invest in firms where coal-fired energy accounts for 30 percent or more of their turnover or profit. \"The 30 percent level is a practical and sound approach that others around the world will be able to follow,\" Gulowsen said. Earlier this week, environmental groups delivered a petition with 44,000 signatures urging the Norwegian government to divest from fossil fuels. A recent report co-authored by Greenpeace said that previous moves to withdraw some of the sovereign wealth fund's investment from fossil fuel industry were inadequate, calling them \"pretend divestment.\" Gulowsen told DW that politicians had responded to those criticisms, and that the new decision represented a major step forward. However, he added that Greenpeace and others were calling for a second criteria for divestment, by volume of coal - saying that the fund would still invest in the world's three largest private coal-mining firms. Each of these extracts more than 100 million tons of coal annually, because they are also involved in other mining activities. \"We hope that these miners will also be excluded down the line,\" Gulowsen said. Activists say the global campaign to divest from fossil fuels is gaining momentum, with ever more pension funds, charities, faith groups and universities pulling out of companies that contribute to carbon emissions.",

"story": "How deep is the split in Turkish society? For weeks, Turks have been protesting against Prime Minister Erdogan's government - though apparently with modest success. A group of Turkish experts has taken a look at different social divisions in Turkish society. Lale Akg\u00fcn is adamant: \"The protests won't stop. The genie is out of the bottle.\" The German Social Democratic politician adds that people are bound to demonstrate and offer resistance until the present liberal spirit is established in society. Akg\u00fcn was one of a group of experts in a panel discussion organized in Bonn earlier this week by DW, the Southeast Europe Association and the German-Turkish Association on the causes and consequences of the protests in Turkey. The other panel members: Turkish-born journalist Canan Topcu, Bahaedin G\u00fcng\u00f6r, the head of DW's Turkish Service, and Maurus Reinkowski, a scholar of Islam at the University of Basel in Switzerland. \"Everyone opposed to Erdogan's authoritarian style of government has taken to the streets - you see housewives with their daughters, young couples, young and old people, soccer fans and transsexuals,\" said Akg\u00fcn, who recently returned from a visit to Turkey. \"That's something Turkey is experiencing for the first time: a pluralistic society where you can live and let live.\" Erdogan's rise to power The protests in the streets do not appear to faze Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however. But how could a man who ignores the wishes of a good part of the population have risen to power more than 10 years ago? \"Erdogan is the result of a fragmentation of the established parties at that time. They were totally embroiled in power struggles,\" G\u00fcng\u00f6r remembered. \"No one wanted to give in.\" These parties clearly neglected to fulfill the people's expectations, he said - and that's when Erdogan stepped in, telling voters they had tried out the established parties, and now they should give him a chance. \"That was the secret of his success. Erdogan benefitted from a lack of political opponents.\" The situation has changed. Today, Erdogan has quite a few opponents among the population and the opposition - and even faces criticism from within the ranks of his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and Turkish President Abdullah Gul. In just 10 days, the police managed to destroy the reputation Turkey worked hard to attain, said Akg\u00fcn, and she predicts further resistance. \"If the AKP breaks apart, that could spell a quick end to Erdogan,\" she said. An acquired taste According to Akg\u00fcn, the protests produced a phenomenon entirely new to Turkish society: previously apolitical youth have become politicized. \"The young people are acquiring a taste for politics,\" said Akg\u00fcn, adding that politics means shaping society, but it also means having a desire for power. \"These young people now must let their enthusiasm and energy flow into creating political structures that will allow them to strive for political power - with the legitimization to rule and shape.\" The demonstrations raised the question of the deep split in Turkish society, which includes groups as different as the Alevites, Secularists and Kemalists. Reinkowski dismisses such categorizations as \"too narrow,\" pointing out Turkey presents \"a relatively lively picture, with quite some differentiation along the edges.\" He said the Taksim movement shows how a common concern can bring together different currents, a factor that should not be underestimated. Turkish civilian society is marked by greater self-confidence and a conviction that political action can bring about change, said Reinkowski - \"a cultural and even political capital that will take hold over the coming years.\" Solidarity - a touchy subject The anti-Erdogan protests in Turkey have also spread to and mobilized people in Germany. But the protesters are quite different, as Topcu pointed out: in Germany, they were more fragmented, sometimes demonstrators refused to join a protest with, for instance, Kemalists. \"It is different in Turkey,\" she said.\" People with a reason to be dissatisfied managed to come together to demonstrate against the AKP government and Erdogan. That is not how it was in Germany.\" The journalist fears the rallies in German cities could taint the way Turkish migrants are perceived. \"I don't think the mass demonstration by the Alevite community or the protests organized by pro-Erdogan groups contribute to improving the image of ethnic Turks living in Germany, because the protests indicate that people are much more strongly attached to their native country than to Germany.\" That is not bound to be well-received by critics who regard Muslims as shirking integration, Topcu added. Difficult path to the EU Germany's perception plays a crucial role in an issue close to the Turkish heart: accession to the EU. Chancellor Angela Merkel urges continuing accession talks despite violent police intervention in the Turkish protests. But G\u00fcng\u00f6r is convinced: \"Turkey is unmanageable.\" It is not comparable with Romania, Bulgaria or other EU countries beset by major problems. \"Those problems are manageable, and everything is transparent.\" In addition, said G\u00fcng\u00f6r, Turkey is in a difficult situation with regard to its neighbors Syria, Iraq and Iran - \"the restless Caucasus.\" From an economic, social and foreign policy point of view, G\u00fcng\u00f6r concluded, Turkey is not an easy country: \"It will be very difficult to see Turkey in the EU at all.\"",

Germany's two-time Formula One champion Sebastisn Vettel was awarded the Silver Laurel Leaf on Friday, Germany's highest honor for sporting achievement. The award was given by Germany's acting president, Horst Seehofer, at a ceremony at the presidential palace Bellevue in Berlin. \"Despite all the top places and trophies,\" Seehofer told Vettel,\" you've remained down to earth and modest, and millions of fans appreciate that in you.\" Vettel flew to Berlin from Formula One time trials in Barcelona to accept the award. \"I like collecting trophies,\" he said \"but this honor is very special, because you'll maybe only get it once in your lifetime.\" Vettel had last season's driver's title wrapped up with three races to go and will have no shortage of drivers chasing after him and his Red Bull car this season. In 2010, he became the youngest driver's champion ever. Seven-time Formula One champion Michael Schumacher is the only other driver to receive the Silver Laurel Leaf. mz/rg (dpa, AP)",

"story": "Poland and Industry 4.0 in the spotlight of Hanover industry fair German chancellor Angela Merkel has opened the world's biggest industrial fair. Poland is the partner nation of the fair that also seeks to allay fears from technological advances associated with Industry 4.0. During he traditional opening walk around the Hannover Messe fairground, the German chancellor made a plea for free and open trade, saying isolationism and protectionism would only lead to losses for society as a whole. In Hanover this year, Poland's industry is at the center of the fair. The five-day trade fair, which is in its 70th year, also focuses on networked industry, with robots playing an increasing role in the approximately 6,500 exhibitions from more than 70 countries. Poland is Germany's eighth most lucrative trading partner with a population of 38 million. Last year, German mechanical engineering companies exported assets worth 5.7 billion euros ($6.1 billion) across the border to Poland. The Mechanical Engineering Industry Association's (VDMA) Eastern Europe expert, Yvonne Heidler, says the plan is for growth in 2017. \"Poland is coming, and we are assuming that Poland will become an increasingly important trade partner,\" said Carl Martin Welcker, the president of the VDMA in an interview with Reuters. The focus of this year's fair is Industry 4.0, which exchanges data on manufacturing techologies over cloud computing, energy transformation and automation of labor. Poland is one of the fastest growing markets for automation in manufacturing, but there's still room for industry to improve its competitiveness. \"Many companies are still at the level of Industry 2.0, with only 15 percent of the factories fully automated, 76 percent partly automated, and the rest still being handled by hand,\" explained Heidler. Robots and humans can coexist Amid tensions on factory floors over the risk of losing jobs to robots, the Hannover Messe will attempt to alleviate concerns. Exhibitors will demonstrate how machines can coexist alongside human workers and offer support in factories. Although job changes are inevitable, robots can adapt to the speed and behavioral changes of humans, said trade fair boss Jochen Koeckler. \"Robots learn from robots,\" said Koeckler. \"But it is human beings who tell the robot what tasks need to be done.\" To adapt from manual jobs to commanding robots will demand higher qualifications and greater expertise of technology and programming explained Stefan Assmann, head of Bosch's connected industry unit. There is no need for fewer workers at the automotive supplier company. More than 1,700 panels will take place at the Hannover Messe with 6,500 exhibitors and a further 1,200 journalists from around the globe. uhe/rd (Reuters, dpa)",

"story": "German youth ditch enviro interests for economic woes Germany's position as an eco-pioneer could be under threat. A new government survey has found that the country's current generation of 14- to 25-year-olds are less worried about the environment than their elders were. Young Germans are losing interest in environmental issues as they fear for their economic security, according to a government study released on Tuesday. Good living standards and opportunities for self-development are more important to young people than sustainable ecology, according to a report produced by the UBA, Germany's main environmental protection agency, in collobaration with the Environment Ministry. Only 21 percent of 14- to 25-year-olds consider an \"intact environment\" or the \"chance to enjoy nature\" important to living a good life, according to the study, which was based on a survey and focus group interviews. More important factors for a good life include belonging to a family or a community (71 percent), a high standard of living (48 percent) and having the chance to express oneself (39 percent). \"Young people are interested in the environment and do consider an intact nature also important for a good life, but not to the same extent as older people,\" UBA President Maria Krautzberger said, suggesting that branded clothing and electronic products are of more interest to young people. Apathy mixed with worry Despite the newfound eco-apathy, young people's lifestyles are more likely to be environmentally friendly than older people's - whether by accident or design. \"They move around the city and the country in an intelligent way,\" said Krautzberger. \"They use the bike, bus and train, or go on foot; cars don't play nearly as big a role as for adults.\" \"Of course the environment is very important, and I agree that we should try to preserve it, but the fact is that it isn't the highest priority for a lot of people,\" one 15-year-old told the researchers. \"I think it's somehow natural that things like happiness and health for example are more important than some aspects of the environment.\" Though young people rank the environment as low on their list of priorities, it seems that they are aware that the environment is in a bad state - particularly in the rest of the world. Some 94 percent of young people said that the state of the environment worldwide was either \"bad\" or \"very bad,\" while only 30 percent said this of the environment in Germany. Young people are also aware that the lifestyles of people in industrialized nations have an effect on the environment in the rest of the world: Some 84 percent said that high-consumption lifestyles such as those enjoyed in many European countries are at least partly responsible for environmental problems in poorer nations. This appears to have given many a pessimistic outlook. \"It'll probably become more negative in the future,\" one 16-year-old told the study. \"It's true that humanity is getting more conscious of the fact that it's getting worse, and is always looking for alternatives, for example to fossil fuels. But it'll always be a fifty-fifty situation, because something will make it worse, and something else will come along that will make it a bit better, but then it'll get worse again.\" \"I'm aware that my prosperity is based on the exploitation of the environment or the exploitation of other people,\" a respondent said. Economic anxiety Anxiety about the future economy clearly weighs heavier on the minds of young Germans than ecology - and apparently there is also an increased awareness of market pressures. \"The environment and nature do not play a significant role in young people's everyday lives,\" the study concluded. \"Increased pressure to perform, educational pressure and uncertain career perspectives are more pressing challenges.\" But, balanced with worries about prosperity, there was also a concern about the environmental impact of continual economic growth. A majority (69 percent) agreed with the statement, \"When I see that our economy continuing to grow year by year, I wonder: how long can that go well?\" But at the same time, nearly half - 49 percent - also believed that economic growth would actually be necessary to combating climate change. In other words, the study found that young German are stuck between twin anxieties. \"Young people are caught in a dilemma between skepticism toward economic growth and concerns about prosperity,\" the study concluded. \"They display an average level of skepticism toward growth combined with greater-than-average concerns about prosperity. In addition, among young people there is a widespread conviction that ecological and social challenges can only be overcome with growth and prosperity.\"",

"story": "UK economy picks up speed Britain's economy gathered momentum in the second quarter, fresh figures from the Office for National Statistics have revealed. But pundits believe further economic expansion could be marred by the Brexit vote. The UK economy picked up during the second quarter that concluded with the nation's vote to leave the European Union. Q2 gross domestic product grew by 0.6 percent, up from 0.4 percent in the first three months of the year. Output in the three months to June was 2.2 percent higher than a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported Wednesday. Crystal ball reading? But economists warned that this robust pace of growth might not last into the second half of the year, given the uncertainties over the medium and long-term impact of the country's pro-Brexit vote in the June 23 referendum. Recent data show unease across British factories, with confidence among UK manufacturers falling in July to its lowest level since early 2009. While consumer optimism tumbled in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, some private sector surveys suggest domestic demand has mostly held up, helped by a strong labor market. But the Confederation of British Industry reported Wednesday that retailers suffered the sharpest drop in sales in four years following the referendum. Orders placed with suppliers fell at the sharpest rate since March 2009 and were expected to decline rapidly in August too. hg/jd (Reuters, AFP)",

"story": "Latest Ebola outbreak in DR Congo poses high regional risk, says WHO The WHO said the presence of armed groups and the broad spread of the disease, could make vaccination \"near impossible\" in North Kivu. It's the 10th outbreak in DRC since Ebola was discovered. The organization's emergency response chief, Peter Salama, expressed concern about the regional risks this outbreak could pose \u2014 given the pattern of its spread and its closeness to international frontiers. \"It would appear that the risk, as we can surmise for DRC, is high. For the region it's high given the proximity to borders, particularly Uganda,\" Salama said. Over a dozen WHO officials have been sent to North Kivu to help contain the disease. The Democratic Republic of Congo's health ministry said on Thursday that the Ebola variant in the most recent outbreak in North Kivu province had been identified as the Zaire strain. The North Kivu outbreak comes just over a week after Congo had declared the end of an outbreak in the northwest of the country that began in May, and in which 33 people died. The World Health Organization (WHO) has dispelled the notion that the two outbreaks are linked. In this week's Ebola outbreak, four cases have been registered in and around the town of Mangina, which has a population of 60,000 and is located near the border with Uganda. Two of those cases were confirmed to be health workers. An additional 20 people have died in the area since July, as a result of hemorrhagic fevers that have not been identified as Ebola. Read more: Ebola outbreak in DRC: What is being done? Vaccine available The outbreak in northwestern Congo also belonged to the Zaire strain and an experimental vaccine from pharmaceutical company Merck was used to fight its spread. That vaccine was given to contacts of Ebola patients and contacts of contacts, in an effort to ringfence the disease. For ring-vaccination to be effective, health workers must reach all those potentially infected with the deadly virus. This may be difficult to do in northeastern Congo, as the WHO estimates that the outbreak could spread over tens of kilometers. North Kivu a conflict zone Additionally, Salama noted that approximately 100 armed groups operate in North Kivu and this could make ring-vaccination impossible. Instead, WHO workers might consider \"a more homogenous geographical strategy\", he said, where security concerns are assessed on a day-to-day-basis. Staff would be based in the larger city of Goma. Since armored personnel carriers and support from UN peacekeepers would be needed to work in North Kivu, this could make it very difficult to deploy the kind of far-reaching contact tracing required. WHO has already dealt with an outbreak in this area, around a decade ago. \"We had to negotiate with many armed factions,\" Salama said, in order to provide the badly needed aid. Read more: Top ten most dangerous viruses in the world The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies echoed the WHO's concerns, saying that responding to a new Ebola outbreak in North Kivu would be \"highly complex,\" due to the security situation. The Ebola virus is can be transported long distances by bats, who are carriers of the virues, and tend to find its way into bush meat sold at local markets. In humans, the deadly virus spreads through contact with bodily fluids and once infected, it causes hemorrhagic fever, vomiting and diarrhea and is spread through direct contact with body fluids. Over 11,300 people died of an epidemic in West Africa from 2013 to 2016. jcg/rc (Reuters, AFP) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.

"story": "EU appeals to members for more assets for Frontex Frontex says Greece and Hungary are buckling under an unprecedented influx of migrants. The EU's border agency wants nations to commit more vehicles and personnel. The European Union made a fresh appeal Friday for member states to provide aircraft and other assets so that Frontex, the EU's border agency, can help states like Greece and Hungary cope with a fresh wave of migrants. A record 49,550 migrants tried to reach the European Union through Greece alone last month, more than had been recorded for all of 2014, Frontex said. According to the International Organization for Migration, more than 192,000 migrants have arrived in Europe by sea this year already. Over 2,000 migrants are believed to have died attempting the perilous Mediterranean crossing. \"Because of the short distance between Turkey and the Greek islands, the smugglers cram migrants onto small boats,\" Frontex said in a statement. \"As a result, border guards must deal with a large number of incidents.\" About 90 percent of the new arrivals are escaping Syria and Afghanistan, the agency said, while the remaining come from other conflict zones or are economic migrants. Many countries have already pledged to provide assets for short-term use, but Frontex spokeswoman Natasha Bertaud said more planes and \"technical assistance\" including personnel and patrol cars were necessary. Hungary's wall with Serbia Hungary is also facing a crisis as it has received an unprecedented 110,000 migrants this year, nearly all walking from neighboring Serbia. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced that a 4-meter (13-foot) high fence, currently under construction by the Hungarian military, would be in place by the end of the month. But Roberta Metsola, a leading European parliamentarian from Malta, called for \"a seismic shift\" in EU thinking in dealing with the influx. \"We cannot let history judge us as the generation who stood by and talked while people died,\" she said. Meanwhile, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras asked Europe to help as his heavily indebted country could not deal with them alone. \"The EU is being tested on the issue of Greece. It has responded negatively on the economic front - that's my view. I hope it will respond positively on the humanitarian front,\" he said Friday. UNHCR calls situation 'shameful' The Greek premier's comments came as the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) called on Greece to take control of the \"total chaos\" on Mediterranean islands, where thousands of migrants have landed. \"The level of suffering we have seen on the islands is unbearable. People arrive thinking they are in the European Union. What we have seen was not anything acceptable in terms of standards of treatment,\" Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR director for Europe said after visiting the Greek islands of Lesbos, Kos and Chios. \"I have never seen a situation like that.

"story": "Long necks, fat bellies, shrill colors: How Florence's 16th-century artists saw people We might not consider them beautiful, but Florence's Mannerism portraits were groundbreaking in art history. Some are being shown in Germany for the first time, at the St\u00e4del Museum in Frankfurt. \"Elegant, cultivated, artificial,\" is how curator Bastian Eclercy describes the style of a new generation of Florentine Mannerism artists in the early 16th century. They wanted to set themselves apart from the grand masters of the Renaissance, such as Leonardo, Michelangelo or Raffael. Shrill colors, disproportionate limbs, unusual forms and perspectives were the trademark of art works during this era. Bastian Eclercy calls them \"capricious and extravagant, at times bizarre.\" Numerous significant paintings, designs and sculptures of this era form part of the exhibition \"Maniera. Pontormo, Bronzino and the Florence of the Medici,\" curated by Bastian Eclercy in Frankfurt's St\u00e4del Museum. Bronzino's painting \"Portrait of a Lady in Red\" is both starting point and center piece of the exhibition. It's not only one of the most valuable works of art in the museum's possession , but also one of the key works of Florentine portrait painting. The portrait featuring a lady clad in a red dress and holding a small dog on her lap appears sublime and lofty. She looks down at her admirers with an aloof expression on her noble face - an effect purposefully created by Bronzino, the court painter of the Medici. Art on loan from all over the world Painters such as Rosso Fiorentino were more daring in the way in which they dealt with classical motives than, for example, Renaissance painter Raffael. That difference in approach becomes clearly discernible in the exhibition. Whereas Raffael created his work \"Madonna Esterh\u00e1zy\" (ca. 1507/08) with soft colors and a well organized and simple structure, Fiorentino's portrait of the Madonna, the child and John (ca. 1515) is more dynamic and cheeky: The facial traits of the two boys are almost reminiscent of a caricature, and the Madonna's transparent dress allows the beholder to sneak a peek at her breasts and belly button. The St\u00e4del Museum shows a total of 120 works from museums from all over the world, among them the Paris Louvre, New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and the State Gallery in Stuttgart, with the aim of presenting the entire range of stylistic variety and the particular obstinacy of Florentine artists. Many of these impressive art works originate in Florence, the center of Mannerism. Jacopo Pontormo's \"Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand,\" which depicts human suffering in a very physical way, is a loan item from the Galleria Palatina. The portrait of \"The Duke Alessandro de' Medici\" by Giorgio Vasari, featuring the Florentine sovereign in a suit of armor, is part of the collection of the world-famous Uffizi Gallery in Florence. Medicis - obsessed with power and fond of culture In the exhibition, the paintings are presented in eight different parts, thus reflecting different chapters in the rich history of the city, while throwing light on the immense influence of the powerful Medici family on the world of art. Another central theme is also the widespread political unrest of the era, including the conquest of Rome by Charles V and the temporary expulsion of the Medici from Florence. Apart from paintings, designs and sculptures, curator Eclercy also made an effort to include architectural aspects of Mannerism in his exhibition. For that purpose, the St\u00e4del Museum constructed a copy of the vestibule of the Biblioteca Laurenziana with Michelangelo's famous staircase in a proportion of 1:3. That masterwork had once been commissioned by the Medici Pope Clement VII. How Mannerism got its name Giorgio Vassari was not only a blessed artist and the court painter of the Medicis, but has also gained particular significance for the study of art. That's why a whole chapter has been dedicated to him in the exhibition. The second edition of his main work \"Le Vite de' pi\u00f9 eccellenti pittori, scultori, ed architettori\" (The Lives of the most Eminent Painters, Sculptors and Architects),written in 1568, has remained the first systematic description of art history which also contains the first theoretical debates on Mannerism. And Vassari also served as the eponym of this art style: \"Maniera\" (Italian for Mannerism), which is derived from \"mano\" (hand), means \"way\" or \"fashion,\" and describes the individual style of the Mannerists. The exhibition \"Maniera. Pontormo, Bronzino and the Florence of the Medici\" is shown in Frankfurt's St\u00e4del Museum from February 24 through June 5, 2016.",

"story": "Debate over German defense budget surfaces Increased defense spending budgeted by the German cabinet for 2017 has already been called into question. It won't even keep the army functional, according to a Defense Ministry paper quoted by the newspaper \"Bild.\" Germany's defense sector on Saturday sought a bigger share of Germany's federal budget for election year 2017 as debate surfaced ahead of parliament's final expenditure approvals in November. Defense ministry budget experts had concluded that an extra 1.7 billion euros earmarked for the Bundeswehr was insufficient to keep existing services functional, let alone enable investments in new equipment, said the tabloid \"Bild.\" In late March, Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet adopted the cornerstones of a 325-billion-euro federal budget for 2017, with 36.6 billion euros planned for defense and more than half overall - 171 billion euros - set aside for social welfare. \"Bild,\" quoting the internal defense paper, said the Bundeswehr would be left unable to purchase additional Leopard 2 battle tanks and would have to do without a new air defense system, known by its acronym as TLVS. The reaction to those claims within government circles had been that defense funding would be \"needs-oriented,\" Bild added, referring to longstanding warnings about Bundeswehr readiness. By 2020, defense spending would be 10.2 billion euros higher, a defense ministry spokesman told the French news agency AFP, adding, however, that such increases needed to be sustained in the long term. Two percent of GDP NATO allies, reacting to Russia's actions in Ukraine, agreed at their summit in Wales in 2014 to halt defense budget cuts and spend two percent of each nation's gross domestic product (GDP) on their militaries. \"Bild,\" again quoting the confidential paper as well as the DBwV association, which represents soldiers, said Germany would remain below that two-percent commitment. The Munich-based news magazine \"Focus\" said German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen had rejected calls for a return to military conscription, which Germany adopted in 1956 and dropped in 2011. The Bundeswehr, currently at 177,000 soldiers plus some 87,000 civilians, needed more personnel, \"but primarily highly motivated and qualified specialists,\" she said, adding that recruits whose \"hearts were not in it\" were of little help. The more effective recruitment approach was to show that the Bundeswehr was an \"attractive and modern employer,\" von der Leyen said, referring to her ministry's plan to recruit 14,300 extra soldiers and 4,400 civilians over the next seven years. Recruits sought for new cyber unit Alongside the Bundeswehr's five sections - ground forces, air force, navy, logistics and medical service - Germany is now recruiting personnel for its new cyber defense division. In 1990, at the time of German reunification and shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Bundeswehr had 585,000 troops - combining personnel of the former West Germany and the former communist East Germany. ipj/bw (dpa, AFP, Reuters)",

"story": "IMF was target of major cyber attack, report says The FBI has launched an investigation into reports the IMF was the target of a significant cyber attack. The dimensions of the attack on the global financial institution is still unknown, the New York Times has reported. Reports emerged on Sunday that the International Monetary fund has become the latest known victim of a significant cyber attack. The New York Times reported that the alarm was raised after what one official described as a \"very major breach.\" Intruders are believed to have attempted to install software which would give a nation state \"digital insider presence,\" in a \"targeted attack,\" a cyber-security expert who has worked for both the IMF and the World Bank said. The IMF declined to reveal the scope and nature of the intrusion, but David Hawley, a spokesman of the fund, told the New York Times that the institution is now \"fully functional.\" \"I can confirm that we are investigating an incident,\" he added. Political dynamite The IMF manages financial crises around the world and is home to highly sensitive information about economic conditions in many nations, including those on the verge of fiscal collapse. The fund has recently been central to economic bailout programs for Portugal, Ireland and Greece. Confidential information concerning the terms of economic bailouts were described by one fund official as \"political dynamite in many countries.\" Reports suggest that the IMF's sister institution, the World Bank, was so concerned they cut the computer link which allowed the agencies to share non-public information. The decision was taken out of an \"abundance of caution,\" a World Bank spokesman said, even though the information shared over the link was \"non-sensitive.\" The World Bank has now also resumed all normal operations. Custom code The attack, which is thought to have taken place over several months, is the latest in a series of high-profile computer break-ins. In this case, cyber intelligence expert Tom Kellerman, who works for both the IMF and the World Bank, said the nature of the code used suggests that it was developed specifically for the attack. The list of recent attacks on companies and institutions include Lockheed Martin Corp, Sony Corp and Citigroup Inc. Experts say cyber threats are increasing worldwide. CIA Director Leon articulated concerns this week over the \"real possibility\" of an attack by hackers that could be crippling. The origin of the IMF attack is unknown, but according to a US Defense Department spokeswoman, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation has been brought on board the investigation. Suspicious file transfers The IMF board of directors were first told of the attack on Wednesday, the New York Times reported, and a memo was issued warning employees to be on their guard. \"Last week we detected some suspicious file transfers, and the subsequent investigation established that a Fund desktop computer had been compromised and used to access some Fund systems,\" said a June 8 e-mail to employees from Chief Information Officer Jonathan Palmer. The attack is thought to have taken place before former head, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, was arrested last month on charges of sexually assaulting a maid in a New York Hotel. The IMF is currently searching for a new leader following Strauss-Kahn's resignation. Author: Charlotte Chelsom-Pill (Reuters, dpa) Editor: Kyle James",

"story": "EU Commission caves in to Germany on coal subsidy deadline The European Commission has caved in to German pressure over a 2014 deadline for subsidies for failing coal mines. The Commission said Wednesday it would delay the cancellation of subsidies until 2018. Germany has won concessions from the European Union on coal subsidies paid out to loss-making mines. The EU Commission said Wednesday it would push back a phase-out date on subsidies by four years to 2018. The Commission had said in July that failing mines would have to be closed by 2014, arguing that subsidies were bad for the environment and promoted unfair competition. But Germany fiercely protested, saying that the subsidies kept its coal industry afloat, and that a 2014 phase-out would endanger too many jobs. Job security for some 25,000 workers employed at five mines around Germany would have been threatened by a 2014 deadline. Berlin welcomed the Commission's decision as \"a great success,\" government spokesman Steffen Seibert said Wednesday. The extension of coal subsidies to 2018 would enable Germany to meet its social obligations to the country's miners, he added. The premier of Germany's Saarland state, which is home to one of the country's largest mines, welcomed the EU decision to yield to German pressure. Peter Mueller said the continuation of subsidies until 2018 was a \"socially acceptable solution for miners without redundancy deals.\" The four-year moratorium on mine closures should also be long enough to allow Germany to restructure its coal industry without sustaining considerable losses. Of the 26 other EU member states, only Romania and Spain will be directly affected by the new subsidies deadline. The deal is to set to be endorsed by EU competition ministers on Friday. Environmental group Greenpeace's energy policy expert, Frauke Thies, said that in 2008 the German government had subsidized each individual job in unprofitable coal mines to the tune of 235,000 euros ($311,000).

"story": "Floods hit Germany at economic low point As Germany battles severe flooding in parts of the country, the cost of the damage is hitting Europe's biggest economy just as it has barely overcome a harsh winter that has driven it to the brink of recession. In the first quarter of 2013, German Gross Domestic Product grew by just 0.1 percent. The country just managed to avoid a recession, which is defined as two successive quarters of economic contraction. Much of the hope for economic recovery lies with key economic indicators which predict accelerating growth in the coming months. However, economists are becoming more and more skeptical about the country's growth outlook as they fear that the much-vaunted spring upswing might drown in the deluge. \"As the flood levels rose, so did the problems for German businesses,\" says Alexander Schumann, chief economist at the German chambers for Industry and Commerce (DIHK). He told DW that it was especially the construction industry which had been unable to boost activity due to the heavy rainfall. The sector was particularly hard hit, as it was already facing a huge backlog of orders stemming from the long and harsh winter in Germany. But hotel and restaurant owners were also affected, suffering losses from the bad weather at the start of the tourist season in Germany - as were farmers offering seasonal products such as strawberries and asparagus. Disrupted supply chains Individual companies had their own stories to tell: Krones, global market leader in manufacturing bottling machines, had to shut down production in two plants in upper Bavaria. The region is among those severest hit by the floods, and Krones workers were unable to get to work on inundated roads. In Zwickau, Volkswagen (VW) had to stop its auto production, VW Saxony spokesman Gunter Sandmann told DW, and Monday's early shift was asked to stay at home. \"We were unsure whether the damage done to the transport infrastructure would enable suppliers to deliver their products in time, he added. Volkswagen has been able to resume production, prompting Sandmann to speak of a lucky escape. The same is true for the chemical companies located in the Bitterfeld chemical triangle, where the German armed forces were able to protect production facilities from the raging floods. Insurance industry officials said they were still unable to put a price tag on the losses caused by the flooding in eastern and southern Germany. However, the total of damage claims in the wake of the last so-called Flood of the Century in Germany in 2002 had amounted to 1.8 billion euros ($2.35 billion), Kathrin Jarosch from the GDV insurance industry lobby group says: \"We'll have figures this time at the earliest at the end of next week.\" Destruction to spur growth? Some small comfort is offered by the fact that catastrophes like these usually provide a small boost to the economy as a whole. Not only insurance companies will benefit from brisk new business, but do-it-yourself stores and home improvement suppliers, which had been complaining that garden furniture and barbecue grills were not finding any buyers, will now enjoy a run on tools and building materials. However, Schumann is not convinced that the balance will end up on the positive side. \"At the moment, there are first and foremost losses,\" he says. It's not even clear if the construction industry has the capacity to deal with demand. Theoretically the catastrophe could lead to a boom, \"but it's impossible to say right now if that will really happen.\"",

"story": "Merkel praises Spain's bailout request Angela Merkel has spoken out in favor of Spain's requested bailout of its banking sector for the first time, adding that Spain will face different conditions than countries who received complete sovereign bailouts. For the first time since Spain announced it would be seeking help from the European Union for its banking sector, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has commented on the move, saying Spain had made the right decision in applying for a recapitalization of its banks. However, Merkel was clear to say that any aid for Spain's banking sector would not come without strings attached. \"There will of course be conditions for Spain,\" Merkel said on Tuesday in Berlin at the economic council of her party, the Christian Democrats (CDU). \"Namely, a restructuring of its own banking system to make it fit for the future.\" Different conditions This would be, according to Merkel, different than conditions applied to countries that have sought bailouts to cover an entire sovereign economy, such as Greece, Ireland, or Portugal. In the case of Spain, the bailout only applies to the banking sector. Reflecting on the European Union as a whole, Merkel said the bloc must stick by the agreed reforms until the end to make sure they bear fruit. \"It would be fatal, now that some countries have started to move in the right direction, to stop halfway there,\" she said. The structural reforms, which would include a financial supervisory body at the European level, are seen by some European politicians as necessary to help get the eurozone out of its current crisis. \"If we need European institutions that keep a better eye on things, then we have to give up some of our national jurisdiction,\" Merkel said, referring to concessions that would have to be made to the EU should the reforms be put into place. More than just spending Meanwhile, French President Francois Hollande said in a speech to France's Social, Environmental, and Economic Council that spending alone would not be the only way to spur economic growth and bring about a European recovery. \"[Growth] will not be born of supplemental public spending,\" he said. \"It can emerge from our common European desire to put new instruments in place: eurobonds, financial instruments - we can think big.\" Merkel opposes the idea of \"eurobonds,\" which would be jointly-guaranteed eurozone government debt. She favors a mix of austerity and structural reforms to pull Europe back from the brink. mz/msh (AP, AFP, dpa)",

"story": "New Belgian Leader Gets Nod from Parliament Belgian members of parliament gave a vote of confidence Saturday to an incoming coalition government led by Flemish Christian Democrat Yves Leterme, sealing the end of a nine-month political crisis. The 97-48 vote, with one abstention, in the lower chamber of deputies, was not unexpected, with the coalition partners -- the Flemish and francophone Liberals and Christian Democrats, plus francophone Socialists -- in favor. Leterme, 47, succeeds Flemish Liberal Guy Verhofstadt with a mandate that should in theory run until 2011 -- but which could well be abbreviated, as his own party has set a July 15 deadline for more powers to be given to Flanders. \"That deadline will be respected,\" Leterme told parliament Saturday, a day after he and his 15-member cabinet were sworn into office by Belgium's King Albert II after protracted negotiations with other political groupings. Uniter, not a divider? Leterme has his work cut out to persuade Belgium's francophones -- concentrated in Brussels and the southern Wallonia region -- of his ability to unite the country in the wake of general elections back in June 2007. Flanders, home to Belgium's Dutch-speaking majority, craves more regional powers to reflect its prosperity. It also resents the dollops of euros it now pays to subsidise the poorer, French-speaking Wallonia region to its south. \"I fear grave institutional chaos\" if the government falls in July, said the new employment minister, Joelle Milquet, leader of the francophone centrists, adding that the danger of Belgium splitting into two nations was now \"real.\" For the international community, such a possibility would be serious, given that both the European Union and NATO are headquartered in the capital Brussels. The new prime minister has promised to raise pensions and offer tax cuts for low earners although government revenues have been lower than expected. His plans have come under increasing scrutiny by the opposition and the media. Leterme -- who once confused Belgium's anthem with that of France and failed in two previous attempts to form a government -- fueled inter-communal anger in 2006 by suggesting that French-speakers were incapable of learning Dutch.",

"story": "Cloudy Skies Ahead for German Growth A group of leading economic experts have given a less-than-sunny forecast for Germany's economic growth, as the high euro and surging oil prices dampen the modest recovery in the euro zone's biggest economy. In their widely watched autumn report, the German government's so-called \"Five Wise Men\" -- independent economic advisors -- said they were expecting the country's gross domestic product (GDP) to expand by just 1.4 percent next year, compared with an anticipated 1.8 percent this year. Those figures fall far short of the government's official forecasts that put growth at 1.8 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year. Coupled with a stark decline in domestic consumer spending and a growing dependency on exports, the slower economic growth rate will further burden the already critical state of Germany's public finances. High euro, low domestic spending to blame The runaway strength of the euro against the dollar is partially to blame for the downturn in the German economy, which is heavily dependent on exports, the experts said. \"A further rise in the euro would result in risks for growth momentum next year,\" said the report, which was published on Wednesday. The panel of experts, which actually comprises four men and one woman, said that strong export growth this year had \"enabled Germany to break out of a three-year period of economic stagnation.\" \"But the weakening in growth since this autumn emphatically illustrates the vulnerability of a recovery driven primarily by external economic factors,\" the experts said. \"While global economic developments remain robust, they will be slowed by the rise in oil prices and it is therefore decisive that domestic investment and private consumption get on a better footing in Germany,\" they diagnosed. A modest upturn in equipment spending in the second half of this year provided the \"first encouraging sign\" for a possible improvement in domestic demand. \"Our prognosis for next year is a gradual revival in domestic demand coupled with fundamentally positive impulses from the global economy.\" Nevertheless, \"we're still a long way from seeing a sweeping upturn in the domestic economy,\" the experts said. The modest pace of growth will remain more or less unchanged in 2004 and 2005, the report estimated. Public finances at risk The absence of a stronger pick-up in the economy also spelled bad news for Germany's public finances. \"The state of Germany's public finances remains critical,\" the experts wrote, predicting that the German public deficit would breach EU budget rules for the fourth year in a row next year. Under the terms of the European Stability and Growth Pact, drawn up in 1997 largely at Germany's behest, euro zone countries are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of GDP. But the German deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003, and is expected to do so again this year. German Finance Minister Hans Eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back below the 3.0 percent ceiling in 2005. However, the \"Five Wise Men\" predicted the deficit ratio would remain at 3.5 percent again in 2005. In a sign that the government has acknowledged, if not accepted, the cloudy forecast, Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der said it \"won't be easy\" to bring the public deficit back under 3.0 of GDP next year.",

"story": "Social entrepreneurs take on inequality at Davos The journey to the winter wonderland of Davos has been long for many participants in the WEF 2014. Among them are a group of social entrepreneurs who've come here from all over the world to make their voices heard. It's breakfast in lofty heights for a group of social entrepreneurs, as they're lodging on the Schatzalp - one of the highest-elevation spots in Davos. Vacant rooms are few and far between during the World Economic Forum, and the group can only reach their hotel after a 10-minute mountain railway ride. For social entrepreneur Mads Kjaer from Denmark, it's a very special day as he has breakfast together with Nobel Peace Prize winner Mohamed Yunus, who was able to escape from the hustle and bustle in the meeting center for a few moments and is also residing on the Schatzalp. Kjaer manages to get a few tips from the prominent guest as to how to run his business. The Dane's firm is called My C4, through which he collects money for entrepreneurs on the ground in Africa. The online platform presents projects and coordinates co-financing. \"A credit of $1,000 [738 euros] is enough to create five jobs,\" said the Dane, who lives in Kenya. He's collected and allocated 22 million euros in the past seven years. Small group, big impact 30 social entrepreneurs have come to Davos at the invitation of the Schwab Foundation. Many have a long journey behind them, as they came from as far way as India, South Africa and Rwanda. In their home countries, they've founded companies with a view to promote social change. They build schools, improve the healthcare system, or help unemployed youth. At the World Economic Forum, they join with the world's mighty in debating global issues. Considering the 2,600 participants in the forum, they are but a tiny group - but the topics they raise draw a good deal of attention. Combating poverty \"The way we've acted in the past few decades has led to more inequality and more people going hungry,\" said Philippine social entrepreneur Bam Aquino. \"There's poverty all over the world, and so many feel the urge to behave differently.\" His firm Hapinoy supports small entrepreneurs across his home country who, with their network of kiosks, have helped supply goods to people who need them. The uneven distribution of wealth is an abundantly debated topic in Davos. Small wonder, as the presence of only few rich people among many poor creates high potential for conflict. Blue-blooded social entrepreneur Fazle Hasan Abed from Bangladesh has been aware of that for a long time. The 77-year-old has been knighted by the Queen of England for his commitment to social justice. His organization called BRAC now has 100,000 members. He started out in 1972 when he was still working for Shell in London. He became fully aware of the poverty levels in his home country upon visiting. He sold his house for 7,000 British pounds and used the money to found BRAC, which helps to improve people's lives by organizing school education or granting micro-credit. \"People will remain poor if we do not invest in education,\" he told DW. Failed policy-making? Politicians fail quite often, Sir Fazle Hasan Abed said - hence social entrepreneurs must step in, particularly in emerging and developing nations. A company has to earn money in order to be able to invest, he added. What he owned now belongs to BRAC. \"I don't need a house, nor do I need a car,\" he stated. He said he's confident about Bangladesh's future. \"We have 6 percent growth annually, and after the terrible accident in the textile factory, our government has finally introduced a minimum wage to improvie the situation of many people, he said.

"story": "Afghanistan market blast kills dozens Officials say dozens of people have been killed in a suicide bomb attack at a busy market in southeastern Afghanistan. The blast underlines the country's fragile political and security situation. A suicide bomber on Tuesday blew up a vehicle packed with explosives at a busy market in southeastern Afghanistan, killing at least 89 people and injuring scores more, according to a Defense Ministry spokesman. Officials said most of the victims were civilians. The explosion also damaged shops, houses and cars nearby, according to witnesses. Several people were said to be still buried under rubble, meaning the death toll could rise further. The attack in the Urgun district of Paktika province is the worst in the war-torn country in months. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but Taliban insurgents often use suicide attacks as a weapon. The bombing followed just hours after a roadside bomb in eastern Kabul killed two passengers in a minivan carrying employees of the presidential palace. Five others in the van were injured. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for that attack in a statement sent to reporters. Perilous instability Attacks by the Taliban are gaining intensity as part of their annual spring offensive. The militants appear also to have stepped up their campaign ahead of the withdrawal of US-led foreign forces by the end of 2014. A UN report last week said civilian casualties in Afghanistan soared by 24 percent to 4,853 in the first half of 2014 compared with the same period in 2013. Tuesday's attacks come just days after a weekend deal between two Afghan presidential rivals brokered by US Secretary of State John Kerry seemed to avert a looming danger to the country's nascent democracy. Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani, who have been contending to take over from incumbent President Hamid Karzai, agreed to allow an audit of all eight million ballots cast in a runoff election in which preliminary results showed Ghani as a clear winner. Abdullah had blamed the result on massive cheating. tj/msh (AP, AFP)",

"story": "Nigeria analyst predicts security revamp after Buhari victory As the vote count progressed in Nigeria on Tuesday, victory by former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari looked increasingly certain. To find out about the implications of this, DW spoke to analyst Manji Cheto. DW: How do you think Nigeria is likely to change under Muhammadu Buhari? Manji Cheto: Nobody has a definitive answer as to what his government could be like but there are clearly important clues that we could take from his previous two and a half year stint as military leader. I think the most symbolic thing about his victory is that he has a reputation as one of the most incorruptible leaders in Nigeria. In a country where that reputation is not believed to exist for people occupying a senior position, that is quite significant. Now it is left to be seen whether or not that is going to have a positive impact on his government and the people who take on the positions in his government. Again, if you look at what is happening with Nigeria's key economic indices \u2013 Nigerian stock, Nigerian bond yields \u2013 a lot of those things have decelerated quite rapidly and I think that is a reflection of waning investor confidence in the country. With Nigeria now demonstrating to the world that it is capable of changing a government and [bringing in] a guy who has a positive reputation, that is quite significant. That investor boost could actually see more money being pumped into the Nigerian economy. Do you see any immediate change forthcoming in the way Nigeria is handling the Boko Haram insurgency? I don't think so. I think one of the things we can definitely expect before we talk about a change of strategy is a change in security personnel. Buhari having been a military leader, he understands Nigeria's military, its weaknesses and strengths, and he is certainly going to want to have people who he can trust and who he can work with. So I think the most immediate change we are going to see is a change in the security apparatus. Buhari is a former military ruler, as you said, but he says he is now a \u2018converted democrat.' How much doubt is there in Nigeria about his commitment to democratic governance? You're going to get a fifty-fifty doubt. There are people who are going to be incredibly cynical. That is one of the key challenges that he has, reconciling with the people who feel aggrieved by Jonathan's exit from office. So, yes, I think at the moment there is a fair bit of cynicism on that front. Nigeria is divided into a mainly Muslim north and a mainly Christian south. As a Muslim from the north, will Buhari be able to unite the country behind him? The Muslim north and Christian south dichotomy is far more complex than that. If you look at the south, particularly the southwest, there is a considerable number of Muslims there. And Buhari has allied himself with the southwest where people are Muslims who identify with the Islamic faith, but they don't actively practice Islam. So I think it is far more complex and I think a lot of Nigerians will start to look beyond that to see if he can demonstrate himself to be a true Nigerian president, as opposed to a northern president. I think the fact that he is aligned with the southwest is a key positive development in that respect. What about Nigeria's relations with its neighbors? Do you see this changing under a President Buhari? I don't think that is going to be a priority for the new government. I think the priority will certainly be dealing with the internal challenges and some of the military weaknesses. Once that is addressed I think the relationship with neighbors, which has been a bit tense in recent times over security, will start to improve. The elections are not over. There are gubernatorial and state assembly polls on April 11. How do you see them playing out in the wake of Buhari's victory? The presidential election has been tightly contested so I expect the same to happen. There are obviously going to be a number of key flashpoints. Key battlegrounds will include places like the economically powerful Lagos and Rivers State which is the largest oil producing state. The outcome of those elections is quite significant for whether we can look at the broader electoral process and judge it to be free and fair and quite credible.

"story": "Clashes in Nicaragua over canal construction Nicaraguan police have used tear gas and rubber bullets to break up protesters opposed to a forthcoming $50 billion shipping canal. The government plans to expropriate land for the Chinese-built project. Up to 21 people were injured on Wednesday in clashes between police and protesters in southern Nicaragua, over a planned transoceanic canal. The injured included 15 officers and six civilians. At least 33 people were arrested. The confrontation took place on the Pan American Highway near El Tule, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) southeast of the capital Managua. Police said authorities used force to end a blockade on the highway. The protests began following the inauguration of the canal on Monday when workers broke ground on the $50 billion (41 billion euro), 280-kilometer-long project, which could rival the Panama Canal. The canal will require the expropriation of land, displacing around 30,000 people, and protesters are concerned their homes and farming areas are under threat. It will cross Lake Nicaragua - Central America's largest lake - and run through rainforest and 40 villages. The canal is being built by Chinese firm Hong Kong Nicaragua Development Investment (HKND), owned by billionaire Beijing-based entrepreneur Wang Jing. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega says property owners affected by the canal's construction will receive a just price for their land. Although the environmental, technical and financial studies of the project are secret, it will include the construction of a railway, ports and an oil pipeline. Officials expect the canal, which will connect the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, to be operational in 2019. jr/gsw (AP, Reuters, AFP)",

"story": "EU fears the worst in Egypt After the recent violent escalation in Egypt, European Union representatives are calling for political dialogue to resume. But so far, there's little sign of a targeted or collective EU effort. The EU is increasingly at a loss at how to react to the situation in Egypt. On Wednesday, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton reacted with a number of statements to the violence. She called on the security forces to act with the utmost restraint, and on the transitional government to put an end to the violence as quickly as possible. Earlier, Ashton had called on the demonstrators to avoid further provocation and escalation. She also condemned the attacks on Coptic Christian churches in Egypt - criticism clearly directed against the Muslim Brotherhood. But her comments were mainly directed at the government and the security forces. Ashton spoke of an \"uncertain future\" for Egypt should the confrontation continue. There still was, however, the possibility of a \"different future\" if all sides would come together and back a political process that, via democratic elections, could bring back democratic structures and would allow for a peaceful participation of all political forces. EU missions have failed Yet the EU has been reduced to a mere spectator. Officially, Bernardino Leon, EU special envoy for the Middle East, is still working on resolving the crisis through negotiation. But his latest bid along with US diplomat William Burns has failed. Leon said that, while the Muslim Brotherhood had agreed to the deal, the military had not; and that only hours later, the army had started the crackdown on the pro-Morsi camps. Leon therefore put the blame for the violence mostly on the transitional government and the military. In an official statement, European Parliament President Martin Schulz stressed the responsibility of the authorities \"to ensure that all Egyptians - regardless of their political convictions - can protest peacefully.\" It was the government's \"duty\" to find a peaceful and just solution to the current crisis, Schulz said. Not ready to talk It seems the EU is taking the side of the Muslim Brotherhood. In fact, Ashton has repeatedly called for the release of ousted President Mohammed Morsi. Yet at the same time, the EU has been critical of the Brotherhood's attempts to pull Egypt into a more Islamist direction. Some observers accuse Brussels of hypocrisy, arguing that while the bloc is criticizin the military now, it was in fact rather sympathetic to the removal of Morsi. Elmar Brok, a German member of the European parliament for Chancellor Merkel's conservatives, doesn't actually believe that one would necessarily have to choose between these two sides. He told DW that \"one should side with the third group - the majority of the people - who want a secular state.\" The EU should \"get the military not only to stick to the roadmap to democracy\" but also to undertake yet another attempt \"to find a modus vivendi with the Muslim Brotherhood.\" The biggest problem, according to Brok, is that none of the three sides - military, Muslim Brotherhood or secular groups - are actually willing to seriously talk to each other. Berlincalls for EU crisis meeting The EU though doesn't seem to be drawing any consequences from the recent violence, it has not suspended financial aid to Egypt. In fact, none of the large EU states have. Only Denmark has axed its bilateral aid to the tune of 30 million euros. Brok advises against using money as leverage in negotiations. \"This would impact especially negatively on the future prospects of precisely those young people who are fighting for more democracy and for a secular state. And the tense social situation would lead to even more riots.\" The foreign policy expert said he was still pinning his hopes on further attempts to mediate between the two sides - admitting himself that the hope seems forlorn right now. Should talks break down entirely, Brok fears there might be a \"civil war or some kind of Islamist terrorism.\" German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle has called for an emergency meeting for the EU to discuss the situation in Egypt. During his current trip to Tunisia, Westerwelle stressed that a collective EU effort was in the bloc's interest as the violence was \"not happening just anywhere - but in Europe's neighborhood.\"",

"story": "Syria at 'make or break moment,' Steinmeier calls for no-fly zone The UN is to begin an investigation into the attack on an aid convoy, as Germany suggests a no-fly zone over Syria. Tensions remain high between the US and Russia following the airstrikes, which killed 21 people. Leaders met in New York on Wednesday for a crisis meeting of the UN Security Council, as Washington and Moscow traded accusations over an attack on an aid convoy that has left the future of the ceasefire in doubt. \"We are at a make or break moment,\" UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told members of the council, as he announced plans to carry out a \"vigorous\" independent investigation into the air raid. The 31-truck convoy was pounded by airstrikes near Aleppo on Monday, leading to the deaths of at least 21 people. The incident prompted the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross (IRC) to initially suspend all aid deliveries to the country. However, the UN said later on Wednesday that it would resume aid convoys. The International Syria contact group was due to meet in New York on Thursday, which could offer a chance for the US and Russia to overcome their differences and salvage a ceasefire. Ahead of those talks, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier proposed a temporary no-fly zone over Syria to save the virtually failed truce. \"The situation is now on a knife edge,\" Steinmeier said on Wednesday evening (local time) in New York. \"If the ceasefire is to have a chance at all, the only path leads towards the creation of a temporary but complete cessation of all military aircraft movements over Syria - at least for three, but even better for seven days.\" The German minister said the short-term arrangement would enable the restarting of aid deliveries to civilians. The trucks targeted in Monday's bombing, belonged to the UN and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC), and were delivering aid for some 78,000 civilians in the town of Urm al-Kubra in Aleppo Governorate. The ceasefire that had been brokered by Washington and Moscow had already virtually collapsed prior to the attack amid violations throughout the week. The US and Russia were both in attendance at the UN meeting. \"Supposedly we all want the same goal [for Syria],\" Secretary of State John Kerry said. \"But we are proving woefully inadequate in...making that happen.\" Tit for tat The talks came the same day Russia said a US drone had been operating in the same area where the airstrike occurred, though the Pentagon has denied this claim. Washington and Moscow have been engaged in a tit for tat for the past several days, with Washington accusing Moscow of changing its narrative about what happened on the day of the convoy attack. \"All of our information indicates clearly that this was an airstrike,\" White House Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes said on Tuesday. \"That means that there only could have been two entities responsible - the Syrian regime or the Russian government.\" US officials told Reuters news agency that two Russian Sukhoi SU-24 warplanes had been detected in the skies above the convoy at the moment the attack happened. Both Moscow and Damascus have denied responsibility for the strike. blc/jil (dpa, AP, AFP)",

"story": "Athletics: Norovirus makes these 'no ordinary world championships' The outbreak of a stomach virus at the IAAF World Championships in London has officials scrambling to contain it. The German team and delegation are among those taking great pains to try to prevent it from spreading. Germany's athletics team and staff have been among the hardest hit by the outbreak of the stomach virus at the world athletics championships in London, however, their medical staff on Thursday said the worst may be over. \"We have no new case,\" Dr. Andrew Lichtenthal told the DPA news agency. He added that only one German athlete remained in quarantine - of a total of seven athletes and six support staff who have been infected by what appears to be the norovirus, although only two cases have been confirmed in London. The outbreak has caused the delegation to go to extraordinary lengths to try to contain the outbreak at a track meet that has become \"no ordinary world championships,\" as the German athletics federation's (DLV) head coach, Idriss Gonschinska, put it. For one thing, German athletes and staff arriving after the outbreak are being put up at different hotels from the one near London's Tower Bridge, where it was detected. These include a couple of Germany's biggest medal hopes, javelin throwers Johannes Vetter and Thomas R\u00f6hler. At the same time, the hygienic measures in place at the main team hotel have been stepped up. Limited personal contact Speaking to German public broadcaster ARD, Gonschinska said that due to how contagious the virus is, everything possible was being done to limit physical personal contact between members of the team and staff. Athletes and staff have been told to avoid contact with their counterparts from other hotels, where the virus may or may not be present. \"Then the next step was to ban all treatment except for emergencies, because we know that any personal contact raises the risk of infection,\" Gonschinska said. \"Physiotherapy is only being given in the case of emergencies, so de facto it isn't happening\" Telephone, Skype, Whatsapp He also said that the coaches are primarily communicating with each other and the athletes through electronic media - and that they hadn't and wouldn't hold any team meetings, as they normally would. There will be no joint training, including between members of the relay teams. \"I will be just happy if we can get a relay team to the starting line,\" Gonschinska said. The athletes have also been instructed to wash their hands regularly and avoid hugging each other or even shaking hands. Eating fruit that is left out for them at the facilities is also a no-go area. As Rebekka Haase put it after her heat in the 200-meter dash:\"We are only allowed to high-fives with our elbows.\" \"This wasn't the sort of situation we had expected when we were on our way to London, but this applies to the other teams as well,\" Gonshinska concluded.",

"story": "Bundesliga: Robert Lewandowski returns to scoring form as Bayern Munich beat Schalke Bayern Munich moved within touching distance of their fourth consecutive championship with a routine win over Schalke. Lewandowski added another two to his impressive scoring record, while Vidal scored the third. Bayern Munich 3-0 Schalke (Lewandowski 53', 64', Vidal 73') After sitting out of Bayern Munich's Champions League win at Benfica, Robert Lewandowski returned to the side to score a double to extend their lead at the top of the Bundesliga to 10 points. The Polish center forward - without a goal in his last three matches - decided the outcome with two simple finishes in the second half, before Arturo Vidal continued his excellent streak with a third. Given Bayern Munich's season has still to reach its crescendo as a semifinal meeting with Atletico Madrid looms large, it was little surprise that Guardiola made six changes from Wednesday's win over Benfica. Rafinha, Juan Bernat, Medhi Benatia, Kingsley Coman, Mario G\u00f6tze and Robert Lewandowski all returned to the starting lineup. Javi Martinez was left out of the matchday squad, but will be available for the German Cup semifinal against Werder Bremen on Tuesday. Bernat and Costa looked menacing on the left in the opening stages, with the Brazilian winger firing a half volley over the crossbar in the first minute. But Schalke's compact 5-4-1 formation was impenetrable for the entirety of the first half - as alarming as it got for the Royal Blues was a glancing header from Lewandowski that was matched by Schalke keeper Ralf F\u00e4hrmann. Schalke were clearly tetchy in possession and squandered a number of decent counter-attacking situations. Junior Caicara, advanced on the right flank, forayed into positions behind Bernat, but his passing lacked precision. Manuel Neuer's only real task against his former club was to pluck a header out of the air from Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. Sharp-shooter Lewandowski scores Bayern upped the tempo of their play after the break and peppered F\u00e4hrmann's goal with a handful of efforts. On 51 minutes, Arturo Vidal, who has become one of the team's most important players in recent weeks, spun past his marker and dragged his shot inches past the target. Two minutes later, Vidal's header set up Lewandowski whose control and finish broke the deadlock. The 27-year-old striker took his tally to 27 for the season, finishing off an incisive move that emanated from Rafinha's work rate on the right-hand side. Lewandowski has been peerless in his consistency over the season, however the form of Chilean midfielder Vidal has been pivotal in the last few weeks. Vidal's form has been impressive since a man-of-the-match performance in Bayern's 4-2 win over Juventus in the last 16 of the Champions League. He scored a double on international duty with Chile before gaining Bayern a first leg lead over Benfica. His thumping finish on Wednesday gave Bayern the important cushion to book a spot in the semifinals. With 17 minutes left, Vidal finished off Franck Ribery's cross to score his fourth goal in five games and seal the win that moved Bayern a step closer to clinching the league title. Schalke, tied on 45 points with Mainz and Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, are four points off fourth-placed Hertha with four games remaining.",

"story": "Belarus orders international watchdog to close its Minsk office The world's largest regional security organization must close its doors in Minsk, after the Belarusian government refused to extend its mandate. The OSCE had criticized the election of President Alexander Lukashenko. Belarus has ordered the closure of the office of Europe's main rights watchdog, the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), in Minsk after the body issued a report critical of the December election, in which incumbent President Alexander Lukashenko won around 80 percent of votes. \"The Belarusian side has taken the decision not to continue the operations of the OSCE office in Minsk,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Andrei Savinykh said Friday. He added that an evaluation of the OSCE's activities in Minsk showed that the mission, which was set up in 2003, had fulfilled its mandate. The government has the right to revoke the mission's permit or refuse to renew it. Tense relations with West Critics expressed concern that the closure of the OSCE office in Minsk would have negative ramifications for Belarus' relationship with its western neighbors. \"This will lead to a worsening of relations with the European Union and increase the influence of Russia in Belarus,\" Grigory Kostusev, a member of the Belarusian National Front party who opposed Lukashenko, told Reuters news agency. Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since 1992, has been accused by Western leaders in the past of dictatorial rule and suppressing independent media. Germany condemned the OSCE office closure, saying the move was another step backwards for democratic rights in the country. \"With its authoritarian direction, the government in Minsk is separating the country even more from European values of freedom,\" said German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle. \"We will discuss with our partners what consequences are required in the face of the Belarusian government's voluntary policy of isolation.\" In a statement issued Friday evening, the foreign minister of neighboring Lithuania, Audronius Azubalis, expressed \"deep regret\" over Minsk's refusal to extend the mandate of the OSCE office. Ongoing detentions Minsk is still holding hundreds of demonstrators who were arrested during protests following the December 19 election. Five opposition candidates and 22 activists have been charged with organizing mass disorder, which could carry a jail sentence of up to 15 years. Belarus is part of the 56-member OSCE, which was set up during the Cold War as a forum for dialogue between communist states and the West. The organization is made up of European and Central Asian countries as well as the US and Canada. Author: Darren Mara, Sarah Harman (AFP, Reuters) Editor: Nancy Isenson",

"story": "Michael Schumacher -- From Go-Carts to Grand Prix He's the undisputed hero of Formula One racing and just a step away from a sixth world championship. But despite life in a very fast lane, Michael Schumacher has managed to keep things from spinning out of control. Michael Schumacher got behind the wheel early on in life. At the age of four his father gave him a pedal go-cart and set him loose. A collision between young Michael's cart and a local lamppost might have put an end to the racing story, but his dad decided to send him to a local go-cart track where lampposts weren't a problem. It was a fortuitous decision and the beginning of one of the most dazzling careers ever in Formula One racing. Born in 1969 in the village of H\u00fcrth-Herm\u00fchlheim in Germany's Rhineland region, his father's interest in go-carting -- he later managed a local track -- provided the spark to his career. Soon after his father sent him to the course, Schumacher's natural talent for racing began to show. Although he considered it just a hobby, he starting winning races and earning a name for himself on the carting circuit. In 1984 he became German Junior Champion and one year later he finished runner-up in the Junior World Championship. In 1988 Schumacher graduated from go-carts; in 1992 he won his first major car racing championship. Three years later, he became the youngest double Formula One World Champion by winning the 1994 and 1995 seasons. He took home the top trophies again in 2000, 2001 and 2002. After a victory on Sunday in Indianapolis, Schumacher is one point shy of a record-breaking sixth World Championship title. He will race again in Suzuka, Japan on October 12, and most racing watchers expect Michael Schumacher to enter the record books on that day. Lucrative career choice Life behind the wheel of a Formula One race car, almost more jet airplane than car, has been good to Schumacher, who was estimated by Forbes magazine to be the highest paid athlete in the world. He's come a long way from the days when his father had to find a sponsor to support his go-cart racing. Today, racing around a track at speeds of more than 200 miles an hour for the Ferrari racing team and the lucrative product endorsements earn Schumacher in the neighborhood of \u20ac70 million ($80 million) a year. He's well on his way to career earnings of \u20ac1 billion. But driving for Formula One is quite different than speeding down a German autobahn, and while Schumacher has a seemingly in-born talent for knowing how fast he can take curves safely, he is renowned for his discipline and leadership. He exercises four hours a day, largely to strengthen his neck muscles, which have to endure enormous G-forces in every race. After the gym, it's back to the track for hours of driving so he will be in top form for the two critical racing hours, usually held on Sunday afternoons. It's the thrill of the speed that keeps him in racing, he says. The danger -- and it can be extreme -- doesn't have any special appeal, especially since Schumacher is married and has two young children. \"None of us want to die,\" he said in an interview. \"We don't do it for the thrill of the danger. We do it for the thrill of speed.\" He said there are some risks he refuses to take. Positive role model Sunday's victory in the U.S. (photo) was Schumacher's 70th race win, and his career statistics are a source of awe to every motor sports enthusiast. His average finish in 172 Grand Prix starts has been between second and third and he's been a perennial on the winner's platform for the past 11 years. Every future driver, from the child getting a taste for go-cart racing to the young Formula One hopefuls (and probably a lot of daredevil men and women on freeways around the world), wants to emulate Schumacher. While no one doubts his record on the track, his off-track activities are also the stuff of positive role models. Schumacher has avoided, publicly at least, the pitfalls that have befallen many other German sporting stars. Family man Schumacher sees loyalty as a virtue and views a casual fling as a character flaw, in striking contrast to soccer legend Franz Beckenbauer and former tennis star Boris Becker, whose dalliances with women and troubles with the tax authorities regularly make the pages of the tabloids. That's not to say that Schumacher hasn't come in for some criticism. As one the sporting world's highest earners, Germany's favorite racing son has moved across the border to Switzerland to save on his tax bill. But much of the criticism that has been levelled at him has to do with the rarefied culture and sporting practices of Formula One as well as some of his questionable strategic tactics on the racetrack when the competition heats up. Another complaint that has arisen seems hardly fair, but Schumacher's consistency on the track, his strictly business attitude about racing and overall nice-guy demeanor can can translate in our media-driven age into a kind of blandness. Beckenbauer and Boris may be flawed, but those flaws stir the public's emotions. The visual language of their own sports, Beckenbauer's ballet-style performances on the soccer field and Becker's dives on the Wimbeldon center court, were enough to inspire legions of fans. Watching a Formula One race, the most fans see of Schumacher is his helmet, a car streaking down the straightaway in a straight line, maybe a daring passing maneuver or two.

"story": "Swedish military investigating report of Russian submarine wreck Divers have reportedly located the wreck of what could potentially be a Russian submarine off the east coast of Sweden. Authorities have reacted cautiously to the discovery and are examining footage of the wreck. The Swedish military is examining video taken by shipwreck divers purporting to show the wreckage of a Russian submarine just off the eastern coast of Sweden, officials said Monday. The find comes less than a year after Swedish authorities tried unsuccessfully to locate a reported Russian submarine near the capital of Stockholm. The search marked the country's biggest military mobilization since the Cold War. Authorities reacted with caution to the discovery Monday, with Armed Forces spokesman Anders Kallin refusing to say whether the military believed the vessel was Russian. \"We choose not to comment on it before we have seen more material. We will continue the analysis together with the company in the coming days,\" Kallin said. Another military spokesman, Jesper Tengroth, said that it was also too early to say for sure if the find was indeed a submarine. He added that it was better \"to come back with facts rather than speculation,\" and that there was no particular hurry \"because the wreck was not going anywhere.\" Ocean X Team, the diving company that discovered the wreck said on its website the Cyrillic letters on the hull of the craft \"indicate that it is Russian.\" It is unclear how old the vessel is or how long it has been lying on the ocean floor. The vessel is about 20 meters long and 3.5 meters wide, according to Ocean X Team. Officials did not provide the exact location of the wreck, but the Expressen tabloid, which published images of the reported submarine on its website, said it was found about 2.8 kilometers off the east coast of central Sweden. The discovery comes amid renewed concerns about possible incursions by Russian submarines into Western territorial waters and as tensions with Moscow continue to rise over events in Ukraine. Sweden built up an anti-submarine force after a Soviet sub with nuclear weapons ran aground off its southern shores in 1981. Toward the end of the Cold War, the Nordic country sought to destroy suspected Soviet submarines and the Swedish navy periodically carried out searches in its waters. But since then, its anti-submarine program has gradually been dismantled. bw/lw (AP, Reuters, AFP)",

Lagarde herself, however, is not ready to commit to seeking the job again. A statement from Germany's Finance Ministry on Thursday lent support to the idea of keeping Christine Lagarde in her position at the head of the International Monetary Fund for another term. \"Ms. Lagarde was a prudent and effective crisis manager in the difficult times after the financial crisis,\" the statement read from Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble's office read. \"At the same time, she managed to bundle the interests of IMF stakeholders and to further increase the efficiency of the IMF.\" British Finance Minister George Osborne issued a similar statement on Thursday saying, \"At a time when the world faces what I've called a dangerous cocktail of risks, I believe Christine has the vision, energy and acumen to help steer the global economy through the years ahead.\" Lagarde took part in a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday and briefly addressed the idea of second term at the IMF. \"I'll be waiting before I say anything about that,\" she said. Lagarde's term is set to run out in July. She has served as the IMF head since July 2011. mz/sms (AP, dpa)",

"story": "The Netherlands Opens Up Labor Market to Recent EU Members The Netherlands has now opened its borders fully to workers from countries that joined the European Union in 2004. It joins eight other EU nations which have already benefited from the same move. The Netherlands has dismantled its barriers one at a time. The first move was lifting restrictions on the number of workers allowed to migrate to the nation from countries that joined the EU; a total of 22,000 workers were formerly permitted entry. In June 2006, the government freed employers in 23 different sectors from the obligation of first having to search for qualified Dutch or other people from old member states before hiring, say, someone from Poland. In December last year, 16 other sectors of the labor market were added to the list. Polish supermarkets in The Hague Tens of thousands of Polish, Czech and Hungarians workers have meanwhile settled in the Netherlands. \"The Hague now has a slew of Polish supermarkets,\" said G\u00fcnther G\u00fclker of the German-Dutch Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Yet the Netherlands' borders did not open completely until March 1, 2007. Since then, workers from new EU-member states are welcome to work everywhere. There are over 250,000 jobs up for grabs in a country with just four percent unemployment. The construction industry in particular is desperate. \"There's an acute shortage in that area,\" said G\u00fclker. The Dutch government and employers' associations are convinced that the influx of new workers is boosting economic growth, which reached 2.9 percent in 2006. \"Opening up the employment market can certainly have a positive impact on the economy,\" said Paul de Beer, an economics professor at the University of Amsterdam. Economic sectors which have a shortage of workers can anticipate growth, he said. Equal pay for equal work There's a flip side too, however. In the long term, liberalization can push wages down. \"Many workers migrating to the Netherlands are willing to work for lower pay,\" de Beer said. \"That's going to have consequences.\" Yet the Dutch government has taken steps to protect domestic workers. Dutch law requires employers to pay newly arrived, foreign workers the same wages as their Dutch colleagues. In addition, employment agencies are to locate jobs for foreign workers. Employers have also obliged themselves to finding proper accommodation for the workers. Furthermore, a supervisory agency has also been established to handle complaints or infringements. Germany and Austria lagging behind The Netherlands isn't the first country to open up its labor market. Great Britain, Ireland and Sweden did not even impose limits following the EU's eastern enlargement. Finland, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain have already abolished entry restrictions. Belgium, Denmark, France and Luxembourg will follow suit in 2009. Only Germany and Austria want maintain their liberalization phase in transition until 2011. Those countries argue that their geographical location put their employment markets at risk: their proximity to the new EU-member states Bulgaria and Romania would make them even more vulnerable to foreign workers migration. Studies by the European Commission confirm Austria's fears. The number of citizens from \"new\" EU countries in Austria has doubled in the past three years -- to 1.4 percent. In Germany, however, the number has increased only slightly -- to 0.7 percent. The Munich-based economic research institute Ifo confirmed the figures. In 2004 and 2005, around 24,000 Eastern Europeans moved to Austria to work; only 12,000 moved to Germany. Positive economic effects The number of \"new\" EU citizens migrating to \"old\" EU countries has remained stable following expansion. Interestingly, figures should that the effects of foreign worker migration are positive: employees from eastern Europe did their part in filling the demand for qualified workers in other markets, the European Commission said. J\u00f6rg Lackenbauer, an economist at the Center for European Policy in Freiburg, agreed. More than 450,000 people have migrated to Great Britain from the EU-acceding countries. \"The effect on domestic employees was minimal. \"But the economy benefited from the effects of migration in that the potential for production and the gross domestic product rose,\" he said. In Germany, the debate about liberalizing the employment market for migrants has quieted. But it could get louder soon: the Czech Republic has announced it will focus on liberalization during its EU presidency beginning in January 2009. Without the current transitional periods for liberalization for countries like Germany and Austria, the EU's gross domestic product would currently be up to one percent higher,\" said Lackenbauer. \"Besides, liberalization of the employment market is one of the basic tenants of the single European market,\" he said. \"The treaty for establishing the European Community clearly dictates its implementation,\" he said.",

"story": "Death toll mounts in Kolkata flyover crash as rescuers search for survivors Many people have died and more than 150 have been injured after a flyover collapsed in the eastern Indian city. Rescuers are meanwhile working tirelessly to find people buried under the debris. At least 21 people have died and around 60 injured people have been admitted to nearby hospitals, dpa news agency reported. The incident occurred on Thursday morning after 80 meters (260 feet) of the flyover collapsed in Kolkata's busy Burrabazar area. \"The guilty will not be spared. We will take action against builders. This is a very serious incident,\" Mamata Banerjee, chief minister of West Bengal, told reporters. \"But our first priority is to rescue the trapped, treat the injured in hospital and console the families of those who have died,\" she added. India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, expressed his condolences on Twitter. Flyover collapse an 'act of God' Some 400 army personnel, including engineers and medical workers, were deployed at the site. The chief of the disaster response force, O.P. Singh, said the operation was a \"very very challenging task.\" Workers used bulldozers, saws, special cameras and sniffer dogs to find survivors. IVCRL, the construction company building the flyover, said it was missing 30-40 people who had been working on the site. \"We completed nearly 70 percent of the construction work without any mishap,\" IVCRL's senior official K.P. Rao told officials. However, the company was widely criticized after another senior employee, named only as Dilip, described the incident as \"a total act of God.\" Many Indians took to Twitter to express their frustration at the hazard. Sonal criticized the builders for calling the tragedy an \"act of God.\" This user criticized the corrupt political system and negligence that led to the flyover crash. mg/rc (AP, dpa)",

"story": "The Roaring Twenties \u2014 an illustrated trip through an eventful decade Illustrator Robert Nippoldt and author Boris Pofalla have published a fascinating book about Berlin's golden era, the Roaring Twenties. It reflects the interest now taken in the art scene of the Weimar Republic. It stands a good chance of becoming a cult book. Illustrator Robert Nippoldt, born in the Lower Rhine region in 1977, started working on this book about Berlin during the Weimar Republic several years ago. Publishing such a splendid work that contains drawings and graphics does take time. \"Es wird Nacht in Berlin der Wilden Zwanziger Jahre\" (Night Falls in Berlin of the Roaring 20s) can truly be considered a complete work of art. You can even \"listen\" to the book ... On more than 200 pages, the author has depicted Berlin during the Roaring Twenties in black-and-white images, tinged with a light bronze color. The beautiful, large-sized book has been enriched by texts by art critic Boris Pofalla. It also contains a CD with sounds of the time, including songs by Renate M\u00fcller and Ernst Busch, Lotte Lenya and Claire Waldoff, as well as music by other renowned musicians of the time. Book artist Nippoldt has experience depicting particular cultural eras, having already published books on Hollywood during the 1930s, and the New York jazz scene in the 1920s. Now, this latest book on Berlin in the Weimar Republic touches on a trend. Renewed interest in the Weimar Republic Why has 2017 seen a renewed interest in the Weimar Republic? It was the era that immediately preceded the rise of National Socialism. Critics described its art scene as extremely liberal, with some even calling it \"hedonistic,\" warning that the pendulum might suddenly swing in the other direction. Tragically, those fears weren't unfounded. Soon, the Weimar Republic became shaken by severe economic problems. Some observers saw this as a consequence of the Treaty of Versailles that, in their view, was an unjust punishment for the First World War that Germany lost. One of the provisions of the treaty required Germany to take responsibility for damages and pay reparations. In addition, the growing weakness of crumbling mainstream political parties during this period paved the way for the rise of extreme political parties, the Communists on the left, and the National Socialists on the right. We all know what followed. So why the renewed interest in this period? Some observers have claimed that we might be heading back into a Weimar Republic-like era. What they have in mind is the reawakening of extreme political forces in Germany after decades of almost legendary political stability. Thank God the country hasn't gone that far yet. Besides, if there's something in 20th-century German culture worth being celebrated, then it's the myth of Berlin during the Weimar years. Film, music, dance, theater, cabaret and art of this era remain unforgettable, and have been commemorated over and over again during past decades. The \"Roaring 20s\" period, closely associated with the city of Berlin, is world-famous. \"Berlin shines in a glamor that Paris doesn't know\" A quotation from the book of Nippoldt and Pofalla says it all: \"Seen from the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm, the city looks to me like a scintillating gem. In the evenings, the city shines in a glamor that Paris doesn't know. I'm totally fascinated, these big coffeeshops are like ocean steamers, and the orchestras are their machines that resound all over the place, keeping it in motion. The music is everywhere.\" That's how superstar Josephine Baker described her feelings for a city in which she only spent two months in 1926. But it was an impression that was to last for a long time with a star who, in turn, was never forgotten by Berliners. Also \"Berlin Babylon\" looks back to the roaring 20s Music is also everywhere in one of the biggest film events of 2017, namely the German series \"Berlin Babylon,\" which has already been shown in theater previews and broadcast by pay-television channel Sky. It will be broadcast to a larger audience in the new year, on German public television channel ARD. The series has garnered tremendous international attention, not only because it was produced by several renowned directors and producers, but precisely because it conjures up this German cultural myth of Berlin during the 1920s. Museum presents \"Splendor and Misery of the Weimar Republic\" Throughout 2017, Germany's art scene has commemorated what is seen as an outstandingly creative decade, honoring it with one of the most beautiful exhibitions of the year, namely the show \"Splendor and Misery of the Weimar Republic\" at the Frankfurt-based museum \"Schirn.\" The show that runs through February 25, 2018 presents artists who have captured the Roaring 20s in their paintings. Among them are Georg Grosz, Otto Dix and Christian Schad, but the exhibition also reveals female artists who have not stood in the limelight until now. Readers of Robert Nippoldt's book likewise will come across some famous names, among them, of course, Josephine Baker, as well as painter Jeanne Mammen, and dancer Anita Berber. Coincidentally, the chapters in the book resemble the chapters in the Frankfurt exhibition: Vice and sex, the new woman, prostitution, as well as the devastating aftermath of the First World War in Germany, resulting in astronomical debts, mass impoverishment and political upheaval. The Nazis finished off the cultural boom And then, it all leads to the fateful year of 1933. The television series \"Babylon Berlin,\" the Frankfurt exhibition \"Glamor and Misery of the Weimar Republic,\" and the Berlin book by Nippoldt and Pofalla alike lead viewers, audiences and readers to the abrupt and very bitter end of an incredibly rich cultural era. The National Socialists did everything they could to finish off what they saw as decadence and hedonism. After the Nazi seizue of power, gone was the freedom in which literature, film, music, art, dance and theater could flourish. The only thing that has remained is the recollection of a golden decade during which Germany's then, and now-again-capital Berlin culturally overshadowed even Paris, New York and Hollywood. The German version of \"Es wird Nacht im Berlin der Zwanziger Jahre,\" 224 pages, illustrated by Robert Nippoldt and written by Boris Pofalla, accompanied by a CD, was published by Taschen Verlag. With its ISBN number 978-3-8365-6319-2 the German version can also be ordered by bookstores outside of Germany. The book will be translated into English by late summer or fall of 2018.",

"story": "ESC 2015: first set of finalists chosen Sixteen nations battled in the first semifinals to qualify for Eurovision Song Contest finale on May 23. Ten qualified. When the jury and spectators' votes were counted, they served up some surprises. After a glamorous downbeat delivered by last year's winner, Conchita Wurst, it was on to the contest, whose results surprised experts and betting agencies. Among the favorites, the Finnish punk band Pertti Kurikan Nimip\u00e4iv\u00e4t didn't advance to the next round. With its fairy tale backdrop and theme of genocide, \"Face The Shadow\" seems a bit over-composed, but the song by Armenia's band Genealogy found favor with jury and spectators. Having placed its bets on a very young artist, Belgium made the finals as well. Lo\u00efc Nottet gave a strong and idiomatic song-and-dance performance of \"Rhythm Inside\" on a black-and-white stage set. Greece also took the hurdle with the pathos-laden ballad \"One Last Breath,\" sung by Maria Elena Kyriakou (picture above). Viewers also gave the thumbs-up to Estonia's pop rock song. In \"Goodbye to Yesterday,\" Elina Born and Stig R\u00e4sta rendered the bleak mood of a one night stand in song. Their Tuesday evening performance wasn't a one night stand, however; they'll be back at Saturday's finale. Big show, down-tempo sounds Serbia sent a substantial singer Bojana Stamenov to the stage. In \"Beauty Never Lies,\" the \"Serbian Beth Ditto\" delivered an explosive song, and her magnificent big dress generated the highest-octane glamour of all. Hungary qualified with Boggie's folksy and understated antiwar song, \"Wars For Nothing.\" Peace and reconciliation is also the subject of Russia's powerful ballad \"A Million Voices,\" with which Polina Gagarina made it to the final. Giving her all for Albania, Elhaida Dani squeaked \"I'm Alive\" in the highest pitches and entered the final round. Rumania's Voltaj convinced listeners with \"De la cap\u0103t,\" a song about parents who work abroad and leave their children behind. An energetic final number was delivered by Nina Sublatti from Georgia. Accompanied by a hectic laser show, she screamed \"Warrior\" into the audience, which then delivered the necessary votes for her to proceed to the final. Only 16 countries voted The order in which the songs were performed was not coincidental. Host broadcaster ORF (Austrian Public Broadcasting) had carefully chosen the starting positions so that the audience wouldn't be lulled to sleep with multiple slow songs in a row. But with the majority of entries in the 2015 edition of the ESC being ballads - performed with varying degrees of bombast and considerably removed from the zeitgeist - the risk of a certain boredom looms. The finale will benefit from a couple of up-beat exceptions like Belgium's young dance performance. All 16 acts were required to perform for the jury on Monday, which then awarded half of the points. The television audience then had the opportunity to call in their votes in Tuesday evening's show, with only the participating countries allowed to vote and none permitted to vote for their own country. The next semifinal is set for Thursday. A starting position is guaranteed to host country Austria and the five highest contributors to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU): Germany, France, Great Britain, Spain and Italy. This year, Australia was invited to participate and will also be among the 27 countries vying for the top honor on Saturday. Ann Sophie in good spirits After having given a splendid rehearsal performance, Germany's entry, Ann Sophie, gave a press conference on Tuesday. Calm, composed and spontaneous, she chatted casually with journalists from various countries in impeccable English and gave a brief impromptu rendition of part of a song by her favorite singer, Beyonc\u00e9. Wrapping up the appearance, she followed up with an acoustical sample of her ESC song \"Black Smoke,\" joined by her guitarist.",

"story": "Alpine 'Crypto Valley' pays with Bitcoins The town of Zug in Switzerland wants to become the center of a Swiss \"Crypto Valley.\" Residents can now pay their fees in Bitcoin, and Fintech companies in the region are closely watching this experiment. Zug's mayor, Dolfi M\u00fcller, was surprised by the considerable media response. The city council was simply looking for a creative way to grease Zug's economy, \"With Bitcoin, we're sending a message: We in Zug want to get out in front of future technologies,\" he told DW. The council only realized in hindsight that their decision would make history. Zug is the first locality in the world to accept the digital currency. It's a humble start; payments are limited to the equivalent of 200 Swiss francs. M\u00fcller wanted to keep risk low while Zug tests the waters, he's aware of the controversy surrounding Bitcoin. Some argue the digital currency isn't secure enough for civilian use. Bitcoin's market price is volatile and scammers are still all too common. To mitigate this insecurity, all Bitcoin payments in Zug are immediately converted into the Swiss currency. \"That's what the stock exchange is for,\" says M\u00fcller, \"it saves us from losing huge amounts in nanoseconds.\" Feline micro-finance with Bitcoin Zug is a picturesque Swiss town complete with a lake and panoramic views of the Alps. The taxes are low, but rent is through the roof. The population is international. Maybe that's why Bitcoin enjoys near universal approval among Zug's residents. There were few complaints as to the opacity of the origins of Bitcoins. On the contrary, many people find Bitcoin transactions refreshing because they cut out a middleman - the banks. One woman is organizing a project to castrate stray cats on the island of Santorini. To expect to receive large donations for this project is na\u00efve, she says. Instead, she's turning to micro-finance, which Bitcoin is perfect for because it skirts banks fees. Bitcoins at the dentist However, Bitcoin still hasn't found its way into day-to-day transactions. Hotels, stores and restaurants don't accept the currency. Abbas Hussain-Probst is the exception. The dentist offers his patients the opportunity to rid themselves of toothache with Bitcoins instead of francs. But according to the dentist, public trust in Bitcoin is still low. Only a handful of his patients have paid with Bitcoin in the past year, and all of them work in IT. Of course, these are the people Zug's city council had in mind when they began accepting the digital currency. Moving toward a 'Crypto Valley' About 20 fintech companies have recently settled in Zug and neighboring Baar, including Bitcoin Suisse. The company has servers up in the Alps that run highly complex mathematical functions to mine new Bitcoins. To help popularize Bitcoins, the company also runs a number of Bitcoin-ATMs. One stands in Kafi Schoffel, a restaurant in Z\u00fcrich. In exchange for francs or euros, the machine spits out a nondescript strip of paper with a QR code on it. This code, when scanned by a smartphone, can be used as payment. Kafi Schoffel customers use them to buy cappuccinos. Niklas Nikolajsen, CEO of Bitcoin Suisse, predicts it will still take a number of years before digital currencies enjoy widespread use. But he's sure the day will come when everyone buys their cappuccinos with Bitcoins. Nikolajsen says digital currencies reduce barriers to the global economy, \"A taxidriver in Nairobi might be unable to accept credit cards because of high fees, but all he has to do is buy a five-dollar smartphone to accept Bitcoins.\"",

Centre for Journalism (City University, London) Diploma in European Journalism (Centre de Formation des Journalistes, Paris) I worked for DW, BBC World Service, Guardian, Independent, New Statesman etc. With DW since: 1992 Favorite quotes: \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.\u201d (Former US President John F. Kennedy) \u201cPoliticians are the same all over. They promise to build bridges even when there are no rivers.\u201d (Former Soviet Premier, Nikita Kruschev) My personal hero: Nelson Mandela What do I strive to be as a journalist? I have three ideals as a journalist: First of all, I strive to be as independent as possible. I have never been a member of a political party, and never will be. For me, membership of a political party is incompatible with independent journalism. I believe fervently in public service journalism as one of the few sources of independent information in a world full of vested interests. As a journalist, I want to deliver information that is independent of political, economic and cultural influence. Secondly, I strive to be as impartial as possible. This involves reporting on as many sides of the story as possible. There are almost always several perspectives on a story. It is our job as journalists to portray as many of these perspectives as possible and give a full picture of events and issues. It is then up to our audience to make up their own mind. In my view, in mass media such as radio and TV, we journalists should never tell you what to think. And thirdly, I strongly believe in our mission to explain. As journalists, it is our job to put events in a context, to make it easy for our audience to understand what is at stake. With our planet becoming ever more sophisticated and complex, this is a constant challenge. But then \u2026 what would life be without challenges, right? 7 trips I must make before I die: 1. The Kavango-Zambezi Trans-Frontier Conservation Area in southern Africa 2. The entire coastline of Mozambique, from Maputo in the south to Ibo in the north 3. The rainbow nation of South Africa, from east to west and then from north to south 4. The Okavango Delta in Botswana, when the water arrives and the animals migrate there 5. North-eastern Brazil, following the footsteps of Walter Salles\u00b4 film, \u201cCentral Station\u201d 6. The underbelly of the southern US, in a quest for the soul/music of that region 7. Latin America, from coast to coast and from head to toe",

"story": "New role for German soldiers in Mali? It seems that German troops are soon to be sent to northern Mali. They will not take part in combat operations but will play more of a support role to Dutch peacekeepers already stationed there. It seems to be a foregone conclusion - the German armed forces, the Bundeswehr, are to expand their area of operations to northern Mali. A debate on the pros and cons of this is already underway in the German media. Last week, a delegation of the German defense ministry returned from Mali and the news quickly leaked out that German soldiers are to strengthen the UN's Minusma peace mission in the north. The mission is currently focused on monitoring a peace accord for the region that was signed in June. There had long been speculation in the German press that the defense ministry was considering expanding the role of the Bundeswehr in the West African state. Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen had repeatedly said at international gatherings that Germany wished to play a stronger role in UN peace missions. The daily newspaper \"S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung\" got hold of an internal report compiled by a Bundeswehr team that returned from Mali at the beginning of last week. Should the suggestions contained in that report be implemented, the paper wrote in its Thursday edition, then \"an advance guard could be sent before the end of this year, followed in early 2016 by troops whose task would be to protect property, as well as other support units.\" Reconnaissance troops would then follow between April and June. The main task would be to support the Dutch mission that has a number of helicopter gunships in northern Mali. Little risk for German soldiers The head of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation (FES) in Bamako, Jan Henrik Fahlbusch, who has been closely observing the security situation in Mali does not believe that German troops will take part in combat missions in the near future. The risk of loss of life will, therefore, remain low. He sees the expanded mission as more of a complementary component for the Dutch troops. Under a mandate from the German parliament, the Bundestag, up to 350 German soldiers can be deployed in Mali. In 2014 the Bundeswehr had more or less ended its involvement with Minusma, retaining just 9 liaison officers. Previously the UN had declined the use of two elderly Transall cargo planes. The German planes could not fly at night and often remained grounded when the daytime temperature was particularly high. Minusma preferred to use planes from other countries - such as a transport aircraft from Ghana. Fahlbusch is optimistic that the new Minusma-related tasks will serve a useful purpose. The Dutch helicopter gunships are particularly important in efforts to increase stability and security in the region, he told DW. Up to now, Germany has been primarily involved in training the Malian army as part of an EU program. Some 200 German army trainers are currently stationed in southern Mali. Fahlbusch has collected data on the acceptance of the foreign military presence in Mali as part of an FES survey. He told DW the results show that the presence of the German training mission is generally seen in a positive light.",

"story": "Russian Bomb Claims Questionable, Expert Says The Russian military said Tuesday, Sept. 11, that it successfully tested a vacuum bomb it described as the world's most powerful conventional weapon. It's a claim arms expert Sascha Lange said is disputable. Sascha Lange, an expert in the analysis of arms development at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, said a Russian video showing a massive explosion is not solid evidence that the country has developed the \"father of all bombs.\" DW-WORLD.DE: The Russians announced they detonated a new vacuum bomb, saying it was the world's most powerful conventional weapon. What do you doubt about their claims? Sascha Lange: I doubt that everything took place the way the Russians claim. The pictures that were shown on state television do not clearly show what is claimed. For example, a Tupolev 160 \"Blackjack,\" a strategic bomber, is shown opening its bomb hatch in the pictures, but you do not see the weapon fall out of the plane. A cut is made and then a body falls out of a different plane. You can recognize this because there is a different weapons bay and the bomb releases differently than it would from a \"Blackjack bomber.\" Are there additional inconsistencies? Yes. You can see the weapon in free fall and you can see an explosion. But as big as the explosion in the pictures is, you cannot tell if it was caused by the bomb that has fallen. This large explosion could also have been carried out on the ground and not have resulted from the dropped bomb. When you examine the explosion, you see it happens on a completely level plain. Then pictures are shown with buildings and vehicles that are supposed to have been destroyed by the bomb. But they are not at visible before the explosion. There are several points where all the pictures don't entirely fit together and the claims are not at all supported by these pictures. The bomb is also not shown dropping from the \"Blackjack bomber's\" weapons bay. The pictures imply what is claimed in the Russian media, but they don't show it at all. You are referring to the video shown on Russian state television? Yes, exactly. They were also shown in the news media here [in Germany] with the headline \"Russia has new bombs.\" The arms technology is not fundamentally new. The exact terminology for it is a thermobaric weapon. The Americans used them in Vietnam War as well as in the last Gulf War. The concept was even considered by the Germans in World War II. The Russians have now simply issued a news report saying, \"We have the biggest bomb.\" I think it is mainly driven by domestic, political concerns -- for the Russian population to see that Putin is the strongest and now we also have the strongest bomb. Can you say whether Russia is actually in a position to build a bomb that has four times the power of the MOAB, the Americans' strongest known conventional weapon? Fundamentally the Russians could do it. They've constructed other munitions with these warheads, such as their artillery rockets. But I would not assume that the weapon shown has four times the explosive force of the American MOAB. It doesn't match up. For optical reasons? Right. The size is not big enough. The MOAB is a large bomb with a mass of 10 tons -- that's really something completely different. The dropping that was shown on Russian television reminded me much more of an older American thermobaric weapon, the \"Daisy Cutter.\" Russia claimed that it developed this weapon for the fight against terrorism. Is the bomb suitable for that? That is just as far-fetched as the claim that the Americans want to use nuclear weapons in the hunt for terrorists. The weapon is not suited for the fight against terrorism. It's just the opposite: in operations like in Afghanistan and Iraq, militaries are using the smallest munitions possible. The trend is going in a very different direction toward the smallest possible munitions with smaller explosive radii rather than to large bombs with as much explosive force as possible. Then how would the Russians' weapon be used? Psychologically, first of all. The Americans used this type of weapon in Vietnam to make clearings for helicopters in the jungle. In Iraq, they were used to detonate minefields. In Afghanistan, these bombs have been used extremely seldom, as far as I know. There, and also in Iraq, they would more likely be used for psychological warfare. They produce an incredible explosion, even if it is a conventional weapon. But from a military point of view, it's a very rarely used weapon. Where does Russia's military stand in international comparison? Not where it would like to see itself. The Russian armed forces suffered heavily at the end of the Cold War. Planes and tanks are gradually beginning to be built again, but they cannot replace what has aged away. The level of training has severely dropped over the past 15 years. There is a gradual upward trend now, but it is starting from a very low level. The Russians have a very long way to go before their armed forces really are taken seriously.",

"story": "Heavy snowfall cuts off Alpine towns in Switzerland and Austria Tourists in the Swiss resort town of Zermatt under the Matterhorn mountain peak have been stranded for the second time in a month. Officials expected more snow overnight. Thousands of people were stranded Monday morning in the Alps after heavy snowfall blocked train lines and roads to the towns of Zermatt in Switzerland and St. Anton in Austria. High-level avalanche warnings on Sunday forced local authorities to stop train services to Zermatt, leaving around 9,000 tourists marooned in the popular ski resort town. Some visitors were able to leave the area on Air Zermatt helicopters, but flights were discontinued after the weather worsened. Tickets for the service were also sold out within hours of train cancellations. Read more: Alpine snow leaves thousands of tourists stranded in Switzerland Travel difficulties were also affecting St. Anton where police restricted travel in and out of the town to cars with snow chains. Some buses transported people to a nearby valley under police and firefighter escort. Conditions were set to worsen in Zermatt into Monday with up to 70 centimeters (28 inches) of snow expected to fall overnight. Authorities expect land access to remain closed until midday on Monday. Severe snowfall had cut off 13,000 tourists in the town, which is located under the famous Matterhorn peak, for two days earlier in January. The resort's marketing chief said tourists do not suffer while they are snowed-in. An updated website is providing information for people trying to get in and out of the resort.

"story": "US prepares for fight over EU subsidies to Airbus EU subsidies for Airbus have long been a source of tension with the United States. Despite EU claims to have ended the financing, a skeptical Washington is now preparing for a fight at the World Trade Organization. United States trade officials said Friday that they were asking the World Trade Organization to sanction the European Union for alleged subsidies to aircraft manufacturer Airbus. Washington said the EU claimed in December 2011 to have removed all subsidies to Airbus that broke the WTO rules, but that the 27-member bloc never provided evidence. The US complained that not only have the subsidies continued, but that new subsidies have been introduced. \"We refuse to stand by while American businesses and workers are disadvantaged,\" US Trade Representative Ron Kirk said in a statement. \"By taking this action today, we are reiterating the Obama administration's commitment to ensuring that every one of our trading partners plays by the rules, and that American companies can compete on a level playing field,\" he added. The formal complaint to the WTO is to be submitted at a meeting of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body on April 13. EU 'regrets' action The WTO ruled last June that the EU and four member states had provided more than $18 billion (13.5 billion euros) in unfair subsidies to Airbus - an amount the EU disputes. The US and the EU began talks in January on compliance with the WTO order, but both sides held their ground. \"We regret that the US has chosen to take this step, since the EU notified its compliance with its WTO obligations in the package of steps taken at the end of 2011, and the US has yet to do the same in the Boeing case,\" said the European Commission's trade spokesman John Clancy. The WTO has also found that the US government paid $3 billion to $4 billion to domestic aircraft maker Boeing in the form of research grants and tax breaks. The US has argued that the EU had made Airbus dependant on its financing for \"every model of large civil aircraft,\" while no similar conclusion was found in the US-Boeing relationship. acb/msh (AFP, Reuters)",

"story": "Syria: 'Russia not interested in a political solution' UN envoy de Mistrua has announced Syrian peace talk slated to begin this week would be postponed. In an interview with DW, Bassma Kodmani from the Syrian negotiating team blames Russian aggression for talks' collapse. DW: The UN envoy Staffan de Mistrua has said that the peace talks have been suspended, but haven't failed. Would you agree with that assessment? Bassma Kodmani: I would completely agree. We, the High Negotiations Committee, came to Geneva to see if there was a plan to implement humanitarian solutions and settle them before we could start negotiating. The recess in the talks now is simply to say: these obligations have not been met at all, and on top of that, the entire process is being jeopardized by this week's very aggressive air campaign and military operations by the regime, its foreign militias and Russian air support. These operations are unprecedented in their intensity and must have been under preparation for several weeks. So we are wondering: how come there were all these diplomatic exchanges and commitments? So, even while [US Secretary of State] Kerry was talking with [Russian Foreign Minister] Lavrov the last few weeks, were the Russians preparing all along to discredit the US in this very visible and obvious manner by launching this operation just as the talks were supposed to start? That is really a very big question. To us, it seems that this is about settling the whole conflict militarily; they are not interested in a political solution it seems \u2013 that really is the message we have received from Russia. So, just to be clear: You're saying Russia has no interest in peace talks? In the last two months, Moscow was saying that they were looking for a ceasefire and a political process. We don't agree with Russia on the nature of the political process, but we were clear that there must be a political process coupled with a ceasefire, then we would come to the negotiating table. So, it would have been possible to start negotiating, but instead, we saw the air raids. So now, we see that the words we heard from Russia are in total contradiction to its behavior on the ground! The Russian airstrikes, in particular, are pushing back the opposition, which has been losing ground in recent months. Can you still win militarily? The balance of forces on the ground is obviously very unequal. We have three major forces fighting the Free Syrian Army: The Syrian army, Hezbollah and the militias from outside and from Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, you see some ten countries are contributing mercenaries to these militias, as well as Iranian and Russian forces. We are fighting three major forces with just the Free Syrian Army and the limited weapons we have. The misbalance is obvious to everyone! If you try to eliminate the Free Syrian Army, then you eliminate the political process, because you are eliminating the only moderate force committed to a diplomatic process. So the political impact is huge \u2013 as is the humanitarian impact: we're seeing huge numbers of people fleeing as the air raids continue. There is another force on the ground: The Kurdish forces\u2026 We have Kurdish forces fighting alongside the Free Syrian Army, but the main group \u2013 the PYD \u2013 does have military capabilities, but the problem is that sometimes they fight alongside the regime. So we cannot count on them as part of the opposition. They are opening fronts and helping out on the regime's side when it suits them and then, when it suits them again, they come and talk to the Free Syrian Army. Their agenda doesn't seem reconcilable with the Free Syrian Army. Is the HNC going to stick to its demand that, as a precondition to any talks, the regime has to grant humanitarian access to besieged towns and the end of airstrikes? The humanitarian obligations under international human rights law are very clear: the sieges and starvation of populations are war crimes, killings and torture in prisons are war crimes, the indiscriminate bombings of civilians are war crimes! We want all war crimes to stop \u2013 that is our precondition. A ceasefire is a different story \u2013 dual track ceasefire and political negotiations on the transitional governing body are acceptable to us. That's what we came to Geneva for. As soon as the war crimes end, we can start the actual negotiations on the ceasefire and the transitional governing body, that's clear. What are the next steps? We will wait for what the international partners discuss. We believe that the members of the UN Security Council are entitled to an explanation from Russia about why it torpedoed the process here. DW spoke to Bassma Kodmani, a member of the main opposition umbrella group, the Saudi-backed Syrian High Negotiations Committee, on the line from Geneva. The HNC has demanded that, as a precondition to talks, the regime allow humanitarian access to besieged towns, stop bombing civilians and release thousands of prisoners - some of them children - held in regime jails. This interview was conducted by Naomi Conrad.",

"story": "Lights out for the incandescent light bulb? The Dutch town of Eindhoven is where the Philips brothers first began mass-producing light bulbs. Today though, the company is pursuing technologies they say will make the good old light bulb a thing of the past. The Philips brothers began producing the first light bulbs in a small brick factory in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, in 1887. The site is now home to a museum, where visitors can find out everything about the history of lighting. During the daily guided tours, visitors can see, for example, how workers made the carbonized cotton thread filaments encased in a bulb of glass. Philips became the world's biggest maker of light bulbs, and it turned Eindhoven into a city of light. Today, the company continues to be a pioneer in the field of lighting. But new developments promise to make the old-fashioned light bulb go the way of the horse and cart. \"Its fate is sealed,\" said Niels Haverkorn, strategic marketing director for light at Philips. \"The future belongs to LED lights and OLED lights - semiconductor light from light diodes.\" Four big advantages In light-emitting diode or LED bulbs, more than 50 percent of the energy is converted into light. In the case of energy-saving light bulbs, only 25 percent is converted into light, while the normal light bulb converts just 5 percent. Another advantage is that, in addition to dimming the light, consumers can also choose the color of the light to suit a certain atmosphere. Turn on a sunny yellow light while vacuuming, for example, or cozy red to accompany the evening meal. For designers, the tiny LED light sources also open up new possibilities. They can be more flexible when experimenting with forms and materials for lamps. But perhaps most importantly, an LED lamp burns 50 times longer than a normal light bulb: 50,000 instead of a mere 1,000 hours. The table lamp from Philips' new Ledino series, for example, looks like a shiny silver high-tech oyster that's just starting to open. And the new Daywave desk lamp is packed with special features, says Haverkorn. \"It adjusts to the amount of daylight and doesn't disrupt people's biorhythms, so people can work more efficiently,\" he said. Surround lighting The next step will be OLED, an extension of LED technology (the 'O' stands for organic). Although it's still in the beginning stages, OLED technology has the ability to be embedded in fabric, meaning that your rug, sofa or curtains could be transformed into light sources. \"Lamps will become obsolete,\" said Haverkorn. \"Light will be more like daylight, it'll come from everywhere.\" First though, the estimated 24 billion lamps worldwide equipped with standard light bulb fixtures would have to be scrapped. And besides, LED technology, though quite advanced, is not perfect. It's still relatively expensive, and sometimes, it's not strong enough. To replace a 75-Watt light bulb, for example, you're still better off with an energy-saving bulb. They're now available in all sizes, with different lighting effects, including dimmers. Those who want to stick with the classic light bulb shape can now opt for the Philips Retrofit bulb. It still looks like the good old light bulb, it fits in all the old fixtures, but it gives off LED light. The cost is between 20 and 40 euros ($28 - $57). \"But for that, it's environmentally friendly, it gives off a wonderful, warm light, and it'll burn for 50 years!\" Haverkorn said.

"story": "Cooling interest in a warming Arctic? Ottawa in Canada is hosting a conference on \u201cArctic Change\u201d. With climate change making access to the Arctic easier, interest has increased. But the forecast boom in economic activity appears to have been put \"on ice\". The Arctic has been high on Canada's agenda over the past two years, with the country at the helm of the Arctic Council, the international body which regulates and coordinates what happens in the far north of the planet. As the country prepares to hand over the rotating presidency to the USA at the end of the year, the annual conference organized by the research network ArcticNet has aroused considerable interest, with more than 1200 leading international Arctic researchers, indigenous leaders, policy makers, NGOs and business people meeting in Ottawa to discuss the pressing issues facing the warming Arctic. Permafrost not so permanent? Hugues Lantuit from Germany's Alfred Wegener Institute is a member of the steering committee. The permafrost expert told DW with the latest IPCC report projecting the Arctic would continue to warm at a rate faster than any place on earth, the region had to prepare for greater impacts. While the retreat of sea ice allows easier access for shipping and more scope for commercial activities, Lantuit is concerned about the thawing of permafrost, a key topic at the Ottawa gathering: \u201cAn extensive part of the circumpolar north is covered with permafrost. Permafrost is frozen ground, and it's currently warming at a fast pace. A lot of cities are built on permafrost, and the layer that is thawing in the summer is expanding and getting deeper and deeper, which threatens infrastructure.\u201d Community concern People live in Arctic regions of Russia, Canada, Alaska and Svalbard, which belongs to Norway. Residents of northern communities are concerned about the impact of melting permafrost on railways, landing strips and buildings. Lantuit and his colleagues have created an integrated data base for permafrost temperature, with support from the EU. One aim of the meeting is to identify the priorities for research, taking into account the needs of communities and stakeholders in the Arctic. Another key issue on the Ottawa agenda is coastal erosion. Sea ice acts as a protective barrier to the coast, preventing waves from battering the shore and speeding up the thaw of permafrost. With decreasing sea ice in the summer, scientists expect more storms will impact on the coasts of the Arctic. \u201cIn some locations, especially in Alaska, we see much greater erosion than there was before\u201d, says Lantuit. This creates a lot of issues: \u201cThere is oil and gas infrastructure on the coast, villages, people, also freshwater habitats for migrating caribou, so the coast has a tremendous social and ecological value in the Arctic, and coastal erosion is obviously a threat to settlements and to the features of this social and economical presence in the Arctic.\" Biodiversity under threat Amongst the participants at the conference is George Divoky, an ornithologist who has spent every summer of the past 45 years on Cooper Island, off the coast of Barrow, in Arctic Alaska. Divoky monitors a colony of black guillemots that nest on the island in summer. His bird-watching project turned into a climate change observation project as he witnessed major changes in the last four decades: \u201cWarming first aided the guillemots (1970s and 1980) as the summer snow-free period increased. The size of the breeding colony increased during the initial stages of warming. Continued warming (1990s to present) caused the sea ice to rapidly retreat in July and August when guillemots are feeding nestlings, and the loss of ice reduced the amount and quality of prey resulting in widespread starvation of nestlings.\u201d The 2014 breeding season on Cooper Island had the lowest number of breeding pairs of Black Guillemots on the island in the last 20 years, Divoky says. Reduced sea ice is increasingly forcing polar bears to seek refuge on the island, eating large numbers of nestlings. Polar bears were rare visitors to the island until 2002. The Arctic and the global climate Divoky is in Ottawa to fit his research and experience into the wider context of climate impacts in the ArcticResearching climate change and its effects are important but of little practical use if the research does not inform government officials and result in policies that address the causes of climate change, Divoky argues. Hugues Lantuit says the UN climate conference currently going on in Peru is important for the Arctic, which, in its own right, influences the whole world climate: \u201cPermafrost contains a lot of what we call organic carbon, and that is stored in the upper part. And if that warms, the carbon is made available to microorganisms that convert it back to carbon dioxide and methane. And we estimate right now that there is twice as much organic carbon in permafrost as there is in the atmosphere\u201d. Lantuit says reducing emissions and reducing temperature is the only way to reduce the thaw of permafrost. But there is no clear mitigation strategy in terms of permafrost directly, he argues. \u201cYou would have to put a blanket over the entire permafrost in the northern hemisphere. This is not possible.\u201d What happened to the Arctic gold rush? Communities who live and companies that work in the Arctic have to focus on adaptation to the rapid change, says Lantuit. In his eyes, economic activity is increasing, posing new challenges for infrastructure and the environment. Malte Humpert, the Executive Director of the Arctic Institute, a non-profit think tank based in Washington DC has a different view on the matter. He says while attendance at Arctic conferences and interest in the Arctic is still high, commercial activity has actually been cooling off. \u201cWe are seeing a slow-down of investment. Up to this point there has been a lot of studying, a lot of interest being voiced, with representatives from China or South Korea, Japan, Singapore or other actors, arriving at conferences, speaking about grand plans. But up to this point a lot of the talk has been just that.\u201d A lot of activity has been put on hold, says Humpert. He says the \"gold rush mentality we saw a few years ago\u201d has weakened. \u201cThere was a lot of talk about Arctic shipping initially, then we had oil and gas activity in 2012, north of Alaska, then we had the discussion about minerals in Greenland. The question is now, with the oil price being down below 70$ a barrel, some political uncertainties over the Ukraine, involving the EU and Russia, how will that affect Arctic development?\u201d Humpert stresses the Arctic does not exist in a vacuum, but has to be seen within the global context. Sanctions on Russia because of the Ukraine crisis have created economic problems for Moscow and limited access to technology it might need for its Arctic activities. \u201cMaybe Arctic development has been oversold and overplayed and will be more of a niche operators' investment. One could definitely question if there will be this global push into the Arctic.\u201d Arctic development on ice Humpert is skeptical that any major development will take place before 2030. He says developing the infrastructure in terms of ports and communications in the remote Arctic region would require billions of dollars of investment, and would have to be a very long-term proposition. It will also depend to a large extent on exactly how climate change affects ice conditions in the Arctic. Climate change can make the climatic conditions in the Arctic more variable. This meansthat for a temporary period, there might even be more ice, which would block transport routes. The Arctic Institute says there has actually been a slow down this year in terms of navigation on the northern sea route (NSR) in particular: \"The season just closed about a week ago. Last year we had 1.35 million tonnes of cargo being transported along the NSR, this year we had less than 700,000 tonnes, so an almost 50% decrease, just because there was more ice in the way\", says Humpert. Whether slower development is good news or bad depends on your perspective. The lull in Arctic activity could pre-empt environmental degradation or destruction, says Humpert, and leave scope to consider development of the Arctic in what he calls a 21st century way. Instead of \u201cold-school\u201d thinking about extracting minerals, oil and gas and increasing shipping, there could be a focus on bringing modern, high-speed communications, fiber optics and thinking about renewables, such as wave energy. This would benefit the small populations in the Arctic, the expert argues. But from the viewpoint of a country like Russia, he adds, where 40 percent of your exports are generated above the Arctic circle, in terms of hydrocarbon resources, the slowdown in Arctic development because of the drop in oil prices and political tensions over Ukraine is very worrying. So while these developments seem to have brought the Arctic a breathing space, ultimately, the commercialization of the region could be just a matter of time. Ottawa conference organizer Lantuit argues that there has always been activity in the high North. The priority now, he says, must be to ensure international cooperation and additional investment in protecting the environment and maintaining safety in a region where rapid change seems to have become the status quo.",

A DIY vintage look and making a template are  pretty easy. We\u2019ll show you how to do it yourself. You\u2019ll need a piece of untreated wood. some cardboard in the same size s printout of the text you want steel wool from the hardware store vinegar coffee powder and hot water paint and a sponge a Boxcutter and work gloves. Instructions Glue your printed text onto the cardboard. Cut along the letters with the utility knife. Punch the all of the letters out of the cardboard. There\u2019s your template! Now we\u2019ll create the dye to give the wood a weathered, used look. Put the steel wool into a container and pour vinegar in until it\u2019s covered. If you have a cover, close the container. Pour hot water on the coffee and stir it. You can use instant coffee, too. Let the coffee and steel wool sit for a couple of days. The longer you wait, the darker the steel wool gets. Pour the two liquids together. Use the mix to paint the wood all over. Don\u2019t forget the edges! Don\u2019t worry the smell won\u2019t last long. Once it\u2019s dry, use a brush to remove the coffee grounds. Now center your template on the piece of wood. Use tape to fix it on the sides. If you have putty, use it to get an even firmer fit. If not, roll up some tape. Now use a sponge to dab the paint mix around the template. Go over the template several times. Be sure to press the template onto the wood firmly, so the dye doesn\u2019t seep. Remove the template and remove any tape or putty. There it is, you brand spanking new \u201cvintage\u201d sign. Good to know If you want your sign to look even older, pound on it with a hammer or put in a few nail holes. If you\u2019d like it to look more grey, leave out the coffee and just use the vinegar-steel wool mix.",

"story": "Gambian refugees in Germany react to crisis at home Gambian refugees across the world are following the political crisis in their home country with both apprehension and hope. DW's Daniel Pelz met some of them in Germany's capital Berlin.  General's hands were glued to his smartphone, even when he spoke. \"I am so scared. I am always thinking about Gambia, about what's happening next,\" the 30-year-old refugee from The Gambia said in a fast-paced voice. Like many of the estimated 14,500 Gambians in Germany, he has been anxiously waiting for a peaceful end to the political crisis at home. General is not his real name. While he sat in a small cafe in Berlin's Kreuzberg district, his thoughts always wandered back to his family at home. \"I call my brother every day after waking up to ask if everything is okay. And at night I go online and read what news is there. Sometimes I don't even sleep. I just have to read what is happening,\" he said. His younger brothers have already fled The Gambia. Like some 45,000 other Gambians, they have crossed the border into neighboring Senegal. WhatsApp connections General showed me a video on his smartphone where people are standing beside a country road, clapping and shouting while armored vehicles drive by. It's said to show Senegalese troops entering The Gambia, but that's impossible to verify. Messages kept popping up on his screen. Through WhatsApp, Gambians like General are struggling to stay in touch with friends and relatives. Even some Gambian soldiers he went to school with are sending him messages. \"I just wonder what's next. We have never experienced war. We never had a situation like this since I was born,\" he said. \"Everybody is very excited. They all hope that change will finally come,\" said Brigitta Varadinek. She's the founder of Bantabaa, an association which provides legal advice, training courses and German language classes for Gambian refugees in Berlin. Even after the Gambian President Yahya Jammeh backtracked on his original promise to accept defeat after elections last December prompting the current stand-off, many of the Gambian refugees in Germany have remained hopeful, Varadinek said. \"We were very afraid and pessimistic about what would happen next, but they remained optimistic and said now he has to step down. Of course they were afraid for their families, but they kept being optimistic. I think in the end they will be right, change will come,\" she said. Hope remains That's what 42-year-old Carlos (not his real name) also desperately has been hoping for. \"I tried to call my family yesterday and also this morning and did not get them. I was very confused,\" Carlos said as he clinched his left fist. \"I am so afraid, because Jammeh does not want to step down.\" Three years ago he fled Gambia because of President Jammeh's draconian regime. \"You could not say what you wanted to say, you could not do, what you wanted to do. Whatever you do, the government would come to you, beat you, put you into prison. It was very hard for me. I do not like this government of Jammeh,\" he said. More messages have arrived from The Gambia. Some people there were already celebrating because they were convinced that the ECOWAS troops would oust President Jammeh. On another video, a crowd cheered and clapped in front of the chief of staff of Gambia's army. He was announcing that the army would not fight against the foreign soldiers. But Carlos could not breathe easily just yet. \"I am still afraid, until I hear that they have caught Jammeh or that he is gone. When I hear that Jammeh has gone or Jammeh has been caught, I will be happy for that,\" he said.",

As thousands of people gathered on Monday evening for a vigil to mourn those killed and injured in the terror attack, you could both sense and hear that Manchester spirit. \"Mancunians and Manchester has always been a city based on people standing together, and not being divided,\" Mark Beatty told me as he prepared to listen to the words of the Manchester mayor and others addressing the crowds. \"And we will not allow terrorism to divide us. That's why we brought our three children with us today.\" Changing things for the better Mark Beatty had brought his three young daughters of primary school age - like so many of those attending the Ariana Grande concert the evening before had been. I sensed he wanted to show them what this city was made of. Abid Hussein had also made his way to the vigil along with a group of friends, and expressed the same hopes as so many of those gathered around him. \"I'm hoping that this will change things for the better, I'm hoping that this will bring the citizens of Manchester together whether they be black, white, yellow, whether they be Jew, Christian Muslim, Hindu or Sikh.\" On edge But even though the center of Manchester felt like it was bouncing back to a sense of normality that evening, with people spilling out onto the pavements of pubs and bars in the warm May sunshine, there was clearly an edge to it all. Armed police gave a sense of increased safety, but were also a reminder of what had happened, and what might still happen. A few hours earlier I got caught up in the frantic evacuation of the Arndale Center - a huge, sprawling shopping mall in the city center. People panicked when police moved in to arrest a man on matters unrelated to the terror attack, and started running for the exits. I ran with them, suddenly feeling utterly helpless, scared and angry that this is what people in this and so many other European cities have now come to expect. Read more: Britain's PM Theresa May condemns 'worst of humanity' Standing together With the immediate aftermath of the 2011 Oslo and Ut\u00f8ya terror attacks in mind, I had spent the morning carefully avoiding drawing any conclusions of Islamist terror being behind the attack on people inside the Manchester Arena. Then the \"Islamic State\" (IS) group claimed responsibility. Soon after the identity of the bomber became known - a Manchester-born British citizen and son of Libyans who fled Moammar Gadhafi in the 1980s. What now for Manchester's sizeable Muslim population? Would there be a backlash, as has been seen elsewhere in Western cities in the aftermath of IS-claimed terror? \"I stand before you on behalf of the entire Old Trafford Muslim society,\" Imam Yusuf Chunara from the Old Trafford Jame'ah E Noor mosque told me outside Manchester Town Hall. He, and many others from a range of different faiths, had come to stand together against the terror which had struck their city. \"It's terrifying, it's horrible, that someone would want to do something like this to innocent people just enjoying themselves. These acts are highly against Islam and we highly condemn it,\" he said. Few point finger at Islam \"Everyone's got this fear inside. We teach and promote peace, it's a matter of humanity. And we're also here to show our support to the police and all those people who have helped those who have been affected,\" said Chunara. Manchester's Muslim population is diverse, and to generalize about a group of people based on their religion feels senseless - no less so as a reaction to a heinous act carried out by someone purporting to belong to that same religion. Yet there will always be those pointing a finger at Islam in the aftermath of terrorism performed by people who say they do it in the name of that religion. Read more: Madrid to Manchester: A chronology of terror in Europe Responsibility rests with the criminal Two days after the attack it looks as if Manchester is dusting itself off, getting ready to move on. Questions still remain around how a young individual could be radicalized to the extent of deciding to attack children and young people in the very city he himself grew up in. As people kept bringing flowers to the square in front of Town Hall on Wednesday, the consensus seemed to be that the responsibility for his actions were his and those of any fellow perpetrators, and cannot be laid on the shoulders of any one community. Meanwhile, for me and for my fellow Mancunians, the saddest thing today is the realization that for the children growing up here today, such a senseless attack is something they can expect to happen again.",

"story": "UN expert: Torture and abuse 'widespread' in Turkey following July coup bid The UN's Nils Melzer has said that torture and other forms of ill-treatment seem to have been widespread following the failed coup attempt. The findings echo previous claims from leading rights groups. The UN's special rapporteur on torture, Nils Melzer, told reporters in Ankara on Friday that measures taken in Turkey following the July coup attempt had created an \"environment conducive to torture.\" \"Testimonies received from inmates and their lawyers suggest that in the days and weeks following the failed coup torture and other forms of ill treatment were widespread,\" he said. Melzer's made the comments after a six-day tour of Turkey to investigate allegations of torture. His visit comes one month after US watchdog Human Rights Watch (HRW) accused Turkish police of torturing detainees arrested in connection with coup attempt. The UN rapporteur also cautioned that Turkey's prisons and holding cells were often overcrowded: \"Most facilities visited were overcrowded, with occupancy ranging from 125 to more than 200 per cent of the actual capacity.\" However, Melzer also noted that, after visiting facilities in Ankara, Diyarbakir, Sanliura and Istanbul, the overall conditions were generally satisfactory. Recent legislation and statutory decrees passed by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had created a \"climate of intimidation,\" he said, discouraging victims from filing complaints or speaking out about their abuse. \"Holding cells, currently keeping individuals for up 30 days without any access to fresh air, are not suitable to detain anyone for more than 48 hours,\" Melzer said. Sweeping security measures adopted as part of Turkey's state of emergency, which was extended by 12 weeks in October, mean that people are held in custody without judicial review for up to 30 days and without access to a lawyer for five days, according to Melzer. \"Worldwide experience shows us that it is precisely in the first hours and days after arrest that the risk of abuse, including torture and other forms of ill-treatment, is highest,\" he said, urging the Turkish government to live up its declared \"zero-tolerance\" policy on torture. Turkey's post-coup crackdown Since July, more than 100,000 people in the judiciary, military, media, civil service and education sector have been detained, dismissed or suspended. Most of them are accused of some connection to the coup attempt, which the government blames on followers of Fethullah Gulen, a US-based preacher. Around 37,000 people remain under arrest, some of whom claim to have been tortured, according to human rights groups. Just over a week after the coup bid, human rights NGO Amnesty International said it had \"credible evidence\" of detainees suffering abuses and torture. \"Ahead of the coup we were already receiving very serious reports of torture and ill-treatment, mostly in the southeast of Turkey,\" Amnesty International's Turkey researcher, Andrew Gardner, said. \"But what we saw after the violent coup attempt of July 15 was an explosion in the number of cases.\" There is also concern that opposition groups are being targeted, including Kurdish groups and independent media outlets. Erdogan has justified the purge as targeting terrorism. Concerns over human rights abuses have damaged relations with the European Union. In November, the European Parliament voted in favor of freezing membership talks with Turkey. Turkey's Ministry of Justice did not immediately respond to Melzer's comments. However, last month it responded to the HRW report, saying \"there is not even a small doubt that all the allegations of maltreatment or torture are being actively investigated by an independent and objective judiciary.\" Other Turkish officials have dismissed allegations made by rights groups as propaganda. dm/msh (AP, dpa, AFP)",

"story": "Gap Growing Between Poor and Rich A government-commissioned report on the rich-poor divide has found that poverty is on the rise in Germany and that the state might in fact be exacerbating it. The gap between the rich and poor in Germany has drastically increased since 1998 when the ruling coalition government of Social Democrats and Greens took over from its conservative predecessors. That's the core finding of a draft study commissioned by Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's government and released on Thursday. The draft report minces no words. Poverty is on the rise in what is still considered to be one of the richest countries in the world, it says. Children worst affected The situation is particularly drastic in Germany\u2019s big cities where children are among those worst affected in families with either lower incomes and reduced subsidies or suffering from long-term unemployment. 5 percent of the households concerned have to make do with less than 60 percent of average earnings, which is generally accepted by social scientists in the western world as the definition of poverty. This means that these households have fewer than \u20ac938 ($1,269) a month at their disposal. 15 percent of children up to 14 years of age are registered as being poor, and 19 percent of young people between 14 and 19 years of age. German social scientist Klaus Hurrelmann maintains that families and particularly single-parent households are not adequately supported by the state. \"The social situation of many children is getting worse,\" he said. \"Of course the problems that children in rich Germany face cannot be compared to those of children in the developing world. However, the psychological pressure cannot be overlooked.\" \"Government making people poorer\" Faced with an ageing population and an overburdened welfare system as a result, the coalition government of Social Democrats and Greens has set out to overhaul mechanisms of granting benefits for the needy. Of the measures to come into effect as of January next year will be the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits at a low level which will see a good proportion of people, first and foremost the long-term unemployed, in an even greater financial plight. Barbara Stolterfoht, head of the country\u2019s welfare umbrella organization, predicts poverty levels going up even further as a result. \"The merging of social and unemployment benefits is a good idea, not a bad one,\" she said. \"But, merging this on the level of social benefits which is very low and which means poverty is a bad idea.\" Stolterfoht said poverty was bound to be the final outcome. \"What this government is doing is just making people poorer without giving them work.\" It's a view shared by Walter Hanesch, a professor of social sciences in Darmstadt. He reckons that with an ongoing polarization in society more unrest is programmed. essence this means that we\u2019re drifting more and more towards a greater potential of social unrest in the country, he said. \"It\u2019ll be interesting to see what impact the government\u2019s social reforms will have in 2005.\" Hanesch contended that the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits will not be conducive to reducing poverty levels. \"On the contrary, some of the poorest \u2013 particularly the long-term unemployed \u2013 will even get poorer.\u201d Rich getting richer? While more and more people have to turn over every cent, there\u2019s also an increasing number of people at the other side of the spectrum who can afford to spend money like water. 10 percent of people with the highest earnings now account for almost half of all net incomes in the country. Some 1.6 million Germans own at least half a million euros each, and an unspecified number can proudly call themselves billionaires.",

"story": "UK court rules WikiLeaks' Assange should be extradited to Sweden A British court has ruled that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange should be extradited to Sweden where he faces charges of sexual abuse and rape. Assange's lawyer said he would appeal the ruling. A UK court ruled on Thursday that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange can be extradited to Sweden where he faces charges of sexual abuse and rape. Assange has denied the allegations, and his lawyers said they would appeal the ruling. The defense team argued that the charges were not offenses worthy of extradition and that the Swedish prosecution had no power to issue the European arrest warrant. They also expressed concern whether the 39-year old would be granted a fair trial in Sweden. The lawyers criticized Sweden for seeking to extradite the controversial Internet activist before formally charging him with any crime. They also said the sexual assault allegations against their client did not constitute rape under European law. \"What is rape in Swedish law does not amount to rape in any other country,\" said defense lawyer Geoffrey Robinson. Swedish authorities have said that last year Assange had sex with one woman without a condom while she was asleep, and he had sex with another woman with a broken condom. Such actions are punishable under Swedish law. From Sweden to the US? Australian national Assange said the accusations were politically motivated. He claims that Sweden might hand him over to the United States. His lawyers have said he might face imprisonment at Guantanamo Bay or even the death penalty if he is prosecuted for his part in the publication of classified US documents by WikiLeaks. Australia has called on Sweden to make sure that Assange gets a fair hearing. Australia's ambassador to Sweden, Paul Stephens, said his government expects the case will proceed \"with due process and the provisions prescribed under Swedish law.\" WikiLeaks caught the world's attention with the publication of thousands of secret US reports on the war in Afghanistan last summer. Since then, it has remained in the public eye with similar reports on the war in Iraq and the gradual release of some 250,000 secret US diplomatic cables.

"story": "Icelandic activist: 'Turkey is the last place refugees want to go' Chios is one of five hotspots in Greece where refugees are being imprisoned until they get shipped off to Turkey. DW spoke to the activist and blogger Benjamin Julian about the precarious situation. DW: How long have you been on the island of Chios? Benjamin Julian: I've been here for two weeks now. I came here on the day the Turkish deal went into effect. How many helpers are still there? It's a little bit hard to estimate. There are two or three soup kitchens, Soli Caf\u00e9 and local solidarity groups which also called for protests at the detention center last Thursday. There is also staff of UNHCR here. Are any other large human rights organizations present? There is also a person from Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch might be sending someone and the Norwegian refugee council was here as well. The presence is not as big in Chios, partly because a lot of them pulled out when the hotspot regime started. What can you tell us about the situation of prisoners escaping from the Hotspot on Friday? There is a long experience in Chios of having the refugees in open facilities. This system seemed to have little trouble. Since the closed camps have started after the Turkish deal, the mood soured a lot, and it's not just because there are closed camps now, although that is a big reason for it, I would say it is at least as much because they are told when they arrive at the closed camps that the idea is to deport them. They know that a million people went to Europe last year and now suddenly they are the first group who is not allowed in. So then the local solidarity groups called for a protest on Thursday. While they were protesting outside, the people inside were also protesting which they have been doing daily. They broke out of the prison while the protests were ongoing. In the end they went back inside, but were determined to break out again, which they did. Partly out of immense frustration at the humiliating way they were being treated. And partly because they feel they are being kept in a prison where the guards are not even able to keep them in. I assume all the people you have talked to are against going to Turkey? Oh yes, definitely. That is the least of all places they want to go to. Some Syrians would rather go to Syria than go to Turkey. Some would rather be in Greece than be deported to Turkey and many say that neither is an option. Those are the two options Europe is offering them. Most of them want to go to Northern Europe. [Many refugees, meanwhile, have now applied for asylum in Greece, hoping to stay in Europe, the Ed.] Which refugees are able to apply for asylum in Greece? The whole asylum history has been a fiasco from the beginning. The first days the policemen didn't even know what do to with asylum requests. A few days in they just started saying that it would happen and that they would sort of accept your name on a list, a list of people wanting asylum, but they couldn't do anything about it. And when the agreement finally came, it was semi-broken and had several problems. It was just a big dilemma everybody expected to happen. This is what you get when you want to create a revolution in an asylum system that is supposed to happen in two days. It's impossible, it's not doable. Since then people have been applying for asylum and they are supposed to get interviews, but I don't know if anyone actually had one yet. One person in the camp told me this morning that some of the people who just got deported applied for asylum, but did not get an interview. I don't know if it is confirmed, but it sounds to me like the fiasco is not over. There is still not a solid system about asylum processing and it is not being done in an effective way. So yesterday, you saw the first boat leaving for Turkey. Do you know how fast the deportation is going to go now? Yes, the first boat left in the morning, earlier than expected, just after sunrise. The idea is to deport everyone. Boats are expected to come daily, at least in the next three days. There are very few cases that will get asylum here because of conditions uncertain. If they can show that they are being persecuted in Turkey, but there we are talking about a handful of people. All the other thousands are supposed to apply for asylum or anything close to that once they are in Turkey. However, I am not sure if Turkey will offer that to them. It seems to me that Europe is just going along with the scheme, no matter what the legal background to it is. I think the European Union is doing this to send a message to refugees who are thinking about coming. How difficult is it to speak to people over the fence? It is hard, because the police doesn't really allow it. If you get caught, you risk spending a few hours at the police station. But I've done it a few times, less and less actually. What is the food and hygiene situation like in the hotspots? It is bad, but it is definitely not what frustrates them the most. How long are you going to stay there? I will stay for a few more days, but I might go to Turkey now to see what things are like on the other end. I was there before but now I am curious to see what happens next.

"story": "Berlin's ex-finance chief probed for controversial immigrant remarks Thilo Sarazzin, Berlin's outspoken ex-finance chief who sparked outrage by making disparaging remarks about the capital's Arab and Turkish populations, is being investigated for suspicions of inciting racial hatred. A spokesman for the state prosecutor's office in Berlin said on Friday that investigators were looking into comments made by Sarrazin in an interview this week, criticizing certain immigrant groups in the German capital for not being productive enough. \"The authorities are examining whether the transcript of the interview crossed limits on free speech and whether there are initial suspicions for a crime,\" the spokesman told news agency AP. Sarrazin, an executive board member of Germany's federal bank, the Bundesbank, told magazine Lettre International that Berlin's large Arab and Turkish populations were unwilling to integrate and worsened the city's considerable economic problems. \"A large number of Arabs and Turks in this city, whose number has grown through bad policies, have no productive function other than as fruit and vegetable vendors,\" Sarrazin, 64, told the quarterly magazine. Citing Berlin's high jobless rate compared to the national average, he said part of the city's problems lay in the fact that 40 percent of births were among the \"lower class\". He also took aim at what he called a \"slob factor\" in the capital. \"I do not need to accept people who live on handouts from a state they reject and who are not adequately concerned about the education of their children, and constantly produce new, little headscarf-clad girls,\" he said. \"That goes for 70 percent of the Turkish and 90 percent of the Arab population of Berlin.\" Far-right party applauds comments The comments have triggered a storm of outrage across Germany. \"This is outrageous,\" Kenan Kolat, who heads the Turkish Association in Germany, told news agency dpa. Uwe Foullong of the Ver.di trade union called the comments \"scandalous\" and \"extreme right-wing.\" Sarrazin, a member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), also faces calls for his expulsion. \"After these comments, Thilo Sarrazin can no longer be tolerated in the party,\" Eva Hoegl, a SDP member of the Berlin state parliament told newspaper Rheinische Post. Gerhard Schick, a parliamentarian from the Green Party told the newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau that Sarrazin had damaged the reputation of the Bundesbank with his controversial comments and had clearly violated the bank's rules of conduct. The Bundesbank issued a statement saying it distanced itself resolutely from Sarrazin's \"discriminatory remarks.\" Sarrazin said in a statement on Thursday he regrets the comments and did not mean to insult anyone. His remarks have however been applauded by the far-right NPD party. The party said that Berlin's former finance chief \"had hit the nail on the head when it came to Germany's development as a country.\" No stranger to controversy It's not the first time Sarrazin has stirred controversy with his outspoken comments which earned him the nickname \"Rambo.\" The belligerent 64-year-old established a reputation for criticizing the habits and slovenliness of Berlin's lower class during his seven-year term in political office in the city. At one point, he complained about people wandering the streets all day in jogging pants, and his department published a document demonstrating that the unpopular unemployment benefit known as Hartz IV still provided more than enough money for a well-balanced diet. sp/AP/dpa Editor: Andreas Illmer",

"story": "'High time' for medical marijuana in Germany The federal government wants to make cannabis more accessible to sick Germans as a means for pain relief, according to the country's drug representative. 'High time,' say supporters of legalization. \"It is our goal that in the future more people in Germany will be able to receive cannabis as medicine than has been the case until now,\" Marlene Mortler, the federal government's drug representative said on Tuesday, adding that plans were in the making for legislation that would see insurance companies cover the costs. \"We want to get this law through the Bundestag [lower house of German parliament] by the end of the year so it can take effect in 2016,\" Mortler said in an interview published in the Welt daily. Medicine and politics - and law \"The case until now\" has been that only very few receive cannabis as part of medical treatments. At present, less than 300 Germans are authorized to purchase marijuana in pharmacies, almost exclusively those suffering from terminal cancer, according to the federal health ministry. Mortler conceded that it \"indeed remains not very easy\" to differentiate those who are in dire need of cannabis from those who are not. The issue, she claimed, was of a political nature. \"Our politicians need to provide clarity here in swift fashion.\" With regard to the accessibility of medical marijuana, however, the issue is more than just medical or political. Last July, three people went to a district court in Cologne to complain they couldn't afford to purchase medical marijuana from local pharmacies. Even with explicit authorization, the plaintiffs said they were still not able to obtain the drugs, and they asked the court to be allowed to grow their own plants. In an unprecedented ruling, the court said yes. For critically ill patients allowed to purchase cannabis in pharmacies, a gram officially costs between 15 and 18 euros, according to Germany's Federal Chamber of Pharmacists. Legalization, trivialization? Mortler made no mistake in her Welt interview - which was picked up by most mainstream media and garnered significant attention on Twitter - that the possession and usage of marijuana for Germans without medical authorization remained against the law. \"I can only emphasize that regular use, particularly for young people, is damaging \u2026 It robs them of energy they need to stay fit in life, and we know that it can lead to psychoses and phases in which their entire lives revolve around getting high. Statements for the legalization of cannabis threaten to trivialize these dangers,\" implored Mortler, with regard to a popular campaign supported by leading Green party politician Cem \u00d6zdemir. \u00d6zdemir, who heads the Greens on the federal level, told DW in response to Mortler's interview that it was \"about time that the federal government is willing to make use of the medical advantages of cannabis.\" His praise ended there, however: \"But that shouldn't take a year to happen. It is preposterous that many patients are thus deprived of relief - this is a form of failing to render assistance.\" 'High time' \u00d6zdemir became a public champion for the legalization movement this past summer when he posted a video to Youtube in which he dumped a bucket of water on his head in support of ALS research. Saying nothing of the plant standing right next to him while responding to the \"ice bucket\" challenge, and although only half of it could be seen, it was clearly marijuana. An investigation was launched after \u00d6zdemir's parliamentary immunity was lifted in mid January, but the charges were dropped on Tuesday. \u00d6zdemir chose not to comment on the investigation that had been dropped, opting instead to talk about the importance of legalization with regard to \"effective ways to protect minors.\" \"The clearance of medical marijuana is only half of the issue. The protection of minors cannot be achieved by prohibition or the criminalization of users. Making cannabis illegal is no form of protection - the black market doesn't ask for identification or the age of the buyer,\" \u00d6zdemir said. For ordinary citizens, German law currently forbids the possession, cultivation and sale of marijuana, though the drug can be consumed legally. In most German federal states, despite being illegal, possession of up to six grams is not prosecuted. In Berlin, that amount is 15 grams.",

"story": "Spain mourns victims of Germanwings crash Three days of mourning are under way in Spain following Tuesday's Germanwings plane crash as relatives of 35 Spanish victims prepare to visit the crash site in the French Alps. Nik Martin reports from Barcelona. Spain held a minute's silence at noon on Wednesday for the victims of the Germanwings plane crash. The occasion was marked at Barcelona's El Prat airport where dozens of staff, passengers and reporters paid their respects to the 150 people on board the ill-fated airliner. A similar commemoration was held at the regional headquarters of the Spanish Professional Football League (LFP) and at Barcelona's Gran Teatre del Liceu, where two of the plane's victims - opera singers Oleg Bryjak and Maria Radner - had recently performed Richard Wagner's Siegfried. In the capital Madrid, both houses of Parliament and several government offices stopped for a minute of reflection. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy flew to France with Catalan president Artur Mas on Wednesday and was due to visit the crash site later in the day. Three days of national mourning were declared and across the country, flags were lowered to half-mast at many public buildings. Shocked and traumatized In hotels close to Barcelona airport, the Red Cross is helping to provide psychological support to relatives of those killed in Tuesday's crash. Family members have been giving DNA samples to help identify the victims' remains. \"We have teams working three shifts - about 175 people - a lot of people are visiting hotels and homes in the Barcelona area giving psychological support,\" Oscar Velasco from Cruz Roja Espanola told DW. The Red Cross is assisting as many as 60 families, including nationals from Germany, Turkey and Morocco as well as Spain. They have doctors, counselors and translators to help those bereaved. \"It is huge task helping families come to terms with this personal shock and it's important to maintain their privacy so they can begin the process of accepting the situation,\" added Velasco. Spain is liaising with French officials to organize a relatives' trip to the crash site, and the Red Cross thinks that will happen in the next day or two. Local media report that several families have already driven themselves to the French Alps, attempting to get as close as possible to the scene of the accident. 'Was it someone we know?' As the country began three days of mourning, several Barcelona residents described their disbelief at hearing of the tragedy. \"I immediately thought of my friends in Germany, and my sister called me in tears, knowing that I was due to fly any day, to check I was safe,\" Andres Aguinaga told DW. Another resident Manuel Leon said his family was stunned: \"We have friends who work in Germany and they regularly fly back and forth. We immediately thought 'Were they on the plane?'\" he said. Counselors have also been brought in to help students at a high school in Llinars del Valles. Many of them have been left traumatized by the deaths of 16 German schoolchildren who had been visiting the tiny Catalan town as part of an exchange program. On Tuesday evening, hundreds of them attended a memorial Mass for the victims at a church in the town, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Barcelona. With many Germans owning second homes in Spain and thousands of Spanish working in Germany due to the country's financial crisis, some Barcelona residents said the relationship between the two countries made the crash an even more significant tragedy.",

"story": "Continental denies responsibility for crash as Concorde trial begins US airline Continental denied responsibility for a deadly Concorde crash that spelt the end of supersonic travel as its mechanics went on trial in France on Tuesday. The accused face five years in jail. Judge Dominique Andreassier opened the trial by reading out the names of the 113 people who died in 2000 when the Air France jet smashed into a hotel in a ball of fire just after take-off from Paris Charles de Gaulle airport. She then read out the charges against the US airline Continental and two of its technical staff who are accused of the manslaughter of 109 people on the plane - most of them German tourists - and four hotel workers on the ground. \"There is an attempt to protect the Concorde and the image that it projected of France,\" said Continental lawyer Olivier Metzner as he arrived at the court in Pontoise, near Paris. Suspected six John Taylor, a welder who worked for Continental at the time of the crash and his supervisor, Stanley Ford, face involuntary manslaughter charges. Henri Perrier, the head of testing of the Concorde programme before becoming its director and Jacques Herubel, the plane's former chief engineer, are also accused. The sixth defendant is the former head of France's civil aviation body Claude Frantzen. Continental faces a maximum fine of 375,000 euros ($525,000) if found guilty. The individuals, who all deny the charges, face up to five years in jail and a fine of up to 75,000 euros. Small metal strip The court will decide whether to agree with the findings of a 2004 accident enquiry which concluded the crash was caused by a 43-centimeter (17-inch) strip of metal that fell off a Continental DC-10 that took off shortly before the Concorde on July 25, 2000. The Concorde, carrying nine French crew and mainly German passengers heading to New York to board a Caribbean cruise ship, ran over the super-hard titanium strip, it said. The strip shredded a tyre, causing a blow-out and sending debris flying into an engine and a fuel tank and setting it on fire, according to investigators. Metzner disputes these findings. \"Are you going to ask me to believe that this object could have caused the crash?\" Metzner told the court as he held up a metal strip similar to the one retrieved from the pile of debris the Concorde was reduced to after the crash. Metzner promised to present witnesses - including firemen based at the airport - who would testify that the New York-bound plane was on fire well before it reached the metal strip. Most of the families of the people who died in the crash agreed not to take legal action in exchange for compensation from Air France, the EADS aerospace firm, Continental and Goodyear tyre maker. But the mammoth criminal trial is expected to last four months and cost more than three million euros ($4.2 million). Illustrious history that ended in tragedy The Paris disaster was the first and only Concorde crash, but during their 27 years of service for Air France and British Airways, the jets suffered dozens of tyre blowouts or wheel damage that in several cases pierced fuel tanks. The Concorde made its maiden commercial flight in 1976. Only 20 were made, six for development and the remaining 14 for flying mainly trans-Atlantic routes at speeds of up to 1,350 miles (2,170 kilometers) an hour. Air France and BA grounded their Concordes for 15 months after the crash and, after a brief resumption, finally ended the world's only supersonic commercial service in 2003. glb/AFP/Reuters Editor: Andreas Illmer",

"story": "Germany's social mobility among poorest worse than in the United States \u2014 OECD A typical poor child in Germany would need 180 years to reach the average German income, while one in the United States would need 150 to reach the average US income. The OECD says that needs to change. Children in low-income families in Germany tend to have a harder time moving up the social ladder than children in equivalent circumstances in other industrialized countries, according to a new study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The study used earnings data across different generations to calculate the estimated amount of time it would take a child to reach the average income in a given country. Read more: What holds you back? What keeps you going? In Germany, it would take a child whose parents' earnings are in the bottom 10 percent of the population six generations or 180 years to reach the average national income. The average across the entire OECD, a group of 37 industrialized countries, is five generations. Children in low-income families in Denmark would need two generations, while children in the United States would need five generations. \"Fewer people at the bottom have moved up while the richest have largely kept their fortunes,\" the OECD said. \"This has severe social, economic and political consequences.\" Read more: German education fails to boost social mobility Schools and tax system at fault The Paris-based organization blamed Germany's child care policies, education system and tax code for the country's poor social mobility score. Compared to families in other OECD countries, German parents tend not to put their young children in child care or enroll them in full-day schooling. Both give young children from disadvantaged backgrounds an opportunity to develop early cognitive skills that help them climb the social ladder later in life. Read more: Income inequality 'too great' say 9 out of 10 people in Germany The \"tracking\" of school children \u2014 funneling some students to more academic secondary schools and others to vocational schools \u2014 in Germany tends to make it harder for children to move up and down the social ladder. Germany's tax system also tends to allow high concentrations of wealth to pass from one generation to the next through generous exemptions for wealthier families. In response, the OECD said Germany should invest more in child care, postpone the tracking of school children and reform its tax code to promote intergenerational mobility. \"Too many people feel they are being left behind and their children have too few chances to get ahead,\" OECD Chief of Staff Gabriela Ramos said. \"We need to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to succeed, especially the most disadvantaged.\" Read more: Fight wealth inequality with taxes says World Inequality Report",

"story": "Musharraf announces return to Pakistani politics despite Taliban threat Former President Pervez Musharraf has said he wants to \"free\" Pakistan from terrorism when he returns to the country after years in exile. He also criticized the 2011 US operation to kill Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. On Sunday, Musharraf will fly into Karachi, his hometown and Pakistan's largest city. With 18 million people, Karachi is suffering from record levels of violence linked to ethnic and political tensions. He plans to contest May's elections. \"In my time, Pakistan was an emerging country with a budding economy, and terrorism was not as big a problem as it is now,\" Musharraf told the German news magazine Der Spiegel. \"Success in these two political areas is the key to a stable and healthy Pakistan.\" Musharraf faces charges over the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto; the 2006 death of the Baluch rebel leader Akbar Bugti in a military operation, and the 2007 sacking and illegal arrest of judges. However, legal problems are only one challenge facing Musharraf: The Taliban have warned they have an assassination team ready to kill the one-time military strongman if he sets foot in the country. He brushed the threats off, though: \"In the last 12 years, terrorists have often tried to drive me into hell. Without success.\" \"They won't manage in the future either ...\" Musharraf said. \"Fortune favors the brave.\" 'A total failure' The former army chief of staff, Musharraf seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999 and left the country after stepping down in August 2008, when Bhutto's widower, Asif Ali Zardari, was elected president. \"The last five years ... were a total failure,\" Musharraf said, adding that \"all the economic and social indicators showed that Pakistan was a developing country\" before his self-imposed exile. \"I want to put Pakistan on the road to prosperity and free it from terrorism,\" Musharraf said in the interview, published online Saturday. Musharraf also said that the killing of the al Qaeda leader bin Laden was \"certainly a success but a success that Pakistani security forces could have achieved.\" He added that \"no country has the right to violate the sovereignty of another like the US did there.\" mkg/mr (Reuters, AFP, dpa, AP)",

"story": "Why Little Red Riding Hood is caught between innocence and sexuality Is Little Red Riding Hood just a naive little girl? Only in the tale by the German Brothers Grimm. In older versions of the story, she flirts and the wolf seduces her. Here's a look at various Little Red Riding Hoods. Little Red Riding Hood has always put me off - that dumb, innocent little girl who surrenders to the big bad wolf, only to be devoured by him. And then there's the manly, courageous hunter who heroically rescues her and her grandmother by cutting them out of the wolf's belly. And of course, though it defies logic, they both emerge totally unharmed. Obviously, the Brothers Grimm didn't mind the inconsistencies in the story. They were more interested in scaring children. They wanted to teach kids good behavior: Listen to your mother and don't talk to strangers. But today we would call that xenophobia and cowardice. Nevertheless, when I heard about an exhibition exclusively about Little Red Riding Hood, I was curious. What is it about the fairytale girl that can fill an entire exhibition? The Bilderbuchmuseum - the picture book museum - in Troisdorf is housed in a red manor house in a small town close to Bonn and holds Europe's largest collection on the Little Red Riding Hood. Dozens of girls with red hoods reside side by side over two floors in the house. On the ground floor of the museum, there is a play area for young visitors. Through a crack in the door, I see a child dressed as Little Red Riding Hood whistling and walking around paper trees. Upstairs, the exhibition is more geared toward adults. There is no artificial forest there, but only display cases with books and pictures on the walls. It's not particularly creative. The many faces of Little Red Riding Hood In each display case, a different Little Red Riding Hood encounters a different wolf - and not all of the images are G-rated. As curator Bernhard Schmitz tells me, the unusual collection was given to the museum by a Swiss couple. For over 30 years, Elisabeth and Richard Waldmann collected Little Red Riding Hoods wherever they went, gathering 800 books written since the end of the 18th century, as well as countless dolls, puppets, toys, flatware, ads, and all kinds of knickknacks. How on earth can anyone be so obsessed with a fairytale figure? Looking through the wooden display cases looking for the Little Red Riding Hood that I know - the sweet dumb little girl - I come across many others sitting next to her. One of them has bare breasts. Another one has a Mohawk, and yet another looks quite lascivious. Still others are wicked or sardonic. This girl seems to have many different faces. An erotic fairytale The very first one, the French \"Petit Chaperon Rouge\" is anything but innocent. An adolescent, she obviously enjoys alluring the wolf. And when he invites her to come to bed with his (\"Viens te coucher avec moi\"), she undresses and lies down naked next to the beguiling wolf. Clearly a case of coquettish seduction. Then I notice a comic from the 1990s depicting an erotic version of Little Red Riding Hood. Obviously, the sexual aspect of the original tale hasn't gotten lost over time, despite the prudishness of the prudish Brothers Grimm. An entire room in the picture book museum has been devoted to artist Burgi K\u00fchnemann and her very special Little Red Riding Hoods. She is standing in front one of her works - a hunter's vest with numerous pockets filled with booklets. \"The wolf is a traffic victim\" is written on the dirty green fabric. Little Red Riding Hood and the Nazis Burgi K\u00fchneman takes a booklet from her right breast pocket. In it, a youthful Little Red Riding Hood is sitting behind the steering wheel, about to run over the poor wolf. \"Once there was a report about a wolf that got run over on the freeway,\" she says. \"That's when I thought, people used to be afraid of wolves, but now they stuff them.\" Burgi K\u00fchnemann's voice is hoarse and a subdued, but she enjoys talking. She introduces me to her next version of the Little Red Riding Hood: \"I'm giving it a political dimension. For example the Nazi era provides a lot of material. Adolf Hitler liked being called 'Uncle Wolf' by little girls.\" So the blonde and na\u00efve Little Red Riding Hood is only one of many red-hooded girls. It's the German version for young children. Once again, I walk by the display cases and think, Little Red Riding Hood was clearly schizophrenic.",

"story": "My Europe: Stop glorifying fascists! Europe needs a common culture of remembrance that rejects the fascist crimes of the past. That means Croatian, Hungarian and Latvian Nazi collaborators should not be glorified, says journalist Krsto Lazarevic. Last Saturday, some 10,000 people gathered in the Austrian town of Bleiburg to commemorate the deaths of 45,000 Ustasha soldiers. The Croatian fascist organization collaborated with Nazi Germany during World War II. In May 1945, Ustasha fighters fled from Yugoslavia into British-occupied territory. They were handed over to Josep Broz Tito's partisans and killed. At the recent gathering to mourn their deaths, Hitler salutes, Swastika tattoos and fascist Ustasha symbols were ubiquitous. As were attendees proclaiming \"Za dom Spremni\" (\"Ready for the homeland\") \u2014 Croatia's equivalent to Nazi Germany's \"Sieg Heil.\" Attendees claimed this was merely a \"commemorative event\" but critics have called its \"Europe's largest Nazi get-together.\" The gathering was organized by the Croatian Bishops' Conference, and tolerated by Austria's Roman Catholic Diocese of Gurk. High-ranking Croatian politicians came to the event, which was officially declared a religious gathering. Asked about the event, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz tried circumnavigating the issue or resorting to vague answers \u2014 as is his custom when asked about his conservative party's coalition partner, the far-right Freedom Party of Austria (FP\u00d6). His government's bigotry is plain to see. It took a tough stance on political gatherings of Turkish nationalists and far-right extremists in Austria, but then claimed its hands were tied when 10,000 Croatian Catholics got together for a huge neo-Nazi extravaganza. Council of Europe is alarmed The Council of Europe has expressed concern that the Ustasha gathering shows that fascim is becoming normal again in Croatia. A report by the Council's European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) says the Ustasha regime is increasingly being \"glorified,\" which feeds into this creeping normalization of neo-fascism. The report calls on Croatia's government to fight hate speech and protect minorities from xenophobic attacks. Read more: Neo-fascism on the rise in Croatia, Council of Europe finds But it's doubtful Croatia's ruling party, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), will listen. That's because in the past, it has railed against minorities, and stirred up anti-Serbian and anti-Roma sentiments in particular. It has incited hatred of the exact same ethnic groups that were once persecuted in the Independent State of Croatia, a World War II puppet state created by Hitler. Croatia's Jewish community has for years boycotted the national commemorative event to mark the liberation of Jasenovac death camp because they reject honoring the deceased alongside politicians who think favorably of the Ustasha regime, which persecuted Jews. Could you imagine German Chancellor Angela Merkel traveling to Argentina and speaking before the small German minority there, telling them it was a good thing Germans fled there after World War II? And that she welcomes mass murderers like Adolf Eichmann and Josef Mengele having fled there? But Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic did just that. On her visit to Argentina, she applauded compatriots who had managed to flee Tito's partisans and come to the Latin American country. But she failed to mention that said compatriots were concentration camp commanders, mass murderers and Nazi collaborators. Croatia isn't an isolated case Novelist Danilo Kis wrote that nationalism is a form of \"paranoia\" that goes hand in hand with losing one's sense of individuality and reality. This paranoia is based on the idea that one's own nation is something pure and innocent, and that anyone criticizing the nation must be a despicable enemy. Which is why right-wing Croatians glorify the Ustasha regime. Because to publicly accept that it killed hundreds of thousands of civilians would tarnish their national pride. It also helps explain why attendees at the Austrian commemorative event perceived themselves as victims, when in fact they were glorying a fascist regime. This is a worrying trend that also becoming apparent in other Eastern European countries. Many nations are highlighting what they endured under Soviet occupation and during communist times, casting themselves as victims. At the same time, many are down playing, denying or even celebrating compatriots who collaborated with Nazi Germany. Read more: Viktor Orban: Era of 'liberal democracy' is over Every year on March 16, thousands of people gather in Riga for the \"Latvian Legion Day\" to honor Latvians who served in the Waffen-SS. Last year, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban praised Nazi collaborator Miklos Horthy as an \"exceptional statesman,\" despite Horthy being partly responsible for the deportation of 600,000 Jews to German death camps. And in Serbia, there are moves to exonerate Milan Nedic, who also collaborated with Nazi Germany. If Europe is to become more integrated, this will necessitate not only a stronger European public sphere but also a common culture of remembrance, which must be decidedly anti-fascist. Europe will fail if not everyone agrees that the Nazis were despicable murderers, and if some European state leaders and governments choose to glorify Nazi collaborators. Krsto Lazarevic was born in Bosnia-Herzegovina and fled to Germany with his family as a child. Today he lives in Berlin, where he works as a journalist and commentator, writing for various German-language media outlets.",

"story": "Building collapses in India, killing several people and trapping others At least 14 workers have been killed after a building on a construction site in southern India collapsed. Dozens are feared trapped under the rubble, authorities say. A five-story building in the southern Indian state of Goa collapsed on Saturday, leaving at least 14 construction workers dead. Many more are believed to be trapped under the rubble, the local IANS news agency reported. Ten people are reported to have been pulled from the building alive overnight. Police Superintendent Shekhar Prabhudessai said it was not known how many people were working on the construction site in Canacona, a city about 70 kilometers (44 miles) south of the state capital Panaji, when it collapsed. Witnesses reported seeing about 40 workers at the site before the building collapsed. \"It was like an earthquake when the building fell,\" witness Ramesh Naik told the Associated Press news agency. \"You could not see what exactly had happened because of the dust.\" Bodies were pulled from the rubble by police and local residents, while fire-fighters and rescue personnel sifted through the debris searching for survivors. Around 20 construction workers were rescued, local police officer Abhay Naik told DPA. At least three of those were transferred by ambulance to a nearby hospital for treatment. \"The rescue operation will go on through the night. Cranes and bull-dozers [will be used] to remove the debris to rescue those trapped,\" Naik said. The cause of the building collapse had not been determined, Superintendant Prabhudessai said. Building collapses are comparatively common in India as a huge demand for housing and second-rate building regulations often encourages builders to use inappropriate materials or add additional floors.

"story": "Second Chord Sounds in 639-Year Long Concert A new chord sounded Thursday in the world's slowest and longest lasting concert of a piece of music that is taking a total 639 years to perform in its entirety. The abandoned Buchardi church in Halberstadt, eastern Germany, is the venue for a mind-boggling 639-year long performance of a piece of music by US experimental composer John Cage (1912-1992). Entitled \"organ2/ASLSP\" (or \"As SLow aS Possible\"), the performance began on September 5, 2001 and is scheduled to last until 2639. The first year and half of the performance was total silence, with the first chord -- G-sharp, B and G-sharp -- not sounding until February 2, 2003. Then in July 2004, two additional Es, an octave apart, were sounded and are scheduled to be released later this year on May 5. New chord will be held down by weights for years But on Thursday, the first chord progressed to a second -- comprising A, C and F-sharp -- and is to be held down over the next few years by weights on an organ being built especially for the project. Cage originally conceived \"ASLSP\" in 1985 as a 20-minute work for piano, subsequently transcribing it for organ in 1987. But organizers of the John Cage Organ Project decided to take the composer at his word and stretch out the performance for 639 years, using Cage's transcription for organ. The enormous running time was chosen to commemorate the creation of Halberstadt's historic Blockwerk organ in 1361 -- 639 years before the current project started. That original organ, built by Nikolaus Faber for Halberstadt's cathedral, was the first organ ever to be used for liturgical purposes, ringing in a new era in which the organ has played a central role in church music ever since. New pipes added in time for new notes As part of Halberstadt's John Cage Organ Project, a brand-new organ is being built specially, with new pipes added in time for when new notes are scheduled to sound. Cage was a pupil of one of the 20th century's most influential composers, Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg (1874-1951). Cage's avant-garde oeuvre includes works such as the notorious \"4'33\", a piece for orchestra comprising four minutes and 33 seconds of total silence, all meticulously notated. The organizers of the John Cage Organ Project say the record-breaking performance in Halberstadt also has a philosophical background -- to \"rediscover calm and slowness in today's fast-changing world.\"",

"story": "Germany, France at Helm of EU Constitution Makeover Sold to the public as an \"EU constitution\" the first time around, the document meant to structure and streamline the bloc failed to fly. Now, France and Germany are hoping a repackaged treaty might prove more marketable. The EU Constitution is being dusted off and given a whole new image in an attempt to make it more palatable to a skeptical public. Overseeing the makeover are German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Jacques Chirac. Critics claimed that the idea of a constitution was too formal and threatening to many voters, especially those in France and the Netherlands, whose populations rejected the draft document when it was put to a referendum last year. The aim now is to give the document a name that more accurately reflects its purpose. According to the Financial Times, one alternative being floated is \"institutional treaty.\" While that may not be a particularly sexy label, it does describe one of the main reasons why the text was conceived -- to streamline and reform the bloc's institutions so that it is better able to cope with enlargement. With Paris and Berlin overseeing the document's future, though, conflict is bound to occur. Berlin has said it prefers to revive the text more or less in its entirety but tinker with the passages that caused concern to make them more acceptable. Paris has indicated that it is reluctant to put the charter to voters a second time, preferring to adopt single elements instead. Reports of a rapprochement between the two positions started to surface earlier this month, however. The German newsweekly Der Spiegel said that, according to plans, the charter would be reduced to its first two parts which set out the EU's competences and the fundamental rights of the union. The third and largest part of the treaty, which focuses on condensing and re-ordering existing EU treaties, would be handled separately. The operation to revive the charter is expected to begin in earnest under the German EU presidency in the first half of 2007.",

"story": "Public sector workers in Spain strike against austerity measures In a test of the Spanish government's resolve to push forward with tough austerity measures that include cuts to civil servant pay, about three-quarters of Spain's public sector workers have gone on strike. Civil servants in Spain began a one-day strike Tuesday to protest the government's plans to reduce the country's massive budget deficit by cutting their salaries. Strikers included workers in cleaning, postal and health services, educators, firefighters, doctors and transportation workers. Union sources put participation at around 75 percent of the country's approximately 2.3 million public employees, and said Spain's most recent austerity package, totaling 15 billion euros ($18 billion) would give civil servants a 5-percent wage cut in 2010 and a wage freeze in 2011, the first public wage reduction in 30 years. The government's aim is to reduce Spain's public deficit from 11.2 percent in 2009 to 6 percent in 2011. It hopes to reach the eurozone's 3-percent limit by 2013. Ignacio Fernandez Toxo, leader of the CCOO trade union, said Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero's government has \"uncritically\" accepted European Union recommendations, acting \"without any other horizon than cutting costs.\" Unions are typically close to Zapatero's Socialist Party, which has been losing popularity amid gloomy economic forecasts and 20 percent unemployment, the eurozone's highest. Labor market reform Tuesday's strike is a potential preview of a full-fledged general strike that unions are threatening if government plans to enact labor market reform curtail workers' rights. Unions, employers and government officials have been negotiating what the reform might entail for months. UGT union confederation leader Candido Mendez has called the discussions \"difficult.\" The government says it will enact the reforms by decree if it cannot reach an agreement through negotiations. The reform would loosen restrictions on severance pay for permanent workers, who have become prohibitively expensive to lay off. These conditions have created a two-tier labor market where about a quarter of workers are left with temporary contracts that provide few rights. Most economists agree that reforming the labor market - together with restructuring banks and reducing the deficit - is necessary to remedy Spain's chronic economic problems.

"story": "Hamas and Israel cling to their war aims The war in Gaza has reached a deadlock. Israel wants to keep fighting until Hamas stops firing rockets. Hamas wants to keep fighting until its goals are reached - aims that are wholly inacceptable to Israel. International diplomats, foreign ministers and UN representatives are frantically trying to achieve a ceasefire in the Gaza war. US Secretary of State John Kerry and UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon traveled to Cairo to look for ways to end what has turned into two weeks of bloodshed. A ceasefire still seems like a distant prospect. Despite the deaths of around 600 Palestinians and 30 Israelis, the attacks continue on both sides. Hamas and the Israeli government in Jerusalem want to keep fighting until they have reached their respective goals. Giving in to a ceasefire would be tantamount to defeat for them. Jordanian political scientist Hasan al-Momani says that Hamas and Israel have allowed the situation to escalate to the point that they are at a dead end - with no way out unless they achieve some of their goals. Israel says it will keep fighting until Hamas' launch pads and tunnels out of the Gaza Strip are destroyed. The Palestinian organization uses tunnels between Gaza and Egypt to restock supplies, including weapons. Al-Momani says Hamas is allowing an escalation to occur to generate enough international pressure for the sake of achieving its goals. Above all, those aims involve ending Israel's blockade of the narrow Gaza Strip. Further demands include the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons and a stop to Israel's Gaza offensive. \"I think, for Hamas, the crisis provides an opportunity to end its political isolation,\" al-Momani says. A weakened negotiating position An initial attempt at a ceasefire with Egypt's meditation failed last week. Hamas' military wing, the Qassam Brigades, is maintaining its rocket attacks against Israeli cities. In response, Israel's air force struck targets in Gaza. Shlomo Brom of the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv argues that Egypt no longer has the trust of Hamas. Egypt, Brom says, was once able to mediate, but the new government in Cairo takes a critical stance toward Hamas. \"Hamas prefers as mediators other states that are closer to it - and that is Qatar and Turkey,\" Brom adds, noting that Israel, on the other hand, distrusts these two as possible mediators. Brom, who is Israeli, says Hamas is too weak to be able to stop its attacks at the moment. \"That may seem like a paradox, but it's not. Because when a group of people are in a very difficult situation - when they feel that they are cornered - then the feeling is that they cannot give up. If they would give up, it would be a slippery slope that would lead to their end,\" he explains. The INSS expert says he believes Hamas is suffering from a lack of supporters after many turned away, leaving Qatar as the sole source of financing. But money from the wealthy Gulf state can't simply be wired over. Brom says smuggling suitcases of money through the tunnels has become more difficult, and the destruction of the tunnels means Hamas also has diminished tax revenue on smuggled goods - leaving them bankrupt, according to the Israeli analyst. Ten Hamas demands As a condition for a lasting ceasefire, Hamas has set out 10 demands, including a withdrawal of Israeli troops and the opening of border crossings to Gaza. Furthermore, Hamas wants to have a port and airport under UN supervision. Palestinians are also calling for the air space over Gaza to be closed to Israeli aircraft and for the permission to travel to Jerusalem. Brom says some of these points are unrealistic, such as an end to Israeli control of Gaza's air space. \"There's no chance that Israel will agree to stop this activity as long as Hamas is arming itself and depicting itself as the enemy of Israel,\" he says, adding that Israel needs to maintain its cover in Gaza to block attacks from the region. Brom says that he thinks the reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah could help stabilize the entire situation, however. \"It can be used for a gradual return of the Palestinian Authority to the Gaza Strip. That was what actually was agreed between Hamas and Fatah,\" he says. Hamas has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, which is when Fatah officials were driven out. It wasn't until two months ago that the two sides agreed to form a unity government. But it was Israel, which works together in some ways with the Fatah-led government in the West Bank, that torpedoed this reconciliation. Brom says that was a mistake. Jordanian political analyst al-Momani also says Israel's opposition to the deal helps explain the current escalation in violence. One of Hamas' 10 demands ties in to that situation - Israel, it says, must promise not to interfere with Palestinian affairs. But, it's unlikely Israel would agree to such a demand as long as groups such as Hamas declare themselves enemies of the country.",

"story": "US government sanctions Venezuelan vice president for drug trafficking The Trump administration has slapped sanctions on Venezuela's new vice president, placing him on its narcotics \"kingpin\" list. Tareck El Aissami is the most senior Venezuelan official to be targeted by the US. In a move likely to further strain ties between the two nations, on Monday the United States accused hard-line Venezuelan Vice President Tareck El Aissami of playing a \"significant role\" in international drug trafficking. El Aissami was designated for sanctions under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, the US Treasury Department announced on its website. The Treasury Department accused El Aissami of facilitating and overseeing large shipments of drugs from Venezuela to Mexico and the United States while serving as the country's interior minister. El Aissami, who became the vice president on January 4, was allegedly paid by Venezuela's largest convicted drug trafficker, Walid Makled, to protect shipments. He also allegedly coordinated those shipments with Mexico's violent Los Zetas cartel, the Treasury Department said in a statement. The US government also issued sanctions against Samark Lopez, a Venezuelan businessman who is believed to be El Aissami's front man. As a result of the actions, 13 companies owned or controlled by Lopez will be blocked and both men's US-held assets will be frozen Monday's sanctions freeze the assets of 13 companies owned or controlled by Lopez. They also ban US citizens from doing business with either men or the listed companies. Additionally, Lopez and El Aissami are barred from entering the United States. Sanctions 'overdue' El Aissami had long been targeted by US law enforcement officials for his alleged ties to Walid Makled as well as to a Middle Eastern militant group. During his tenure as interior minister, dozens of fraudulent Venezuelan passports were uncovered in the Middle East, including some held by alleged Hezbollah members. The sanctions were the result of a multiyear investigation to target drug traffickers in Venezuela, John Smith, the acting director of the US's Office of Foreign Assets Control, said in a statement. A former Obama administration official told the Associated Press that the move to levy sanctions against El Aissami was held up last year at the request of the State Department. At the time, they feared that the decision would interfere with Vatican-backed talks between the government and the opposition. \"This was an overdue step to ratchet up pressure on the Venezuelan regime and signal that top officials will suffer consequences if they continue to engage in massive corruption, abuse human rights and dismantle democracy,\" said Mark Feierstein, who was Obama's top national security adviser on Latin America. Last Wednesday, 34 Republican and Democratic members of Congress sent a letter to US President Donald Trump asking his administration to sanction Venezuelan officials, including El Aissami. Senior US officials took care to emphasize that the sanctions were related to a criminal investigation and not political, diplomatic or economic. Nevertheless, the sanctions are bound to increase tensions between the United States and its harshest critic in Latin America.

"story": "Top Teams Let Nerves Get to Them Bundesliga Champions Bayern Munich entertained their fans with an easy 6-3 win over Nuremberg. With the exception of Bremen, the remaining top teams showed a large case of nerves. Bayern Munich staged a grand finale to their 33-year run at the Olympic Stadium on Saturday with their win over Nuremberg -- their last match at one of the world's most famous sports venues. Captain and goalkeeper Oliver Kahn was presented with the Bundesliga championship on the pitch after the game. Bayern clinched their 19th German league title two weeks ago, and so had truly had just one thing to play for on Saturday, namely setting up their top striker Roy Makaay (19 goals) as much as possible in his chase for the goalscoring crown. The man ahead of him, Marek Mintal (23 goals) and his Nuremberg squad traveled to Munich and were given a 6-3 pasting at the hands of the Bundesliga champions. Makaay struck twice in the first half, and just as importantly, Mintal was held goalless in the last match that Bayern will play at Olympic stadium. After the game, the players received their medals from the league. Their last goal is to help Makaay score at least two more goals next week against Stuttgart. Entering the second-to-last match day, second place Schalke had the chance to wrap up a spot in the Champions League next season -- and that against archrivals Dortmund to whom Schalke had not lost in 12 games. Instead, they lost shockingly, 2-1, at home. All the goals came in the first half. Dortmund scored on their first real chance only to see Schalke get the equalizer two minutes later. Just before the end of the first half, Dortmund's homegrown Lars Ricken scored what would be the gamewinning goal. Dortmund keeper Roman Weidenfeller was the hero of the match as he stopped numerous top-notch Schalke chances. Rivals also stumble Stuttgart could have been the beneficiaries of Schalke's misfortune but they too dropped their match, losing to relegated side Bochum, 2-0. They remain two points behind Schalke but have the daunting task of facing their old coach Felix Magath and Bayern Munich. Hot on Stuttgart's tails were Hertha Berlin (57 points). They could have leapfrogged over the Swabians but instead played to a disappointing 0-0 draw against lowly M\u00f6nchengladbach. The one point for Gladbach means they will stay in the top division next season. Last year's champions Werder Bremen turned a 1-0 halftime deficit against last place Freiburg into an easy 4-1 victory at Weser Stadium. On 56 points, coach Thomas Schaaf's side could still squeeze into the Champions League qualifications, but are almost assured of a spot in the Uefa Cup. For Leverkusen, the quest for an Uefa Cup spot is becoming more and more uncertain. A late second-half goal by Daniel Bierofka gave them a draw against Wolfsburg. For the Wolves, another disappointment as they surrendered a 2-0 halftime lead at home. New boys win derby One of the league's most interesting stories this season was Mainz. In their first-ever season in the Bundesliga, they beat top-notch squads (Schalke, Bremen, Leverkusen) and easily secured a spot for the top division next year. They won the Rhineland-Palatinate derby on Saturday against nearby rivals, Kaiserslautern, 3-2, adding another feather to the cap of coach J\u00fcrgen Klopp. Rostock were playing for pride at home in the first division for at least one year. That incentive wasn't sufficient enough for them to get beyond a 1-1 draw with Bielefeld. Finally, Hamburg's 2-1 loss to Hanover means they can write off their hopes of playing in European club competition next season.",

"story": "Push to develop open source software On December 11, Linux 3.7 was released, bringing with it additional advantages. The explosion of web platforms and business is in part due to Linux and the push to develop open source software. On December 11, Linux 3.7 was released. It is supposed to make it easer to get Linux-based OSs running on tablet PCs and smartphones. Around two percent of smartphones use GNU/Linux (a combination of Linux and the GNU OS), a figure that is comparable to 2.6 percent for Windows, according to figures from market research firm International Data Corporation (IDC). And Samsung accounts for 80 percent of all GNU/Linux-powered smartphones, using Bada. Several companies and devices today owe their developments to GNU/Linux, a free software platform. And that includes the likes of Google, Facebook, Amazon and Wikipedia, as well as Apple's MacOS which long used parts of GNU. Android contains Linux but not GNU. In Germany, many regional government departments use GNU/Linux as an alternative to other more mainstream operation systems \u2013 Microsoft\u2019s Windows and Apple\u2019s OS. This year, the city of Munich announced a 10 million euro ($12.9 million) saving since changing over from Microsoft Windows based software in 2006. \"It comes down to not having to pay licensing costs,\" Peter Hoffman, project director of Munich's LiMux Project tells DW in an interview. Its premise is to encourage software development which is to be shared amongst users. Best of all, it's free. Giving back to users Licensing costs are big money. The beauty of GNU/Linux, says Jan Richling, a post doctorate fellow at the Technical University in Berlin, is its flexibility that really gives it an edge. \"More important is the total cost of ownership. You need people who will make an adaption of Linux to your needs,\" he says. Given the notion users with computer coding skills essentially create their own software, which they then give back, for free, to other users to use, or develop further is appealing he adds. Ease of use Software companies like Apple and Microsoft have created closed systems for their products and software. And while this gives users the advantage of synchronizing many of their devices to the same operating system, consumers are left at their mercy, Jon \"Maddog\" Hall, Linux International's executive director, said at a recent TedX Conference in Berlin. \"With free software, you can make the decision about whether you're going to stay with the code you have running. It's not the decision of some far off company that's trying to satisfy the needs of a commodity marketplace,\" he added. But despite the advantages that open source platforms, they require the expertise of programmers, who understand the coding and remain up to date with the latest changes in the software. And despite the fact that they would be expected to do well in poor countries, they have so far proved to be unpopular. This is because the software requires a large bandwidth to be downloaded, and in most places people have access to pirated software \u2013 more than 90 percent of Windows software being using in poor countries is a pirate version.",

"story": "Israeli-Palestinian conflict rears its ugly head Israeli troops have fired upon the Gaza Strip for the first time since November in retaliation for an attack from the Palestinian territories. It appears that Hamas is struggling to control splinter groups. The heavily guarded border between Israel and the Gaza Strip had been largely calm for four months - until Tuesday night. For the first time since a ceasefire was brokered in November 2012, the Israeli Air Force targeted areas in the Gaza Strip. Rockets fired from the Palestinian territories preceded the Israeli strikes. On Wednesday, rockets were fired from Palestinian coastal regions into Israel. The exchange of fire has triggered concerns of a repeat of the eight-day war between Hamas and Israel last November. Six Israelis and 169 Palestinians died during that conflict. \"We will not allow shooting of any sort (even sporadic) towards our citizens and our forces,\" said Israel's new Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon. \"Israel has no intention of ignoring fire from Syria toward Israeli territory, incidental or not, and will respond with a firm hand,\" Yaalon added. A Palestinian Salafist group claimed responsibility for the initial rocket attack, although this could not be confirmed. The Israeli army routinely blames any attacks on Hamas, which, it believes, should be enforcing the territorial ceasefire. When US President Barack Obama visited Israel last month, a group of alleged Salafists violated the ceasefire by launching rockets on the Israeli city of Sderot. Hamas reportedly apprehended the attackers at that time. Hamas likely not involved Palestinian journalist Anis Muhsin of the Institute for Palestine Studies in Beirut ruled out a Hamas connection in the most recent attack. \"It's not in their interests. They're governing the Gaza Strip, and want the situation there to stay very quiet,\" Muhsin told DW. Hamas only recently established its new leadership and was thus seeking stability, Muhsin added. More likely, he said, the attackers were small factions with connections to other countries or to al Qaeda, and were seeking to shatter whatever fragile peace exists in the region. In effect, this was a blow to Hamas and its goals of controlling the area and preventing further attacks. Muhsin believes the most recent escalation could be linked to the death of a Palestinian prisoner in Israel. The Salafist group that claimed responsibility for the recent shelling allegedly sought to avenge the prisoner's death. Palestinian agencies had accused Israeli authorities of denying necessary treatment to the prisoner, Maysara Abu Hamdiyeh, who died of cancer aged 64 this past Tuesday. \"That made the Palestinian population and the political class angry,\" Muhsin said. Although Israeli prison authorities denied the accusations, around 5,000 Palestinian prisoners declared a hunger strike in solidarity with Hamdiyeh. Struggling to control radicals Israeli political scientist Yithak Reiter agrees that more radical Palestinian groups than Hamas have an interest in firing rockets at Israel in light of developments over the past months. After the ceasefire was declared in November, Israel and Hamas opened talks. The Islamist Palestinian organization was supposed to have stuck to its promise of preventing attacks from the coastal strip, while Israel's part of the deal was to ease its clampdown on the region. Reiter said delegations from both sides were currently meeting in Cairo in an effort to expedite that process - a move that militant groups could torpedo through violence. Whether the bloody cycle of violence and revenge will restart is not clear. Reiter said diplomacy still stood a chance, reflected by US Secretary of State John Kerry's Middle East tour and his attempts to mediate between Israel and Palestine. \"Only if these attempts result in a dead end, will we see more frustration and violence,\" Reiter concluded.",

"story": "Rule of law under threat: Poland in the EU pillory The EU Commission has activated the next stage in its constitutional proceedings against Poland. Warsaw is outraged. What next in the battle over the constitutional court? Bernd Riegert reports. What we are now seeing is political foreplay, in an attempt to avoid more heavy-handed intervention by the EU Commission. By launching proceedings against Poland for violating the rule of law, the EU Commission is entering uncharted waters. For the first time ever, the Juncker-led Commission is making use of an instrument that it only acquired in March 2014, when it was supported by the European Parliament; the Council of Ministers, or representatives of the national governments, had reservations. The so-called rule of law mechanism is essentially just a formal, structured dialogue between the Commission and the \"offender.\" The mechanism was introduced as a precursor to the actual sanctions procedure according to Article 7 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty. This \"political atomic bomb,\" as it was described by the former EU Commissioner for Justice, Viviane Reding, can ultimately lead to the revocation of voting rights for the accused country. The EU has never yet applied Article 7. It didn't dare do so in 2010 when the EU Commission demanded a revision of changes to the Hungarian constitution. What accusations has the EU Commission made against Poland? The vice-president of the Commission, Frans Timmermans, and his lawyers accuse the Polish government of \"systematically endangering\" the rule of law in Poland. They say that changes in the composition of Poland's constitutional court and the circumvention of its modus operandi restrict the independence of the judiciary in a manner that contravenes European principles of the rule of law. These basic principles are laid down in the Lisbon Treaty, to which of course Poland, as a member state, is of course also a signatory. The situation has been aggravated by the government's refusal to publish and recognize the court's judgments. How has the Polish government reacted? Poland's national-conservative prime minister Beata Szydlo has adopted a strident tone. She sees the EU Commission's actions as an attack on Polish sovereignty. She insists that, following a landslide victory last year, her party has the right to shape the Polish judiciary, media and politics in the manner that, in her opinion, is what the voters want. Timmermans' negotiations in person in Warsaw failed to bring about a rapprochement. Szydlo ranted in parliament that the EU Commission wanted to destroy the EU. \"It's not Poland that has a problem with the Commission - the Commission has a problem with itself,\" she said. Is there an umpire? In principle, the Council of Europe's so-called Venice Commission in Strasbourg is a recognized referee on tricky constitutional questions. The Polish government expressly requested an opinion from this board of European and American constitutional law experts. In March, however, the decision of the Venice Commission went against Poland. Suddenly the government in Warsaw no longer felt bound to its commitment to recognize the judgment. The Council of Europe is an association of European states that primarily supervises the preservation of human rights. It is not a European Union institution. What's the procedure? After dialog was opened in January, the Polish government had four months in which to explain its actions. As the EU Commission has not so far detected any response to its concerns, it is now implementing the second stage of the mechanism by publishing a formal warning to Poland to return to constitutional principles. The Warsaw government now has just two weeks in which to respond to the warning. If it does not do so before the deadline, the EU Commission will submit a concrete recommendation as to the legal and political steps Poland must take in order to safeguard the rule of law, in particular the independence of the constitutional court and the freedom of the press. If Poland rejects these recommendations, there is the option of dropping the \"atom bomb\" and initiating proceedings according to Article 7 of the Lisbon Treaty. Can the EU really punish Poland? The EU Commission has no way of imposing penalties on a member state. Only the EU Council can do that - the committee made up of representatives of the governments of all 28 member states. According to Article 7 of the EU Treaty, the Council can decide with a four-fifths majority that \"the clear danger of a grave infringement\" of common values exists in Poland. Poland would receive recommendations on how to remedy these deficiencies. If that doesn't work, the Council can establish that a \"grave infringement\" of common values has occurred. This must be decided unanimously; Poland would not be entitled to vote. However, it is highly unlikely that all of the remaining 27 member states - including Britain - really would show the Polish government up in this way. The Hungarian premier, Viktor Orban, has already declared his solidarity with Poland. As a final step, the Council can then impose penalties on Poland: it can either revoke its voting rights or cut financial resources. After all, Poland is the biggest beneficiary of the EU funding. Will it come to this? At the moment, it is very hard to imagine this scenario. Rather, the focus of the EU Commission in Brussels is to avoid sparking even more crises within the EU. On the other hand, the Commission must ensure that it retains its credibility as \"custodian of the EU treaties.\" It's clear that the rule of law mechanism and the proceedings according to Article 7 will go on for many more months, if not years. Besides, the Polish government may look at the possibility of taking action of its own over individual steps and taking these to the European Court. So far the EU has always managed to avoid formal penalties in disputes like these. Orban, Hungary's nationalist premier, did at least partially relent after a noisy argument with the EU Commission in 2012. The ostracism of Austria in 2000, when the right-wing populist FP\u00d6 joined the government, came to nothing. No sanctions were imposed on the neo-fascists in Italy's government under Silvio Berlusconi. The threshold for penalties is relatively high. \"It was only when Viktor Orban started going on about reintroducing the death penalty that the red line came into view,\" says one EU diplomat. Had Orban succeeded in doing this, criminal proceedings according to Article 7 would have had to have been initiated.",

"story": "More Money than the Nobel Prize Germany is well-known for its many past scientific achievements, but today it struggles to keep up with international research. But two new science awards are leading researchers back to German labs. Ten years ago German immunologist Joachim Schultze started working at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Like many top German scientists, he had been lured to the United States because of the good conditions for research including excellent funding. And Schultze likely would have stayed at Harvard if he hadn\u2019t been awarded one of 43 research stipends worth a total of around \u20ac36 million ($39 million). Now he\u2019s back in Germany carrying on with his cancer research at the University of Cologne. Schultze and others have profited from two new German research prizes: the Wolfgang Paul award for scientists from abroad and the Sofja Kovalevskaja award for young scientists. Both were awarded for the first and only time in the autumn of 2001. The money for the awards came from the sale of German third-generation moblie phone licenses in 2000, which added \u20ac50.5 billion to the government's coffers. The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research awarded the stipends, which were meant to finance years of scientific research in Germany. Individual prize-winners received up to \u20ac2.3 million, twice the amount that Nobel prize-winners take home. Aims met Expectations were particularly high for the prize-winners, said Humboldt Foundation spokesman Florian Krebs. He said the first year and a half had been very successful. Russian physicist and Wolfgang Paul award laureate Alexei Khokhlov has also pleased with the results. The award has fulfilled its aim of introducing new prospects for research at German universities, he told DW-WORLD. With his prize-money Khokhlov has been able to establish a project dealing with research into polymer physics -- which deals with materials made up of large molecules -- at the University of Ulm. Khokhlov says one of Germany\u2019s weaknesses in science is that universities can\u2019t pick and choose their students. Instead institutions of higher learning, the vast majority of which are public, are obliged to accept any applicant with a German high school diploma. Undeserved reputation Germany doesn\u2019t deserve its reputation as a bad place for science, said immunologist Schultze. But changes are necessary. For one, universities need not all have the same capacities, he says. He recommends the development of \"centers of excellence\" like in the United States with world-class universities like Harvard, Stanford and Yale. And Schultze points out that German scientists still have to learn a lesson their American colleagues figured out long ago: it pays to advertise. He said scientists should start using public relations to draw attention to their own high level research. Though Germany may never be able to compete with the United States for research funding, the new awards may just convince a few more scientists like Schultze to leave Boston for the likes of Cologne.",

"story": "Ban Ki-moon urges calm amid violence between Israel and Palestinians During a surprise visit to Jerusalem, United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has cautioned against an escalation of violence. His message to the local populace was marred by more deaths in the West Bank. Speaking during a meeting with Israeli President Reuven Rivlin on Tuesday, Ban called for an end to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. The UN secretary-general said that a lack of \"political horizon\" was to blame for the recent wave of violent attacks on Palestinian and Israeli territory. \"Violence only undermines the legitimate Palestinian aspiration for statehood,\" Ban said. \"If we do not act fast, the dynamics on the ground will only get worse,\" he warned, adding that it was not yet too late to \"avoid a broader crisis.\" German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier shared a similar message on Tuesday, during a visit to his Jordanian counterpart in Ammam. Steinmeier urged Israelis and Palestinians to avoid action that could \"further inflame\" the unrest, wanring of \"incalculable consequences.\" Death toll rises Ban's visit to Jerusalem on Tuesday was overshadowed by yet more deaths in the West Bank. Israeli police said earlier in the day that a Palestinian had been fatally shot after he drove his car into a group of Israelis near Jerusalem. An Israeli man also died in a separate incident, when he was run over by a truck during a clash with Palestinians. According to a Palestinian security official, the driver turned himself in to police, saying he hit the man by accident. Over the past month, 10 Israelis have been killed in Palestinian attacks, most of which were stabbings. In that time, 43 Palestinians were also killed by Israeli fire, including 20 attackers. An Eritrean migrant also died at the weekend, after being shot and beaten by a mob that mistakenly believed he was a Palestinian assailant. Ban is to meet with Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas on Wednesday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in Berlin for talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. ksb/msh (AFP, AP, dpa)",

"story": "UN-endorsed report finds internal displacement growing in Syria, Africa The world is experiencing a record number of people displaced within their own countries by armed conflict. In Syria alone, one family is displaced every 60 minutes, according to a UN report. A report released Wednesday at the United Nations in Geneva has found that 33.3 million people were displaced within their own countries at the end of 2013 - 4.5 million more than in 2012. The report was compiled by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), a part of the Norwegian Refugee Council. \"This record number of people forced to flee inside their own countries confirms a disturbing upward trend of internal displacement since IDMC first began monitoring and analyzing displacement back in the late 1990s,\" said Jan Egeland, the secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council. \"The dramatic increase in forced displacement in 2013 and the fact that the average amount of time people worldwide are living in displacement is now a staggering 17 years, all suggest that something is going terribly wrong in how we are responding and dealing with this issue,\" he added. In cooperation with the UNHCR refugee agency, the IDMC also reported Wednesday that 8.2 million people had fled their homes in 2013, including about 3.5 million in Syria alone, to bring the total of internally displaced people there to 6.5 million. The other two-thirds of the cumulative 33.3 million displaced by war worldwide had fled in previous years and have not yet been able to return to their homes. The figures show that 63 percent of those internally displaced worldwide find themselves torn from their homes in just five countries: Syria, Colombia, Nigeria, Congo and Sudan. Displacement in the Central African Republic is also on the rise. mkg/ (kna, dpa, AP)",

"story": "Ukraine activist Bulatov reveals details of alleged kidnapping Ukraine activist Dmytro Bulatov has shed light on his alleged kidnapping, and has told reporters he had begged his captors to kill him. Bulatov said he was so desperate to end the ordeal he made false confessions. Bulatov fronted a press conference in Vilnius, Lithuania on Thursday to outline the details of his ordeal, which began with his abduction on January 22. He was discovered eight days later, bloodied and claiming he was tortured by his captors. Bulatov was one of the leaders of the group Automaidan, which uses vehicles to blockade streets in protection of protest groups. He had been active in the anti-government protests gripping Ukraine, with President Viktor Yanukovych under pressure after electing not to sign an association agreement with the European Union in November. False confession Bulatov is one of several prominent activists said to have been abducted, and said his captors repeatedly asked him who was funding the protests. He said he had falsely confessed to having received $50,000 (36,800 euros) from a United States ambassador in an attempt to stop the torture. \"They cut my ear, I couldn't feel how much they cut off my ear. They took the piece of my ear and touched my face with it,\" he told reporters. \"The only thing I wanted was for this to stop \u2026 I said whatever they wanted.\" \"On the last day they put me on my knees. They said, 'We are going to crucify you.' I was asking them to kill me because I was unable to stand this any more,\" he added \"Some time later they came and put a bag on my head and took me somewhere. I was hoping my suffering was finished.\" Bulatov flew to Lithuania for further medical treatment, and told news agency Reuters he would not return to Ukraine unless he received guarantees he would not be prosecuted. Constitutional change sought Ukraine's opposition parties are continuing their push to return the constitution to its 2004 form - a move that would shift several powers from the president to parliament. Yanukovych has rejected the proposal, but a spokesman from the president's Party of the Regions said leaders of all parliamentary groups are set to meet in the coming days to discuss a bill. \"Next week, we should take a decision - maybe on Tuesday, Wednesday - to consider this draft law,\" Party of the Regions' speaker Volodymyr Rybak told lawmakers. Speaking on Wednesday, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton called for political action to end the turmoil, saying a potential aid package from the US and EU would be more than simply monetary assistance. ph/dr (Reuters, dpa)",

"story": "Bundesliga: What to watch out for on the final day of the season All eyes will be on Hamburg as the battle to avoid the dreaded relegation play-off goes down to the wire. At the top, Dortmund and Hoffenheim fight for third, while Cologne could return to Europe after 25 years.  The relegation battle - Hamburg, Wolfsburg & Augsburg Hamburg are on the brink again. Despite an upturn in home form under Markus Gisdol, a recent run of five games without a win has once again left the Bundesliga dinosaur in serious trouble. Only a win against direct relegation rivals Wolfsburg will be enough to avoid a third play-off in four seasons. Hamburg will be without their relegation savior Pierre-Michel Lasogga, who has been ruled out with a hamstring injury. Lasogga scored the deciding goal against Greuther F\u00fcrth in the 2014 play-off and also scored a vital, last-gasp equalizer away at Schalke last week. Adding to Hamburg's worries, top scorer Nicolai M\u00fcller also limped out of training on Wednesday - although medical staff have confirmed that he has not further damaged a knee ligament which he tore only six weeks ago. Just as they did two weeks ago ahead of the 0-0 draw against Mainz, Hamburg have retreated to a secluded training camp in Lower Saxony for team-building. For opponents Wolfsburg, it's business as usual. \"The special thing about us is that we're not doing anything special,\" said sport director Olaf Rebbe. Two years since coming second in the Bundesliga and winning the German Cup, the Wolves need a point to guarantee survival. \"The pressure is on HSV,\" insists striker Mario Gomez, who has scored 10 of Wolfsburg's 13 goals since Dutch coach Andries Jonker took over, and who could play a decisive role on Saturday. Augsburg aren't safe yet either. Should they lose to Hoffenheim by a greater margin than Wolfsburg lose to HSV, it will be Manuel Baum's team who finish 16th. That all depends on Hoffenheim \u2026 The battle for third - Dortmund & Hoffenheim Both Borussia Dortmund and TSG 1899 Hoffenheim will play Champions League football next season - although one will have to negotiate a potentially tricky qualifying round first. After Dortmund's draw at Augsburg last week, the two sides are level on points, meaning it could come down to goal difference - a fact which annoyed Hoffenheim coach Julian Nagelsmann after his team only managed to beat Werder Bremen 5-3 last week having lead 5-0. \"We could have scored seven or eight,\" he said. \"That would have made our position much stronger.\" \"I must admit, I didn't realize that goal difference could come into play,\" admitted striker Andre Kramaric. \"We were too relaxed in the final 30 minutes. We could have got closer to Dortmund.\" The fact that Hoffenheim need to make up a four-goal deficit on Dortmund is not good news for opponents Ausgburg, for whom a heavy defeat combined with a Hamburg victory over Wolfsburg would see them drop into the play-off. Should Dortmund and Hoffenheim finish level on points and with an equal goal difference, Dortmund would finish third based on the two teams' head-to-head record. Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will be hoping to add to his 27 Bundesliga goals as the battle for the Bundesliga golden boot goes down to the final day. Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski (28 goals) will feel confident of finding the net against Freiburg. The battle for Europe - Berlin, Freiburg, Cologne & Bremen The Champions League places may have been decided but three teams are still battling to qualify for the Europa League. For Hertha Berlin, a point at home to Bayer Leverkusen would see them qualify automatically for a competition which they were knocked out of this season before it even began. For Freiburg, the Europa League would merely be an unexpected cherry on the icing of their Bundesliga cake. For all the talk of Red Bull-backed Leipzig and Dietmar Hopp's multi-million-euro investment in Hoffenheim, Christian Streich has produced a genuine fairytale in the Black Forest with the league's third-smallest budget. A point away at champions Bayern could be enough for Europe. However, doubts remain as to whether Freiburg could handle the added burden of European football with a small squad which is already set to be weakened by the departures of top scorer Vincenzo Grifo (to Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach) and perhaps also Maximillian Philipp (interest from RB Leipzig and Tottenham Hotspur). For Cologne, the 25-year wait for European competition could finally be at an end. \"One day it will happen!\" the fanatical fans have been singing all season, \"one day we'll go to Milan to see FC!\" The whole city is buzzing with excitement. \"It's the only topic in the dressing room,\" revealed coach Peter St\u00f6ger. \"It's a final for us and for all of Cologne.\" Cologne must beat Mainz and hope that either Hertha or Freiburg lose. Finally, Bremen fans would have laughed at the thought of Europe when they were 15th at Christmas. But an astonishing turnaround in the second half of the season has seen the Green & Whites rocket up the table and knock on the door of the Europa League. Werder have the simple task of winning away at Dortmund and hoping that Freiburg lose and Cologne don't win.

"story": "How survivors and victims' families cope after a mass murder Mass shootings and terror strikes leave a wake of death and destruction behind them. But in the aftermath, the people who suffer most and the longest are survivors and the victims' families. \"I switched on the TV on Friday evening after my dinner and saw pictures of the shooter targeting and killing people. I asked myself whether Tim K. had behaved in the same manner as the attacker in Munich,\" said Barbara Nalepa in an interview with Germany's public broadcaster ARD. Nalepa lost her daughter Nicole to a mass shooting seven years ago in Winnenden in southern Germany. At the time, 17-year-old Tim K. used guns found in his parents' home to kill 15 people before committing suicide. Nalepa said the old memories had come alive inside her again when she heard about the July 22 mass shooting at Munich's Olympia shopping mall. The 18-year-old, Ali David S., who was \"proud\" of sharing his birthday with Adolf Hitler, gunned down nine people. The immediate aftermath of a mass murder Immediately after the attack, \"the reaction is one of shock,\" says Petra Hohn of \"Verwaiste Eltern\" - literally, orphaned parents - which counsels mothers and fathers who have lost their children to a tragedy. \"Each person reacts differently. Some people cry and scream, some become quiet and stop speaking,\" Hohn adds. \"In the immediate aftermath of a terror attack - like the one in Paris - there is fear, people go numb, they have physical injuries, they cannot think straight and are hypersensitive to triggers,\" Levent Altan tells DW. Altan is the executive director of Brussels-based Victims Support Europe, an umbrella organization that works towards providing legal, emotional and psychological support to victims of any crime. Practical needs also take precedence right after a shooting or a similar event. What people need most is information. \"It can be extremely difficult to get information or find a loved one,\" Altan says, describing how a distressed father was looking for his daughter in Nice, where a man plowed a truck into Bastilles day celebrations, killing 84 people. Things like healthcare, insurance and compensation also need to be sorted out, especially if there are foreign victims. A feeling of solidarity The atmosphere during the immediate aftermath of an attack gives a feeling of solidarity with victims. The \"honeymoon period,\" according to Altan is when everyone is focused on the event and victims are grateful to have survived. \"There is a feeling of love from all over the world, and there is a lot of media attention.\" After a while, attention and support for the victims decrease, and there is a feeling of disillusionment. Winnenden victim's mother Barbara Nalepa knows the feeling. According to her, politicians have not taken necessary steps to ensure that guns are inaccessible to young people - like the killers in Munich and Winnenden. \"I wake up with bad thoughts in my head and go to sleep feeling sad and angry,\" she says. \"I don't want anyone to say, 'Oh, look, she's the poor woman of the Winnenden victim's family\u2026 I don't want politicians to just throw words in the air. I demand from our leaders that they finally begin to do something [about this problem].\" Feelings of anger and helplessness are normal after a tragedy, says activist Petra Hohn. \"At one moment you feel secure, but you're actually not safe. Everybody around, the wounded, the victims' relatives, everyone who had something to do with the event feels helpless.\" Random attacks also trigger feelings of fear and anxiety, and the feeling of having little control over your own safety, VSE's Altan says, illustrating with the example of terror attacks in the Belgian capital, in which 32 people were killed. \"The Brussels attacks had a depressing effect. People were more cautious about going out to public places, tourist attractions and theaters. There were feelings of wariness and concern. The army was deployed on the streets, and it was a very unsettling environment to live in,\" he tells DW. Supporting survivors and families in the long term At some point, victims' relatives and the wounded have to settle for a sustainable method of coping with the crisis, where they find ways to cope with grief and deal with injuries that might have a huge impact on their lives. Many survivors, for example, may develop handicaps, leading them to change their jobs or move house, says victims support expert Altan. Nicole's killing, for example, has drastically changed the lives of Barbara Nalepa's family. Her 13-year-old twins are out of counseling now, but it's not going to be easy to forget what happened, especially because the recent attacks reopened old wounds. \"It is very difficult to process these feelings of sadness,\" Nalepa says. \"I think it's going to take us a very long time to get over it. My husband and I will have to bear this grief all our lives. We cannot have the same life as we had before and I am sad that I cannot get my old life back.\" Discussions after mass shootings and terror attacks often tend to focus on catching terrorists or the criminals and preventing terror attacks in the future; victims support expert Altan says. However, policymakers need to understand that victims' families and survivors need to be treated with respect and dignity, they need to feel validated and protected, and they need long-term support in terms of legal, emotional and psychological assistance, he concludes.",
